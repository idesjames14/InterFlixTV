1
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.760
Good.

2
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.640
That's nice.

3
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.079
I'd like a wide shot.

4
00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.799
Straighten up a little.

5
00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.959
Smile from the corner of your lips.

6
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.159
Good.

7
00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.439
It's raining.

8
00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.120
Let's get inside.

9
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.560
Mom!

10
00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:53.439
What's the matter?

11
00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.719
Can I play
with my friends over there?

12
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.519
Hmm?

13
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.040
Oh.

14
00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.879
It's starting to rain now.

15
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.359
Alright.

16
00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.959
Thank you!

17
00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.810
Yes!

18
00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.680
Come here!

19
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.039
Hurry up!

20
00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:15.159
Let's play!

21
00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.319
Ones-and-twos!

22
00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:20.719
Ones-and-twos!

23
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.530
You're it!

24
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.719
Go there and close your eyes.

25
00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:28.039
One, two, three,

26
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.810
four, five, six,

27
00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.319
seven, eight, nine,

28
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.840
ten, eleven, twelve,

29
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.159
thirteen, fourteen,

30
00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.400
fifteen, sixteen...

31
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.170
I searched everywhere
but I couldn't find her.

32
00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.730
Calm down.

33
00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.050
I'll help you look again.

34
00:04:56.199 --> 00:04:57.680
Help!

35
00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.680
Help me!

36
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.560
Help!

37
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.730
Help! Please open the door!

38
00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.199
Help me!

39
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:21.959
Where are you?

40
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.800
Rin?

41
00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:46.879
Is this the place?

42
00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:53.879
Mmm.

43
00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:42.959
- Mom.
- Oh?

44
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.879
- Hello.
- Hello.

45
00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:55.399
Come in.

46
00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:57.639
- Have you eaten?
- Not yet.

47
00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:00.079
Aw, you're being affectionate.

48
00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.399
Come on, I just made breakfast.

49
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.480
Hey!

50
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.120
Why are you here?

51
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.920
If you're here,
then I can be here too.

52
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.759
I'm sorry, Mai.
I couldn't get in touch with Rin.

53
00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:32.839
Really?

54
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.600
Isn't Rin here?

55
00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:36.560
Mmm. Tan's not here either.

56
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.279
I couldn't get a hold of him either.

57
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.240
Are they together?

58
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.360
Huh?

59
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.759
They're together?

60
00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:53.879
Adam, track Rin's coordinates
from her phone.

61
00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:55.040
I need her location.

62
00:07:56.759 --> 00:07:58.800
Yes, now! Are you crazy?

63
00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:06.399
What?

64
00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:16.240
Mmm! This smells nice.

65
00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:19.879
They're going to like it.

66
00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:24.439
- Mom.
- Hmm?

67
00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:27.639
Is this really mine?

68
00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:29.839
Of course it is.

69
00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:32.360
Oh, you're a designer now.

70
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.639
You can't wear clothes
like these anymore?

71
00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.360
It's not like that.

72
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.480
You're being affectionate again.
Come on, sit.

73
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.159
Whoa! Basil omelet!

74
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.720
There! Wait a moment.

75
00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.639
Where's your hero?

76
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.600
- Hero?
- Mmm.

77
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.879
Oh, you mean Tanthai?

78
00:08:53.879 --> 00:08:55.330
Mmm. Go and fetch him.

79
00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.879
He'll come down soon.

80
00:08:57.919 --> 00:08:59.120
There he is.

81
00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:04.399
Wait for him first.

82
00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:09.799
Sorry to bother you.

83
00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:12.759
Come. Sit here.

84
00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:15.120
You're being awkward.

85
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.600
Do these clothes feel strange?

86
00:09:18.039 --> 00:09:19.090
A little.

87
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.090
I've cooked up a storm.

88
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.679
Do you like it?
They're Rarin's favorites.

89
00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:26.879
It's a basil omelet.

90
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.330
Here. Try it. It's really good.

91
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:34.120
Why aren't you serving me?

92
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.279
You're an adult now.
You can do it yourself.

93
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.799
You're being strange.

94
00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:41.799
What are you snickering about?

95
00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:44.090
I'm not snickering.

96
00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:45.450
I'm laughing in your face.

97
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:53.679
You two drove all the way here
to see me.

98
00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:54.879
Is something the matter?

99
00:09:56.879 --> 00:09:59.210
- Oh.
- Umm...

100
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.399
Are you getting married?

101
00:10:01.399 --> 00:10:02.519
- No, Mom!
- No.

102
00:10:02.799 --> 00:10:04.679
I'm joking!

103
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.090
Uhh...

104
00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:10.639
- I'm...
- You're pregnant?

105
00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:12.039
- No, Mom!
- No.

106
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.330
I'm joking!

107
00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:16.240
Mom!

108
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.120
What?

109
00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:21.799
Oh, I know.

110
00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:23.399
Or maybe

111
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.960
you wanted to introduce
your boyfriend to me?

112
00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.159
Uhh...

113
00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.559
It's not like that.

114
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.360
Here you go.

115
00:10:40.559 --> 00:10:41.840
Thanks.

116
00:10:42.039 --> 00:10:43.039
You're welcome.

117
00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:46.600
Huh? Are you sure?

118
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.919
Well done, Adam.
You'll be handsomely rewarded.

119
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.090
Okay.

120
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.720
I know where Rarin is now.

121
00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.210
She went to her mom's place
in Khao Yai,

122
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.559
with your little cousin too.

123
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.639
Then let's go find them.

124
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.120
Huh? You're coming too?

125
00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:02.639
Of course.

126
00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:05.440
To look for Tan.

127
00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.080
There's still a lot of work.

128
00:11:09.159 --> 00:11:10.159
Alright.

129
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.919
Call Adam again.

130
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.120
Calling Adam.

131
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.919
Adam, one luxury car in front
of Rarin's studio right now.

132
00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:24.720
What did you say?

133
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.679
Hey! You can't do that!
It's embarrassing!

134
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.519
Adam? Adam? Adam?

135
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.879
What's wrong?

136
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:38.480
There's a bit of a problem.

137
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.799
It's my dad.

138
00:11:41.799 --> 00:11:44.720
He always confiscates my stuff
when we argue.

139
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.720
The holiday house, the condo,

140
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.440
and now the car.

141
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.799
Then how did you get here?

142
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.879
Taxi.

143
00:11:58.679 --> 00:12:00.120
Why are you laughing?
Are you bullying me?

144
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.159
You're adorable.

145
00:12:03.039 --> 00:12:04.080
We can use my car.

146
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.080
Mmm.

147
00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.639
Sorry to bother you.

148
00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:11.039
But I'm warning you now,

149
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.080
that my car...

150
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.720
Hey.

151
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.279
What?

152
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.679
What now? It's old, the AC's not
working, and it's so slow.

153
00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:29.919
And what now?

154
00:12:29.919 --> 00:12:31.919
I warned you.

155
00:12:31.919 --> 00:12:33.200
Quit complaining already.

156
00:12:40.039 --> 00:12:41.240
I wasn't complaining that much.

157
00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:44.200
Whoa.

158
00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.480
Alright. What's wrong with it?

159
00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:49.960
You know how to fix it?

160
00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:53.559
So what's wrong?

161
00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.240
She's just tired.

162
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.159
- Tired?
- Mmm.

163
00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:01.679
Cloudy, hang in there.
Just a little further.

164
00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.840
This piece of scrap metal
is called Cloudy?

165
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.200
Piece of scrap metal?

166
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.519
Her name is Cloudy.

167
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:10.639
- Cloudy?
- Right.

168
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.320
Come on.

169
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.480
That's it.

170
00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:21.159
Yeesh!

171
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.600
- That's all?
- Mmm!

172
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.759
Come on. Get in the car.

173
00:13:37.559 --> 00:13:38.840
What kind of car is this?

174
00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:47.639
Is your foot on the gas?

175
00:13:47.639 --> 00:13:49.000
It is.

176
00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.480
Ahem.

177
00:13:58.879 --> 00:13:59.879
Oh?

178
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.360
Mom.

179
00:14:01.679 --> 00:14:03.000
When did you get here?

180
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.559
A while ago.

181
00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:06.879
I saw you happily
washing the dishes,

182
00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:08.639
so I didn't want to interrupt.

183
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.360
Come on, Mom.

184
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.960
You're having a field day
teasing me.

185
00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.200
Have a seat.

186
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.720
You never helped me do the dishes
when you were younger.

187
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.639
Dad always scolded you.

188
00:14:25.639 --> 00:14:29.279
You were always playing dress-up
with your friends.

189
00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:33.600
That's why I grew up
to be so beautiful.

190
00:14:33.919 --> 00:14:35.960
I think you take after me.

191
00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.600
Oh, now you're taking the credit?

192
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.960
Look at you! The nose and chin
are from me.

193
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.399
You can't deny that.

194
00:14:49.679 --> 00:14:51.320
Do you have anything to tell me?

195
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.320
Hmm?

196
00:14:56.679 --> 00:14:57.960
Mmm.

197
00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.440
Well,

198
00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.720
I want to rest.

199
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:04.960
Mmm.

200
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:09.919
And I don't know what to choose

201
00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.679
or who to listen

202
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.080
so that it's the best thing
to do for now.

203
00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:20.080
Sometimes

204
00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:23.360
we don't need to do our best
for someone else.

205
00:15:23.919 --> 00:15:25.080
I believe

206
00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:28.080
the best you can do for now

207
00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:30.759
is to listen to your own heart.

208
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.440
Hmm?

209
00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:35.559
Okay.

210
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.519
Are you happier now?

211
00:15:39.879 --> 00:15:40.879
Mmm.

212
00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.399
Excuse me,

213
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.919
where is Kati's food?

214
00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.360
Kati!

215
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.919
I'll be right back.

216
00:15:47.919 --> 00:15:49.120
- Kati!
- Oh?

217
00:15:49.919 --> 00:15:51.600
Wow.

218
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.879
- He's hungry.
- You prefer the cat to me now?

219
00:15:54.879 --> 00:15:56.320
- He's hungry.
- Where have you been?

220
00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:59.399
Where did you find him?

221
00:15:59.399 --> 00:16:00.879
Next door.

222
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.960
Here.

223
00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:13.080
Mom cut it up for you.

224
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.240
Thank you.

225
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.240
Your mom is so kind,

226
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.320
unlike her daughter.

227
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.080
What?

228
00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:24.240
Her daughter

229
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.320
is both talented and cute.

230
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.200
You're acting strange,

231
00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:35.960
being sweet and all.

232
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.960
You don't like it?

233
00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:47.039
I think

234
00:16:47.879 --> 00:16:49.240
from now on,

235
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.440
we should tell each other
exactly what we're thinking.

236
00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:55.679
We can hear each other
through the rain anyway.

237
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.320
Hmm.

238
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.680
Well, for some things,

239
00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:08.480
it's embarrassing

240
00:17:09.519 --> 00:17:10.799
to say it out loud.

241
00:17:11.519 --> 00:17:12.519
Embarrassing?

242
00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.759
What's an embarrassing thought
for you then?

243
00:17:16.279 --> 00:17:17.359
Is it something dirty?

244
00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:18.359
Jerk.

245
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.599
Who's going to think
about such things?

246
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:23.720
What are you thinking about now?

247
00:17:28.599 --> 00:17:30.079
About the future.

248
00:17:33.559 --> 00:17:34.650
What about it?

249
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.170
Hmm.

250
00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:41.920
Well,

251
00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:44.519
the future

252
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.480
of me still being a designer.

253
00:17:49.599 --> 00:17:53.480
And I will make my brand
known internationally.

254
00:17:56.599 --> 00:17:59.599
I want to see people happy

255
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.720
wearing my clothes.

256
00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.039
What about you?
What are you thinking?

257
00:18:08.039 --> 00:18:09.039
I'm thinking about you.

258
00:18:14.759 --> 00:18:16.200
I'm thinking about how

259
00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.960
I want to spend my life with you
in a small house

260
00:18:21.079 --> 00:18:23.079
and have a lovely kid with you.

261
00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.759
And if Rung could
see us happy together,

262
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.319
it would be nice.

263
00:18:37.359 --> 00:18:38.359
Mmm.

264
00:18:46.039 --> 00:18:47.839
Can I ask something about Rung?

265
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.200
Mmm.

266
00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.170
Uhh...

267
00:18:58.559 --> 00:19:02.920
So what actually caused
her vegetative state?

268
00:19:06.279 --> 00:19:07.279
But

269
00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.200
if you don't feel like
talking about it,

270
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:11.890
you don't have to.

271
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.599
Rung overdosed on sleeping pills.

272
00:19:27.319 --> 00:19:30.200
I guess she must've had something
stressful on her mind.

273
00:19:31.039 --> 00:19:32.519
But she wouldn't tell anyone.

274
00:19:40.119 --> 00:19:41.440
What if Rung...

275
00:19:49.519 --> 00:19:51.079
It's been three years already.

276
00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.279
I've pretty much accepted it.

277
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:01.960
But now,

278
00:20:02.359 --> 00:20:05.359
we should get on with my plan.

279
00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:07.119
What plan?

280
00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.650
The plan to have
a lovely kid together.

281
00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.119
Hey! Wait!

282
00:20:14.359 --> 00:20:15.410
Wait!

283
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:17.920
Ugh!

284
00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:21.920
I'm going!

285
00:20:22.319 --> 00:20:23.410
Mmm!

286
00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.720
Bye!

287
00:20:25.079 --> 00:20:26.079
Rin!

288
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.650
- Bye!
- You don't want kids?

289
00:20:40.839 --> 00:20:41.839
There.

290
00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:44.960
Oh,

291
00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.410
those two lovebirds flew here.

292
00:20:49.079 --> 00:20:50.559
- They're going to get it.
- Are you crazy?

293
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:53.039
You said it yourself that
they're at Rarin's mom's place.

294
00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:55.559
That's true.

295
00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:57.960
Excuse me, is there a mechanic...

296
00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.680
For rest, it's 500 baht.
For stay, it's 1,500 baht.

297
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.799
- Huh?
- We're staying overnight.

298
00:21:01.799 --> 00:21:04.319
Hold on. Aren't we looking
for a mechanic?

299
00:21:04.519 --> 00:21:06.799
What mechanic? It's late already.

300
00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:09.240
Look at the car. What if it
breaks down on the way.

301
00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:10.799
Let's stay here.

302
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:12.200
Okay.

303
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.799
Two rooms, please.

304
00:21:13.799 --> 00:21:16.000
- We only have one single room left.
- What?

305
00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.559
Okay. It's 1,500 then?

306
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.440
No need.

307
00:21:22.279 --> 00:21:23.480
Do you accept credit cards?

308
00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.359
Don't even bother. Your dad's
probably canceled all of them.

309
00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.759
It feels like
you're badmouthing him.

310
00:21:31.319 --> 00:21:33.200
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

311
00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:35.000
They're staying overnight.

312
00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:39.920
Turn right. it's at
the end of the way.

313
00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:41.759
- The end of the way?
- That's right.

314
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:44.440
There aren't any other rooms?

315
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.890
Hey! Stop making such a fuss.

316
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.240
You're acting as if
we've never slept together.

317
00:21:52.039 --> 00:21:53.599
Stop smirking
or I'll smack you in the head.

318
00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.759
Get in the car.

319
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.759
Oh, Rin?

320
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.880
Can I come in?

321
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Sure.

322
00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.960
And

323
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.640
can I sleep here?

324
00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:49.519
I didn't expect you to go along
with my plan so soon.

325
00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.440
Wait, wait, wait.

326
00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.440
Please, come in.

327
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.240
Hey.

328
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.480
Go and sleep in the bed.

329
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.359
Why did you take off your top?
I'm not going to.

330
00:23:39.359 --> 00:23:40.359
Alright.

331
00:23:40.599 --> 00:23:42.799
I'll sleep here.
You go and sleep on the bed.

332
00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:44.160
You might sprain your neck.

333
00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:50.680
Promise me you won't
do anything to me.

334
00:23:51.799 --> 00:23:54.240
Who do you think I am?
I won't do anything.

335
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.960
Who knows? Last time,

336
00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.559
before I knew it, you were like...

337
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.720
already.

338
00:24:03.319 --> 00:24:06.720
Okay, okay. I promise.
Let's go to bed.

339
00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.240
You can go ahead.

340
00:24:11.599 --> 00:24:12.720
Go!

341
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.359
What's up with you?

342
00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:28.599
I'm turning off the lights.

343
00:24:28.599 --> 00:24:29.960
Hold on!

344
00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.839
What's wrong?

345
00:24:34.319 --> 00:24:35.319
It's dark.

346
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.240
You're acting childishly.

347
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.400
Get in.

348
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.200
Mmm.

349
00:25:06.759 --> 00:25:08.559
Don't do anything to me.

350
00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.440
Mai.

351
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.160
Hmm?

352
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.480
This is kind of fun actually.

353
00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:34.960
The love hotel?

354
00:25:35.359 --> 00:25:36.359
What?

355
00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:38.880
I mean being out on an adventure.

356
00:25:39.559 --> 00:25:40.559
Oh.

357
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.400
My usual lifestyle

358
00:25:46.359 --> 00:25:48.559
is simple, without any obstacles.

359
00:25:49.759 --> 00:25:50.880
But today,

360
00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.079
it's been bumpy since morning.

361
00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.000
The car was hot. You're bad at
driving. Now we're at a love hotel.

362
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.559
It adds a nice flavor to life.

363
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:06.240
Wow, the flavor of life.

364
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.400
Easy for you to say. You were born
with a silver spoon in your mouth.

365
00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:12.960
If you say this to other people,

366
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.720
they're going to hate you.

367
00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:16.839
I didn't mean for it
to sound like that.

368
00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.599
I'm actually jealous of you.

369
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.960
I've always been forced

370
00:26:21.839 --> 00:26:23.000
to do everything in life.

371
00:26:23.799 --> 00:26:25.640
I always have to ask Dad
about anything I do.

372
00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.799
I always have to think
about the business.

373
00:26:28.519 --> 00:26:30.440
I never get to live life freely.

374
00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:34.400
If possible,

375
00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:39.880
I'd like to live my life
the way I want

376
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.440
and go out in the world
on an adventure.

377
00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:47.160
Alright. Then hurry up
and go to sleep

378
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.960
so you can go on
with your adventure.

379
00:26:55.079 --> 00:26:57.640
Mmm. Are you sleeping?

380
00:27:02.599 --> 00:27:03.599
Mai?

381
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.839
That night really wasn't
a big deal to you?

382
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:40.839
Help!

383
00:27:42.079 --> 00:27:43.799
Help me!

384
00:27:59.359 --> 00:28:01.119
Where are you?

385
00:28:04.319 --> 00:28:08.240
I'm here! Help me!
I'm in a really small room!

386
00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:11.359
Don't be afraid.
I'm coming to help you.

387
00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:13.279
Keep talking.

388
00:28:15.119 --> 00:28:17.640
Can you hear my voice?

389
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.440
That's right. I can hear you.

390
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.480
Don't be afraid. I'm heading over.

391
00:28:23.319 --> 00:28:26.200
I was playing hide-and-seek
and hid here.

392
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.559
No one's found me yet.

393
00:28:30.039 --> 00:28:32.079
I'm going to find you.

394
00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:04.319
Oh, Rarin?

395
00:29:04.599 --> 00:29:06.079
Come here. Let's go.

396
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.680
How are you feeling?

397
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.119
Are you okay?

398
00:29:24.319 --> 00:29:26.400
Help! Help!

399
00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.160
Rin?

400
00:29:32.519 --> 00:29:33.519
It's me.

401
00:29:35.559 --> 00:29:38.559
I dreamed of the first day we met.

402
00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:41.240
But you weren't there.

403
00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:47.759
I'm right here.

404
00:29:48.319 --> 00:29:49.519
It's okay, Rin.

405
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:51.640
I'm right here.

406
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.720
Calm down.

407
00:30:00.319 --> 00:30:02.240
I think you've been stressed lately.

408
00:30:02.559 --> 00:30:04.319
So it is affecting your dreams too.

409
00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.480
You're having nightmares.

410
00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:11.319
It might get better over time.

411
00:30:13.839 --> 00:30:15.759
I'm afraid I might disappear.

412
00:30:26.799 --> 00:30:28.680
I remember when I was younger,

413
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.480
I saw

414
00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.000
a group of kids
playing hide-and-seek.

415
00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.960
Among them, there was a girl.

416
00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.119
She was very cute.

417
00:30:45.799 --> 00:30:47.640
I instantly fell in love with her.

418
00:30:50.039 --> 00:30:51.839
But later, she disappeared.

419
00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.559
No one's ever found her.

420
00:30:59.279 --> 00:31:00.880
I don't know

421
00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:05.279
if it's fate or just the rain

422
00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.519
that enabled me to hear her voice

423
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.759
and find her.

424
00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.119
And now,

425
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:19.920
that girl is in front of me,

426
00:31:21.559 --> 00:31:23.799
right here with me.

427
00:31:26.319 --> 00:31:28.519
I've found you once.

428
00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:34.279
From now on, no matter
where you disappear to,

429
00:31:36.319 --> 00:31:38.440
I'll always find you.

430
00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.240
What if I'm not the person
you think I am?

431
00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.160
Will you still love me?

432
00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:52.319
I will.

433
00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.400
Tan,

434
00:31:57.799 --> 00:31:58.960
don't answer so quickly.

435
00:32:03.079 --> 00:32:04.960
No matter what happens,

436
00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:08.319
I will always love you.

437
00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.920
Ah!

438
00:32:54.359 --> 00:32:55.759
What's the racket?

439
00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.559
It's 9 a.m.
I'm going to take a shower.

440
00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.880
What's up with her?

441
00:33:15.759 --> 00:33:17.160
She can't be trusted.

442
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.160
Honey.

443
00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:50.920
Porsche,

444
00:33:51.599 --> 00:33:52.599
let's go.

445
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Alright.

446
00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.759
Why did the check-up take so long?
I'm hungry.

447
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.920
You're hungry?
You sound like a child.

448
00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.480
- Let's go.
- Alright.

449
00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.920
What?

450
00:34:12.559 --> 00:34:13.559
Huh?

451
00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:14.840
Where's the ring?

452
00:34:15.079 --> 00:34:16.159
What ring?

453
00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:17.719
The ring I used to propose to Rin.

454
00:34:18.039 --> 00:34:19.039
It's not here!

455
00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.400
Where did it go?

456
00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.440
Did I drop it somewhere?

457
00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:25.920
This one?

458
00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.400
Yes, thanks so much.

459
00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:32.199
Honestly, why haven't you
moved on from Rin?

460
00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:35.119
Why would I do that? Give it to me.

461
00:34:39.079 --> 00:34:40.480
You know

462
00:34:41.119 --> 00:34:43.840
that she chose Tan.
It's hopeless for you.

463
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Why would you go there
and make them uncomfortable?

464
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.159
Isn't that selfish?

465
00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:49.809
What are you talking about?
You wouldn't understand.

466
00:34:49.809 --> 00:34:51.000
You don't even know love.

467
00:34:58.559 --> 00:35:00.119
I might not understand you

468
00:35:00.599 --> 00:35:03.000
but I know when you should stop.

469
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.840
You have no right
to lecture me about that.

470
00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.119
I can make my own decisions.

471
00:35:08.329 --> 00:35:10.519
Hey? Where are you going?

472
00:35:10.639 --> 00:35:11.679
- Porsche!
- Leave me alone!

473
00:35:12.039 --> 00:35:13.719
Porsche!

474
00:35:14.159 --> 00:35:15.880
Rich kid! Come back here!

475
00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:18.199
Really!

476
00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.559
How is it? Are you going back today?

477
00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:32.329
That's right.

478
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.639
I'm taking Tan out
for a bicycle ride.

479
00:35:35.639 --> 00:35:37.289
We'll go back after that.

480
00:35:37.289 --> 00:35:38.400
Oh.

481
00:35:42.329 --> 00:35:43.809
- Rarin.
- Hmm?

482
00:35:45.289 --> 00:35:47.329
Can you still hear a voice

483
00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.809
every time it rains?

484
00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.880
You know about

485
00:35:55.289 --> 00:35:57.920
the voice in the rain?

486
00:35:59.199 --> 00:36:01.960
Of course, I know.
I can hear it too.

487
00:36:05.719 --> 00:36:06.719
And

488
00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:10.880
the voice you hear

489
00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:13.119
is Dad's, right?

490
00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:21.119
Sometimes love is too complicated

491
00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:25.440
for a human being
to understand it all.

492
00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:29.809
Actually, I believed

493
00:36:30.039 --> 00:36:33.360
that the man whose voice I heard
was the person I should marry.

494
00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.840
But in the end,

495
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.519
I chose to marry your dad.

496
00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:40.159
After that,

497
00:36:40.719 --> 00:36:44.000
that man's voice
just completely disappeared.

498
00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:54.769
Don't tell me

499
00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.119
that the voice you hear
is Tanthai's.

500
00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:02.079
Yes.

501
00:37:02.679 --> 00:37:04.400
It's his.

502
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.400
I just want to tell you that

503
00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:11.400
no matter how special the power is,
don't rely on it too much.

504
00:37:15.159 --> 00:37:16.159
Okay.

505
00:37:17.119 --> 00:37:18.639
If you love him,

506
00:37:18.809 --> 00:37:21.400
just listen to your heart.

507
00:37:22.289 --> 00:37:24.769
Okay. You should go now.

508
00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.360
Tanthai's waiting for you.

509
00:37:37.199 --> 00:37:38.599
Do you want a ride?

510
00:37:43.079 --> 00:37:45.360
Hey. I'm sorry.

511
00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.960
I said that
because I'm worried about you.

512
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.960
But if you insist on going,

513
00:37:53.079 --> 00:37:55.079
I won't stop you. Okay?

514
00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.119
Buckle up and help me
with the directions.

515
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.519
At the sign, go south.

516
00:38:18.679 --> 00:38:21.480
- Which way is south?
- Left, maybe?

517
00:38:22.039 --> 00:38:24.840
- Right... right
- What?

518
00:38:25.039 --> 00:38:28.639
- and go straight or... go right.
- Okay, right.

519
00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:30.920
- Go northeast.
- Huh?

520
00:38:31.159 --> 00:38:33.639
That way! That way!

521
00:38:33.769 --> 00:38:35.239
It's the same way.

522
00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.769
Go straight.

523
00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.679
- What way is this?
- It's the wrong way!

524
00:38:39.679 --> 00:38:40.679
Hey!

525
00:38:42.519 --> 00:38:43.719
What kind of braking is that?

526
00:38:43.719 --> 00:38:44.920
What kind of map-reading is that?

527
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.199
I've never done it before!

528
00:38:53.559 --> 00:38:54.559
I'm sorry.

529
00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.519
I won't do it again.

530
00:39:00.719 --> 00:39:02.159
Go straight for 200 meters.

531
00:39:02.719 --> 00:39:03.920
Turn left.

532
00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:08.960
Right.

533
00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.199
Rin will probably be back in Bangkok
by the time we get there.

534
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.329
I tried my best.

535
00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.400
I know you did.

536
00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:21.719
But for some things,
shouldn't you just stop?

537
00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:25.809
I thought you were not going
to stop me from finding Rin.

538
00:39:26.289 --> 00:39:27.559
I'm not.

539
00:39:30.159 --> 00:39:32.519
I'm just wondering
if you really love her.

540
00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.599
What do you mean by that?

541
00:39:36.769 --> 00:39:38.639
When you said that
I don't understand love,

542
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.119
I admit it. You're right.

543
00:39:41.719 --> 00:39:43.960
But at least I know that true love

544
00:39:44.599 --> 00:39:47.239
means you should want
the person you love to be happy.

545
00:39:48.159 --> 00:39:49.639
If you really love Rin,

546
00:39:50.119 --> 00:39:51.519
you should let her go.

547
00:39:51.679 --> 00:39:54.400
Let her do what her heart desires
and not pull her back.

548
00:39:58.599 --> 00:39:59.679
I love Rin.

549
00:40:04.039 --> 00:40:05.360
I really do.

550
00:40:11.329 --> 00:40:12.639
I love her.

551
00:40:13.519 --> 00:40:14.920
Do you hear me? I love her.

552
00:40:15.639 --> 00:40:17.559
Porsche! Where are you going?

553
00:40:19.809 --> 00:40:20.809
Porsche!

554
00:40:21.239 --> 00:40:22.239
Porsche!

555
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.769
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to keep going.

556
00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.119
Are you feeling okay now?

557
00:42:13.679 --> 00:42:14.679
Let's go.

558
00:42:15.199 --> 00:42:16.199
To where?

559
00:42:16.559 --> 00:42:17.639
Home.

560
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.559
How is it?
Is the atmosphere nice here?

561
00:42:39.559 --> 00:42:40.599
I like it.

562
00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:45.440
I think

563
00:42:45.559 --> 00:42:48.559
I'm ready to go back and work.

564
00:42:49.679 --> 00:42:52.639
I took a day off from work.

565
00:42:52.809 --> 00:42:55.039
The staff must be worried sick.

566
00:42:56.289 --> 00:42:57.960
I also skipped work.

567
00:42:58.639 --> 00:43:00.599
I'm going to get scolded
until my ears bleed.

568
00:43:02.159 --> 00:43:05.159
Let's go back
and accept our punishment.

569
00:43:06.079 --> 00:43:07.159
Mmm.

570
00:43:07.159 --> 00:43:08.639
That's good.

571
00:43:08.639 --> 00:43:11.239
I need to discuss something
about your schedule too.

572
00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.480
I'd like you to walk the runway
for my brand

573
00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.809
at BFW.

574
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.400
BF what now?

575
00:43:19.599 --> 00:43:20.840
Bangkok Fashion Week.

576
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.840
Oh.

577
00:43:25.809 --> 00:43:27.880
I think Rung mentioned it once.

578
00:43:29.079 --> 00:43:31.199
If we collaborate,

579
00:43:31.639 --> 00:43:33.809
then it's like we're living

580
00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.809
Rung's dream as well.

581
00:43:38.599 --> 00:43:39.599
Mmm.

582
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:44.840
I'll do my best

583
00:43:45.519 --> 00:43:47.159
for you

584
00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.480
and Rung.

585
00:43:52.679 --> 00:43:54.000
If she heard this,

586
00:43:54.199 --> 00:43:55.760
she would be so happy.

587
00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.679
Porsche got kicked out of the house.
So I let him stay here.

588
00:44:35.679 --> 00:44:37.400
Mai, this is my house.

589
00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.039
Mai, who's the woman upstairs?

590
00:44:39.039 --> 00:44:40.320
She said she's thirsty.

591
00:44:40.559 --> 00:44:42.960
This is Rarin, my girlfriend.

592
00:44:43.079 --> 00:44:45.000
You have a girlfriend?

593
00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.960
You're a designer as well?

594
00:44:48.159 --> 00:44:51.800
I don't really remember
what kind of designer I was.

595
00:44:52.519 --> 00:44:56.039
Hasn't your memory returned?
