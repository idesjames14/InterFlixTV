00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.920
If you want authentic,
go with Pantang soda.

2
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.719
Cut!

3
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.280
Okay. All good.

4
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.719
Okay. Very good.

5
00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.200
You can get ready
for the next scene.

6
00:01:49.519 --> 00:01:51.840
- Can I check the monitor?
- Sure.

7
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.560
Of course.

8
00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:57.239
Excuse me, I don't think
I was expressive enough.

9
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.719
Can I do another take?

10
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.760
But I think you were okay just now.

11
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.640
Why do you think that
you weren't expressive enough?

12
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.919
I want to do it differently.

13
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.439
If I add a refreshing flair to it,

14
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.199
it will probably be more in tune
with the product.

15
00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.810
That must mean that you've done
your research on our brand.

16
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.599
Can you do another take then?

17
00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.039
Okay.

18
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.879
Alright. Let's do another one.

19
00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.280
Okay. Everyone reset.
Give it another go.

20
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.439
If you want authentic,
go with Pantang soda.

21
00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:37.560
Cut!

22
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.960
Hey, hey.

23
00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:50.639
- Hey.
- Hmm?

24
00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.000
That was awesome. The client is
singing your praises.

25
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.120
Mmm. That's good.

26
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.520
Ever since you've
changed your image,

27
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.080
everyone wants to book you.

28
00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.759
It's going to be a little tiring.

29
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.199
But don't worry.

30
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.680
I'll accept every job for you.

31
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.319
Are you really worried about me?

32
00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:11.400
I'm worried.

33
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.680
But we must strike while
the iron is hot.

34
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.400
People are stoked about you.

35
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.879
Mmm.

36
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.120
Thanks to Rarin.

37
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.360
I think it's because I'm handsome.

38
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.439
It has nothing to do with her.

39
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.240
Right. Handsome guy.

40
00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.400
Oh,

41
00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:31.199
you've been getting a lot of
fan mail recently.

42
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.199
- Here.
- Naturally. I'm hot.

43
00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.280
Yeesh.

44
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.360
Here.

45
00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:39.879
Open and read it too.
Don't just leave it lying around.

46
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.280
Mm-hmm.

47
00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:45.800
I'll be right back.

48
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.560
Hello?

49
00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.959
Is the paperwork all good to go?

50
00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:33.759
All done.

51
00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.519
I'll contact you

52
00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:38.399
as soon the bank approves it.

53
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.759
Okay.

54
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.079
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

55
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.730
(Profit and loss statement:
-476,000.80)

56
00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:57.050
As for the outfit,

57
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.120
you can take it if you want.

58
00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:02.730
But I'll pay the one million baht.

59
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.279
I have to excuse myself now.

60
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.959
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

61
00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:19.610
Here's your tea.

62
00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.680
Shouldn't you rest a bit?

63
00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:29.079
Your health will bear
the brunt of overworking.

64
00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:31.240
I'm fine, Da.

65
00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:32.519
I'm doing okay.

66
00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:35.399
Mmm!

67
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.800
I might give everyone
the day off tomorrow.

68
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.199
So that they can have fun
at my birthday party.

69
00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:44.600
Oh!

70
00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:48.639
Hearing the party host saying that
has made me motivated to work.

71
00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:50.720
That's good.

72
00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:53.519
Uhh...

73
00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.600
Rin, you have a guest.

74
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.879
Who is it?

75
00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:02.680
She said her name is Praew,
Porche's younger sister.

76
00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:04.720
Oh, okay.

77
00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:08.959
Okay.

78
00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:11.120
I'll be back.

79
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.720
Praew?

80
00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:26.079
Oh!

81
00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:28.920
Hello, Rarin. Give me a hug.

82
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.800
I've missed you.

83
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.560
I haven't seen you in ages.
How are you doing?

84
00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.560
I'm alright.

85
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.639
What about you?

86
00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.560
I'm more than alright.

87
00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:42.160
Soon,

88
00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.839
I'll be marrying Mark.

89
00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:46.959
- Mark?
- Mmm!

90
00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:49.120
- Congratulations!
- Thanks!

91
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.079
So I'm here to ask you

92
00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:53.480
to make a wedding dress for me.

93
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.480
Wow, this is such an honor.

94
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.399
I'll do my best.

95
00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:59.959
- Thank you!
- Of course.

96
00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:03.360
By the way, I'm having
a birthday party tomorrow.

97
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.879
Are you free to come?

98
00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:06.439
Oh, wow!

99
00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:08.160
Of course, I'll come.

100
00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:12.279
The theme is

101
00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:13.360
wonderland fantasy.

102
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.480
I'll definitely be there.

103
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.959
It's going to be so much fun.

104
00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:17.439
I'll come for sure.

105
00:07:17.439 --> 00:07:19.519
I'll bring Porsche along as well.

106
00:07:21.079 --> 00:07:22.319
Uhh...

107
00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:26.360
I'm not sure if he'll want to come
or not.

108
00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:28.879
Hmm? Why not?

109
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.959
Don't tell me he's
causing trouble again.

110
00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:34.959
A little.

111
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.560
Sometimes my brother
acts impulsively

112
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.399
and behaves childishly.

113
00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:47.040
Please don't mind him.

114
00:07:53.519 --> 00:07:55.360
Anyway, as for today,

115
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.199
let's get you measured.

116
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.399
Let's go to my office

117
00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:02.240
and discuss what kind
of dress you'd like.

118
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.319
Sure.

119
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.959
I'm ready.

120
00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:06.639
I've given it a bit of thought.

121
00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:07.920
I'd like it to be

122
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.800
like a princess.

123
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.279
- This way.
- Okay.

124
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.560
Rin,

125
00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:25.319
I have to go home now.

126
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.240
Okay. I'll see you
at the party tomorrow.

127
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.680
Definitely.

128
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.160
Oh,

129
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.450
I've prepared your outfit.

130
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.679
Don't worry.

131
00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.330
Thank you, Da.

132
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.450
Also, don't forget to tidy up

133
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.240
so the place won't look messy
when the guests arrive.

134
00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:45.559
All done. I've put everything
in the storeroom.

135
00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:47.720
- I'll see you then.
- See you.

136
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.240
(Tanthai Missed Call)

137
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.960
Hello?

138
00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:08.960
Where are you?
Why didn't you answer my calls?

139
00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:11.919
I'm at the studio.

140
00:09:12.919 --> 00:09:15.279
Work was really busy today

141
00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:17.480
so I didn't check my phone.

142
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.559
I just finished work.

143
00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.600
Are you going out now?

144
00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:25.360
Mmm.

145
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.759
I'm probably going back
to the condo.

146
00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:29.960
Everyone's gone home for the day.

147
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:32.240
Why did you call me anyway?

148
00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:34.559
I just wanted to know
if you were doing okay.

149
00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:36.210
What kind of question is that?

150
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.840
Of course I'm okay.

151
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.159
Well...

152
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.919
By the way,

153
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.120
do you have any plans

154
00:09:51.279 --> 00:09:52.399
tomorrow?

155
00:09:52.879 --> 00:09:54.090
Are you available?

156
00:09:58.039 --> 00:09:59.159
I am.

157
00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:00.639
What's the matter?

158
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.480
The thing is...

159
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.399
Hey!

160
00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:09.450
- What is this?
- Rin, what's going on?

161
00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:11.090
Well...

162
00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:12.960
My car has a flat tire.

163
00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.159
A flat tire?

164
00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:18.039
I probably drove over a nail
or something.

165
00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:24.720
I need to call a mechanic.

166
00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:27.840
Don't. Just leave it there.

167
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.639
You can get the car tomorrow.

168
00:10:29.799 --> 00:10:31.330
Hurry back to the condo.

169
00:10:31.879 --> 00:10:33.330
You're alone, right?

170
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.840
Do you want me to pick you up?

171
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.519
It's okay.

172
00:10:36.639 --> 00:10:38.279
It's just a flat tire.

173
00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:40.240
It's not a big deal.

174
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.330
It is!

175
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.480
Just believe me, okay?

176
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.759
Why should I?

177
00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:53.720
Because I'm worried about you.

178
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.960
Well, then.

179
00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:12.600
I'll call a taxi.

180
00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.200
Okay?

181
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.120
Mmm. Okay.

182
00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:23.639
Take care of yourself, alright?

183
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.120
Call me right away
if there's a problem.

184
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.799
You're being strange.

185
00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:31.559
Are you okay?

186
00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:33.720
I'm fine.

187
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.879
Take care of yourself.

188
00:11:37.639 --> 00:11:39.279
Oh, Tan!

189
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.720
Wait...

190
00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:43.240
Uh, hello?

191
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.080
Darn.

192
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.240
I haven't told him
about the party tomorrow.

193
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:16.519
(Tan, I'm the only person who can
love you. She doesn't deserve you.)

194
00:12:37.679 --> 00:12:41.039
(Don't tell anyone we're talking,
especially Mai.)

195
00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:44.399
(I don't want harm to come to her.)

196
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:59.320
(Next time, it won't just
be a flat tire.)

197
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.120
Your room's messy again?

198
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.320
I just tidied it up the other day.

199
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.039
You're reading your fan mail?

200
00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:18.960
That's right.

201
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.519
Oh my gosh!

202
00:13:21.639 --> 00:13:23.120
What's gotten into you?

203
00:13:23.679 --> 00:13:24.799
Is something the matter?

204
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.519
I'm going to tidy up your room.

205
00:13:26.519 --> 00:13:27.559
Just keep reading.

206
00:13:34.919 --> 00:13:37.320
There's a live online interview
at 10 a.m.

207
00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:40.039
There's casting
for a new drama at 2 p.m.

208
00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.759
There's an event at Siam at 6 p.m.

209
00:13:42.759 --> 00:13:45.639
And you're having dinner
with the brand owner at 8 p.m.

210
00:13:48.399 --> 00:13:49.480
Did you hear me?

211
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.080
I heard you, warden.

212
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.840
Warden?

213
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.919
I understand. You probably
feel like a prisoner...

214
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:05.480
The workload will be a little heavy.

215
00:14:06.159 --> 00:14:07.799
So I'm here to help you tidy up

216
00:14:07.799 --> 00:14:09.559
and try to find you a day
that you're free

217
00:14:09.559 --> 00:14:11.799
so you can do this and that

218
00:14:12.039 --> 00:14:13.399
and read your fan mail.

219
00:14:14.879 --> 00:14:15.879
Mmm.

220
00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:17.519
Jeez.

221
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.519
People see you
creating a good image.

222
00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:25.039
But if they see your messy room,

223
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.080
the press is going to have a heyday.

224
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.600
Seriously?

225
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.519
What about this box?

226
00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:38.919
Tan,

227
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.559
are these your photos?

228
00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:43.799
A farewell party when I graduated.

229
00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:51.360
Just leave them there.

230
00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.399
I'll take them with me
when I go home tonight.

231
00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.720
You know how to participate
in this kind of thing?

232
00:14:58.279 --> 00:14:59.559
That's hilarious.

233
00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:04.120
I'll just leave them here.

234
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.519
Scoot over. I'm sitting down.

235
00:15:10.519 --> 00:15:11.639
You can't

236
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.240
go home tonight.

237
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.679
Don't you have to go
to a party with me?

238
00:15:14.919 --> 00:15:15.919
What party?

239
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.679
Rin's birthday party.

240
00:15:17.679 --> 00:15:19.120
Didn't she invite you?

241
00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.159
It's her birthday today?

242
00:15:23.159 --> 00:15:25.399
That's right.

243
00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:27.559
She's throwing a theme party too.

244
00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:29.120
The theme is wonderland.

245
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.960
But you don't have to dress up much.

246
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.639
Just pick something that's polite.

247
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.159
I don't think I'll go.

248
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.039
What's up with you?

249
00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.720
Going to a party is
like having a day off.

250
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.440
I'm not going.

251
00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:46.960
I'll go by myself then.

252
00:15:48.159 --> 00:15:49.639
I need to think about

253
00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:51.639
what I'm going to dress up as

254
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.960
and buy a present too.

255
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.120
What are you going to buy her?

256
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.320
Probably some accessories.

257
00:16:00.679 --> 00:16:01.840
She'll probably like them.

258
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.639
Accessories?

259
00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:08.200
But if you ask me,

260
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.799
I think it might be good

261
00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:11.480
to get something
that's one of a kind.

262
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.360
Something that's like a secret
between the two of you.

263
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.840
One of a kind?

264
00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:21.840
Look at your face!
I think you want to go.

265
00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.919
What?

266
00:16:23.159 --> 00:16:24.399
I'm not going.

267
00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.480
You got so diligent all of a sudden.

268
00:16:28.039 --> 00:16:30.519
- What?
- Alright. I'll go by myself.

269
00:16:35.559 --> 00:16:36.639
Are you really not going to go?

270
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.759
No, I'm not.

271
00:16:39.919 --> 00:16:41.000
Are you sure?

272
00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:42.639
Yes!

273
00:16:42.919 --> 00:16:44.000
Come again?

274
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.240
Just leave!

275
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.159
What now?

276
00:17:01.399 --> 00:17:02.559
I said I'm not...

277
00:17:03.919 --> 00:17:04.920
Uhh...

278
00:17:15.559 --> 00:17:17.170
Your room is

279
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.920
very tidy.

280
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.240
I thought it'd be messier.

281
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:24.839
Well,

282
00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.599
despite my looks

283
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.680
I'm a clean type of guy.

284
00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:34.319
Anyway,

285
00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:36.279
what's the matter?

286
00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:40.279
It's my birthday today,

287
00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:41.960
so I...

288
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.960
Umm...

289
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.319
happy birthday.

290
00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:49.799
Mmm.

291
00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:52.170
Thanks.

292
00:17:52.359 --> 00:17:53.359
Mmm.

293
00:17:54.559 --> 00:17:55.839
Well...

294
00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.359
I'm throwing a party tonight.

295
00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:01.519
I'd like to invite you to come.

296
00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:04.410
Tonight?

297
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:07.650
I already have an appointment.

298
00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:09.680
Oh?

299
00:18:11.319 --> 00:18:13.920
I thought you said you were free?

300
00:18:14.599 --> 00:18:16.119
That was yesterday.

301
00:18:16.119 --> 00:18:17.839
I'm not free anymore.

302
00:18:18.519 --> 00:18:19.519
Mmm.

303
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.759
Okay.

304
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.440
Well, then.

305
00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.599
I have to get going.

306
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.240
I won't bother you anymore.

307
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.960
Wait.

308
00:18:57.599 --> 00:18:58.799
You forgot your bag.

309
00:19:05.279 --> 00:19:06.279
Thanks.

310
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.920
They say

311
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.960
when a woman

312
00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:13.359
gets one year older,

313
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.200
her face will wrinkle twice as fast.

314
00:19:20.519 --> 00:19:21.650
What on earth are you trying to say?

315
00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.839
Whoo!

316
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.799
Let's celebrate!

317
00:19:47.079 --> 00:19:49.359
Hello, Miss Rin.

318
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.799
Your costume is adorable.

319
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.650
Happy birthday.

320
00:19:53.039 --> 00:19:54.759
Thank you, Miss Mai.

321
00:19:54.759 --> 00:19:56.960
Your costume is adorable too.

322
00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.480
Just call me Mai.

323
00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:02.039
Then you can just call me Rin too.

324
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:04.650
Here you are.

325
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.119
Wow! Thank you!

326
00:20:08.119 --> 00:20:09.960
You didn't have to.

327
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.650
It's fine.
It's nothing much, really.

328
00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.410
It's a shame that Tan didn't come.

329
00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.119
Hmm.

330
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.359
That's true.

331
00:20:26.359 --> 00:20:28.839
I didn't mean anything by that.

332
00:20:28.839 --> 00:20:30.410
I didn't say anything.

333
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.650
I'll go join the rest of the party.

334
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.480
- Okay, please do.
- Have a good one.

335
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.720
Happy birthday, Rarin!

336
00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:07.319
Have a good one.

337
00:21:07.319 --> 00:21:09.279
A merry and happy one!

338
00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.759
Wow, that is one gorgeous costume.

339
00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:16.759
Thank you very much, Praew.

340
00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:19.119
Of course!

341
00:21:19.119 --> 00:21:20.650
It's your big day

342
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.559
so I had to go all in.

343
00:21:25.079 --> 00:21:26.720
If Porsche came,

344
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.319
I would have made him dress up
as the Mad Hatter.

345
00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:30.960
Too bad

346
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.440
he wouldn't come.

347
00:21:32.599 --> 00:21:34.170
I tried to make him.

348
00:21:34.279 --> 00:21:37.440
But he said he can't
face you right now.

349
00:21:39.119 --> 00:21:40.440
Anyway,

350
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.480
he got you a present.

351
00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:44.480
Gift!

352
00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.240
Thank you.

353
00:21:56.119 --> 00:21:57.200
Here you go.

354
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.480
Okay.

355
00:22:02.039 --> 00:22:03.039
Right.

356
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.079
Hold on! That's not all.

357
00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:07.799
Flowers!

358
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.319
- Uhh...
- This way!

359
00:22:16.599 --> 00:22:17.599
Thank you.

360
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.160
Okay.

361
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.519
Hold on! That's not it.

362
00:22:28.319 --> 00:22:29.680
Music!

363
00:23:15.599 --> 00:23:16.599
Wow.

364
00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.880
Thank you.

365
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.680
It's okay.

366
00:23:23.799 --> 00:23:26.480
Please thank Porsche for me too.

367
00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.279
I'll put the flowers away.

368
00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.599
Please enjoy the party.

369
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.920
I will.

370
00:23:36.799 --> 00:23:38.359
What is this? Why did you do that?

371
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.960
It's not your cue!

372
00:23:46.039 --> 00:23:48.079
It's nothing.

373
00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.960
I'll go and enjoy the party now.

374
00:23:52.319 --> 00:23:53.759
I've been looking forward to it!

375
00:23:53.759 --> 00:23:56.119
Hey! Everybody!

376
00:24:11.759 --> 00:24:13.559
You startled me.

377
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.799
You're here for the party, right?

378
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:24.160
Thank you for dressing up
for the occasion.

379
00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.920
Please go outside and enjoy
the food and drinks.

380
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.000
It's on the house.

381
00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:37.119
Oh, it might be a bit tricky for you

382
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.400
in that costume.

383
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.799
I'll take that off for you.

384
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.720
Tan!

385
00:25:05.559 --> 00:25:07.160
Rin!

386
00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.160
Can you please come outside?

387
00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.759
We're about to bring out the cake.

388
00:25:12.119 --> 00:25:13.119
Hey!

389
00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:15.039
Da!

390
00:25:15.039 --> 00:25:17.119
Why did you tell her that?
It's supposed to be a surprise!

391
00:25:17.119 --> 00:25:19.119
Really!

392
00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.839
Bye! I'll see you later!

393
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.640
See you!

394
00:25:41.839 --> 00:25:43.440
I thought you said
you weren't coming?

395
00:25:45.599 --> 00:25:48.200
I went to the house
to drop some stuff off.

396
00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:50.599
I got bored so I came over.

397
00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:57.720
Are you trying to sneak in
a present for Rarin?

398
00:25:58.519 --> 00:26:00.240
Huh? Huh?

399
00:26:00.359 --> 00:26:01.400
I'm not!

400
00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.599
Ugh! You reek!

401
00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:05.960
Ugh!

402
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.200
- What's wrong? You're drunk!
- What are you doing here?

403
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.920
Are you here to take me home?

404
00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.240
Are you going?

405
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.480
To where?

406
00:26:16.319 --> 00:26:19.559
- If you're not, then I'm going now.
- I'm going! I'm going!

407
00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:23.039
You didn't have to sit there
with that stern face.

408
00:26:23.319 --> 00:26:24.599
You're so hot-tempered.

409
00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:26.839
What's the hold-up? Come on!

410
00:26:26.839 --> 00:26:28.960
Now you're complaining even though
you've been sitting there for ages!

411
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.599
Wait!

412
00:26:34.519 --> 00:26:35.680
Be careful.

413
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.480
There.

414
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.680
Tan,

415
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:45.960
what you say doesn't align with
how you feel.

416
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.480
You said, "I'm not going."

417
00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.559
"I'm not going."

418
00:26:51.279 --> 00:26:52.279
And see?

419
00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.000
Just stop it.

420
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:58.559
You were sneaking in a present
for your crush.

421
00:26:58.759 --> 00:27:00.839
Do you think
you're still at university?

422
00:27:02.319 --> 00:27:04.519
Mai, stop mocking me.

423
00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.759
You dressed up so nicely

424
00:27:06.759 --> 00:27:08.119
but you wouldn't go in.

425
00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:19.240
This is unexpected.

426
00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.960
I thought you were going to

427
00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.519
dress up as a mascot.

428
00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:24.839
It's my business.

429
00:27:26.519 --> 00:27:27.599
Rin was sad

430
00:27:28.599 --> 00:27:31.119
that you didn't go.

431
00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:33.519
Really?

432
00:27:36.799 --> 00:27:38.839
She's sad?

433
00:27:41.519 --> 00:27:42.519
Mai?

434
00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:45.039
Mai?

435
00:28:09.839 --> 00:28:12.240
Thank you, Da and Jib.

436
00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:17.480
It's okay. No biggie.

437
00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:22.079
You can go home and rest now.

438
00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.559
Tomorrow, you can come in late.

439
00:28:29.759 --> 00:28:30.839
Thank you.

440
00:28:30.839 --> 00:28:33.720
We'll get going then.

441
00:28:34.519 --> 00:28:36.119
Okay.

442
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.680
Oh.

443
00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:40.920
Rin, can I borrow an umbrella?

444
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:42.960
An umbrella?

445
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.960
It's about to rain.

446
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:47.960
Of course.

447
00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:50.519
Let's go.

448
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.240
Bye.

449
00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:19.759
Where are you?

450
00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:22.160
Is the party over?

451
00:29:23.599 --> 00:29:25.039
I'm at the studio.

452
00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.519
Just tidying up.

453
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.160
Oh.

454
00:29:28.359 --> 00:29:31.759
Once you're done, hurry home.

455
00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:34.319
Mmm!

456
00:29:34.839 --> 00:29:38.200
By the way, where are you now?

457
00:29:38.759 --> 00:29:40.759
I'm at home.

458
00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:42.519
Why did you ask?

459
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.000
I was just wondering

460
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.519
about the party.

461
00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:50.039
I met someone who looked familiar.

462
00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.359
But they're wearing
a mascot costume.

463
00:29:53.759 --> 00:29:55.839
So I didn't know who they were.

464
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.720
That wasn't me.

465
00:30:04.519 --> 00:30:05.519
Hmm.

466
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.559
I didn't even say anything.

467
00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:12.480
Are you sure that you're at home?

468
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.720
Of course I am.

469
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.279
Do you want me to
send you a selfie telepathically?

470
00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:18.359
Huh.

471
00:30:18.359 --> 00:30:20.880
That's funny. How did you
come up with that?

472
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:28.759
I'm actually a comedian.

473
00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:34.359
Tan?

474
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.240
What?

475
00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.920
What are you doing here?

476
00:30:51.079 --> 00:30:52.160
Rin?

477
00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:55.240
I'm at home.

478
00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.839
You're mistaken.

479
00:30:57.079 --> 00:30:59.079
How can you be at home?

480
00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.319
You sneaked over here, didn't you?

481
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.839
Don't tell me that
the present inside

482
00:31:05.839 --> 00:31:07.200
isn't from you.

483
00:31:07.559 --> 00:31:10.119
Rin, you're joking, right?

484
00:31:11.079 --> 00:31:12.599
Who's with you now?

485
00:31:13.599 --> 00:31:16.759
You went all out with your costume.

486
00:31:17.759 --> 00:31:19.359
Stop fooling around already.

487
00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.960
Rin,

488
00:31:21.519 --> 00:31:22.920
I'm not fooling around.

489
00:31:23.559 --> 00:31:26.039
- Hurry up and call...
- Come on.

490
00:31:27.119 --> 00:31:30.759
Is it because we can hear
each other's voices in the rain?

491
00:31:31.039 --> 00:31:33.519
So you put on a disguise
to prank me?

492
00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.119
I know that it's you.

493
00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:39.559
Rin, listen to me.

494
00:31:39.559 --> 00:31:41.960
You're in danger. Do you know that?

495
00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.519
Tanthai,

496
00:31:44.079 --> 00:31:45.799
take off the headpiece.

497
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:49.119
I already know that it is you.

498
00:31:49.599 --> 00:31:51.880
Rin, listen to me carefully.

499
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.599
I did sneak in
to bring you a present.

500
00:31:54.599 --> 00:31:57.720
But I wasn't wearing
a mascot costume or anything.

501
00:32:00.279 --> 00:32:01.279
Rin!

502
00:32:02.039 --> 00:32:03.079
Rin!

503
00:32:03.759 --> 00:32:04.839
Rin!

504
00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.920
Tan.

505
00:32:13.599 --> 00:32:15.920
Rin!

506
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.440
Rin!

507
00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.160
Rin!

508
00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.359
Where are you, Rin?

509
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.160
Rin!

510
00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.079
Rin!

511
00:33:05.599 --> 00:33:07.359
Rin! Can you hear...

512
00:33:18.759 --> 00:33:21.480
(What is the voice in the rain?)

513
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.400
Rarin, where are you?

514
00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.839
Answer me!

515
00:33:40.079 --> 00:33:41.480
I'm here to help you!

516
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.000
Rin!

517
00:33:58.759 --> 00:33:59.920
Rin,

518
00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.279
if you can hear me, please answer.

519
00:34:05.359 --> 00:34:07.119
Where are you?

520
00:34:09.039 --> 00:34:10.480
Rin?

521
00:34:11.809 --> 00:34:13.519
I'm begging you.

522
00:34:14.199 --> 00:34:15.809
Answer me.

523
00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.840
Tan!

524
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:27.480
Rin!

525
00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.599
Can you hear me, Rin?

526
00:34:37.239 --> 00:34:38.239
Rin?

527
00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:39.840
It's me.

528
00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.239
Don't be afraid.

529
00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:44.960
Where are you?

530
00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:48.559
- Can you tell me?
- Help!

531
00:34:48.809 --> 00:34:52.960
- Help me!
- Help! I'm right here! Help me!

532
00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.119
Rin, listen to me.

533
00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.559
Don't be afraid.

534
00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.239
Just listen to my voice.

535
00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:06.079
Rin,

536
00:35:08.809 --> 00:35:10.199
you don't have to be afraid anymore.

537
00:35:11.159 --> 00:35:12.480
I'm right here.

538
00:35:25.239 --> 00:35:26.440
Tan?

539
00:35:27.769 --> 00:35:29.329
You can hear me now?

540
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:32.039
Tan!

541
00:35:34.199 --> 00:35:35.400
It's so dark

542
00:35:35.809 --> 00:35:38.480
and cramped in here!

543
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.039
Okay, okay.

544
00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.840
Rin.

545
00:35:47.809 --> 00:35:48.840
Now,

546
00:35:49.329 --> 00:35:51.480
I want you to look around slowly.

547
00:35:53.119 --> 00:35:56.719
See if there's anything close by

548
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.079
that can tell you where you are.

549
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.119
You're not hurt, are you?

550
00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:48.679
I'm not.

551
00:36:49.809 --> 00:36:51.039
Thank you.

552
00:36:53.769 --> 00:36:54.840
I'm so relieved.

553
00:36:56.119 --> 00:36:58.599
We're lucky that the sicko didn't
kidnap you and take you somewhere.

554
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:02.329
They just locked you up
inside the storeroom.

555
00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:05.920
Fortunately,

556
00:37:06.159 --> 00:37:08.329
I recognized that pile of fabric.

557
00:37:09.329 --> 00:37:11.360
So I knew where I was.

558
00:37:12.679 --> 00:37:13.880
And then I remembered

559
00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:16.329
what Da said.

560
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.679
Thank you, Da.

561
00:37:20.159 --> 00:37:22.769
Also, don't forget to tidy up

562
00:37:22.769 --> 00:37:24.480
so the place won't look messy
when the guests arrive.

563
00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:26.159
All done.

564
00:37:26.159 --> 00:37:28.000
I've put everything
in the storeroom.

565
00:37:28.199 --> 00:37:29.840
- I'll see you then.
- See you.

566
00:38:15.809 --> 00:38:16.880
Da?

567
00:38:18.679 --> 00:38:19.719
Jib?

568
00:38:22.679 --> 00:38:23.840
Da?

569
00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.719
Calm down. It's me.

570
00:38:51.679 --> 00:38:53.880
Rin, how are you feeling?

571
00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.719
I have a headache.

572
00:39:02.519 --> 00:39:04.239
Here. Take some medicine.

573
00:39:14.599 --> 00:39:15.769
Take this.

574
00:39:34.559 --> 00:39:36.119
Where is this place?

575
00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.239
Don't you remember?

576
00:39:39.519 --> 00:39:41.360
I brought you over to my house.

577
00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:51.329
Rin,

578
00:39:52.039 --> 00:39:54.679
do you know who the culprit is?

579
00:40:10.199 --> 00:40:11.599
Not a clue.

580
00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.639
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

581
00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.480
Why are you apologizing?

582
00:40:28.519 --> 00:40:29.639
Actually,

583
00:40:30.289 --> 00:40:31.880
someone sent
a threatening letter to me.

584
00:40:32.719 --> 00:40:34.639
It told me to stop
messing around with you.

585
00:40:38.119 --> 00:40:39.809
I should've warned you earlier.

586
00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.719
I underestimated them.

587
00:40:49.119 --> 00:40:50.679
But I'm fine now.

588
00:40:52.199 --> 00:40:53.809
Don't blame yourself.

589
00:40:54.769 --> 00:40:56.400
Anyway,

590
00:40:56.559 --> 00:40:59.329
I'll take better care of myself.

591
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.480
Let's do it this way.

592
00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.880
I'm going to file a police report

593
00:41:10.289 --> 00:41:12.000
even though
it wasn't life-threatening.

594
00:41:13.769 --> 00:41:15.769
You shouldn't be alone
in the meantime.

595
00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.920
I want you to come and stay here.

596
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.679
Here?

597
00:41:38.519 --> 00:41:39.840
At your place?

598
00:41:40.809 --> 00:41:41.809
Yes.

599
00:41:43.329 --> 00:41:44.840
It's not just me here.

600
00:41:45.809 --> 00:41:47.039
Mai is also here.

601
00:41:47.639 --> 00:41:49.599
Maybe she can
help look after you too.

602
00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:57.360
But the letter said...

603
00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.000
I still think that I should
take responsibility.

604
00:42:00.719 --> 00:42:01.719
Besides,

605
00:42:02.199 --> 00:42:05.769
I think the culprit wouldn't dare
to break-in when you're with me.

606
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.400
More importantly,

607
00:42:10.119 --> 00:42:11.599
I can rest assured

608
00:42:12.639 --> 00:42:14.079
knowing that you're close by.

609
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.920
Umm...

610
00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.519
Is that your present for me?

611
00:42:50.199 --> 00:42:51.199
Mmm.

612
00:43:01.289 --> 00:43:02.960
- Hold on.
- Hmm?

613
00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:06.360
You shouldn't unwrap it in front
of the person who gave it to you.

614
00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.639
Wow!

615
00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.199
It's so cute!

616
00:43:21.769 --> 00:43:22.840
But...

617
00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.239
why did you...

618
00:43:27.079 --> 00:43:29.289
buy me a no-rain doll?

619
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.559
A no-rain doll?

620
00:43:38.079 --> 00:43:40.960
I thought it was
a rain-summoning doll.

621
00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:52.400
You are

622
00:43:53.519 --> 00:43:54.519
ridiculous.

623
00:43:54.719 --> 00:43:55.719
Mmm.

624
00:43:58.079 --> 00:43:59.079
Strange.

625
00:44:00.719 --> 00:44:01.960
Thank you.

626
00:44:04.559 --> 00:44:06.119
Rin, how are you doing?

627
00:44:10.519 --> 00:44:12.280
I'm better now.

628
00:44:14.239 --> 00:44:16.239
I should go.

629
00:44:23.679 --> 00:44:25.639
Make yourself at home, okay?

630
00:44:25.639 --> 00:44:27.039
Just think of it as your home.

631
00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:28.960
Okay.

632
00:44:49.679 --> 00:44:53.400
(What is the voice in the rain?)

633
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.280
Hello?

634
00:45:03.599 --> 00:45:04.840
Who are you?

635
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.880
Hello?

636
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.519
Excuse me.

637
00:45:37.519 --> 00:45:40.760
Out of nowhere,
all of my work got plagiarized.

638
00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.639
Is this close enough

639
00:45:42.639 --> 00:45:44.079
to the prince you've envisioned?

640
00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:46.320
I've decided

641
00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:49.079
to propose to Rin.
