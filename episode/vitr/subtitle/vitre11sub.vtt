1
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.719
Rin?

2
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.090
Rin?

3
00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.960
Yes, Da?

4
00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:44.479
Why are you here so early?

5
00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:51.120
I wanted to get an early start.

6
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.479
Don't tell me you've been here
since last night.

7
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.280
And you haven't slept until now.

8
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.719
- That's right.
- You can't.

9
00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.439
If you're overworked,
it will take a toll on your health.

10
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.599
You should go home and rest.

11
00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.280
I'll take care of everything here.

12
00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:20.840
It's okay.

13
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.759
I'll take a quick nap

14
00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:26.840
and then I'll be able to work.

15
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.280
Okay.

16
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.719
Rung, do you remember me?

17
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.800
Mmm.

18
00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.879
Her memory hasn't
completely recovered.

19
00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:51.520
It might take a bit of time.

20
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.120
It's okay. I'll tell you. I'm...

21
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.960
Man?

22
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.919
We first met at a contest.

23
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.159
New Star Fashion Designer?

24
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.759
That's right.

25
00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:09.039
You remember when we first met?

26
00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.719
I remember you were very drunk
at the after-party.

27
00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.120
And you pole danced on the stage.

28
00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:17.439
There's no need to be so detailed.

29
00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:20.480
What about me? Do you remember me?

30
00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:25.399
Uhh...Joy?

31
00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:26.610
It's Jane!

32
00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:29.050
I'm kidding. Joy is your brother.

33
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.319
By the way, Rung.

34
00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:33.360
Are you going to come back to work
in the fashion industry again?

35
00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:37.759
I remember that you wanted to
have your own brand.

36
00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.199
I haven't thought about it.

37
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.240
Let me focus on
physical therapy first.

38
00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:50.439
It's okay. There's no need to rush.

39
00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:55.610
You're Kan's favorite.

40
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.170
You'll get better in no time.
Believe me.

41
00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:00.759
Kan?

42
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.439
You don't remember Kan?

43
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.319
Are you okay, Rung?

44
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.920
I have a mild headache.

45
00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.079
Oh, Tan.

46
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.079
This is Jane and Man.
They're my friends.

47
00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:29.319
Hello.

48
00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:30.959
Hello.

49
00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:33.199
You're much more handsome in person
than I thought you'd be.

50
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.120
With that body,
I'd like to dress you up.

51
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.199
But you're already Rarin's muse.

52
00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:41.800
What a shame.

53
00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.480
Not really.

54
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.279
If I have the chance, I hope
to collaborate with you.

55
00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:56.600
You're such a sweetie.

56
00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.600
Okay. Enough with the flirting.

57
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.079
We have to get going now.

58
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.199
Take care of yourself.

59
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.240
Bye.

60
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.560
Goodbye.

61
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.439
Are you okay?

62
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.600
I didn't get much sleep last night.

63
00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:24.079
I'll be okay after a nap.

64
00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:27.000
You should take a nap then.

65
00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:30.519
Okay.

66
00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:05.240
Ithijo tahang.
My heart yearns for you.

67
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.959
Our spirits mingle.

68
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:10.839
Nama hahang. Sathu. Sathu.

69
00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:14.959
Your body is mine.
Your heart is mine.

70
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.720
Take pleasure in my body.
Only fall for me.

71
00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:22.639
Love me. Be obsessed with me.

72
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.079
Love me. Be obsessed with me.

73
00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:26.839
Rin?

74
00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:50.480
Your suspicion about Sao,

75
00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:51.800
I think it's true.

76
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.279
Her behavior's been very weird,

77
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.839
especially with Tan.

78
00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.560
Has she done anything harmful
to Tan or Rung?

79
00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:03.160
I don't think so.

80
00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:06.519
But I don't trust her anymore.

81
00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:08.720
I'm thinking of hiring
a new caretaker.

82
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.680
I'm sorry, Mind.
I caused you trouble.

83
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.040
It's okay. I should thank you.

84
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.600
If you didn't tell me,
I wouldn't have noticed.

85
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.279
It's good

86
00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:25.560
to know now, so we can deal
with the problem in time.

87
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.600
Did you have a fight with Tan?

88
00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.039
Uhh...

89
00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.480
How do you know?

90
00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:53.039
I can tell it from your face.

91
00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.559
You can talk to me about anything.

92
00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:59.679
It's nothing much.

93
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.879
I just feel

94
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.639
that we're distancing ourselves.

95
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.799
Distancing?

96
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.330
Mmm.

97
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.639
Previously, no matter
how far apart we were,

98
00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:18.210
it would feel like we were
still close.

99
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.210
But now,

100
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.600
no matter how close we are,

101
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:27.120
I feel like we're even further away.

102
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.090
Rin.

103
00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:36.919
It's fine.
I'm probably overthinking.

104
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.720
I understand

105
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.450
the feeling

106
00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:48.279
of distancing

107
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.840
and being out of reach.

108
00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.330
Love is so complicated.

109
00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:09.960
Let's forget it
and not talk about it anymore.

110
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.879
We're having fun tonight.
Let's drink until we're drunk.

111
00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:14.279
We're not going home
if we're not drunk.

112
00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:17.840
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

113
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.210
Are you up?

114
00:10:55.679 --> 00:10:56.840
Oh, Rung.

115
00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.039
Are you okay? You seem strange.

116
00:11:07.759 --> 00:11:08.840
Nothing.

117
00:11:09.759 --> 00:11:11.240
I'm fine.

118
00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:16.639
Is it about Rin?

119
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.480
Is there something else?

120
00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:21.840
Nothing.

121
00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:24.679
It's just...

122
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.039
It's over between me and her.

123
00:11:47.799 --> 00:11:50.840
It's a pre-wedding shoot.
Why is the atmosphere so awful?

124
00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:52.399
It's the rainy season.

125
00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:56.399
Okay, bride and groom.
Stand close to each other.

126
00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:57.759
- Sure.
- Okay.

127
00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.679
Alright.

128
00:11:59.679 --> 00:12:02.519
Smile a little, sir.

129
00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:04.879
Big smile.

130
00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:07.440
Oh.

131
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.879
Okay. Put your head down a little.

132
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.240
Sir, put your arms around her.

133
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.960
- Do I have to?
- Yes, it's a pre-wedding shoot.

134
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.519
We want romantic photos.

135
00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.960
Okay. Put your cheeks
against each other.

136
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.120
- You've been in love for so long.
- I think it's too close.

137
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.559
What kind of lens are you using?

138
00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:26.039
It's a telephoto lens.

139
00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:30.559
Alright. Give the groom a bouquet.

140
00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.480
Sir,

141
00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.679
hand the bouquet over to her.

142
00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:41.320
It's a little stiff.

143
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.279
Can you look more lovey-dovey?

144
00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:46.080
Why are there so many
bossy people in my life?

145
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.159
Porsch.

146
00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:53.320
Embrace, smile, and laugh a little.

147
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.360
Or we can cancel today if you want,

148
00:12:56.879 --> 00:13:00.240
as long as you're not afraid of
your dad cutting you off again.

149
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.559
Okay. I was sleepy earlier
but I'm awake now.

150
00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:10.679
- Okay.
- What do you want?

151
00:13:10.679 --> 00:13:11.960
- Get closer.
- Get close.

152
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.759
Okay. Very sweet.
Look at each other.

153
00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:17.480
Look at each other.

154
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.600
Mind?

155
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.360
- Mind?
- Hmm? You called?

156
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.840
Is something wrong?

157
00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:30.720
Nothing's wrong.

158
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.360
Why? Do I look strange?

159
00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.039
No, we should go.

160
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.559
Hold on, Tan.

161
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.480
Can I come to work too?

162
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.639
Come to work with me?

163
00:13:50.919 --> 00:13:52.720
It's boring staying at home.

164
00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.960
Take me out to experience
something new.

165
00:13:57.679 --> 00:14:00.759
Is that a good idea?
Your body is still...

166
00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.039
I've gotten much stronger.
Don't worry.

167
00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:07.039
But

168
00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:09.919
I have a photoshoot with Rarin.

169
00:14:14.799 --> 00:14:16.039
I know.

170
00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:23.000
I'll wait in the car.

171
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.879
Are you sure?

172
00:14:37.759 --> 00:14:39.080
Do you remember

173
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.840
when I asked you who you'd choose

174
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.360
between me and Rarin?

175
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.360
I do.

176
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.840
- But I...
- I'm sorry.

177
00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.200
I put too big of a burden on you.

178
00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.000
I'm sorry.

179
00:15:05.799 --> 00:15:06.799
Rung...

180
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.600
I'd like to move on as well.

181
00:15:11.559 --> 00:15:13.200
But before I can do that,

182
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.799
I have to be sure of myself.

183
00:15:18.159 --> 00:15:19.360
Please let me come with you.

184
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.440
Okay.

185
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.240
But you have to get changed first.

186
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.320
You have to look pretty
when you go out.

187
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.159
Isn't this one pretty?

188
00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.399
You can be prettier.

189
00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:37.960
I'm reversing.

190
00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:42.639
Fabulous.

191
00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:44.399
Okay. Very good.

192
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.320
I'll go and get changed.

193
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.559
Wait for me here. I'll be back.

194
00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.960
Go on.

195
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.440
I'll wait for your transformation.

196
00:16:02.879 --> 00:16:03.879
Okay.

197
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.440
Look after her.

198
00:16:21.639 --> 00:16:24.480
Tan! What are you doing here?

199
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.639
Come on. You should get dressed
or you'll be late.

200
00:16:26.879 --> 00:16:27.879
Let's go.

201
00:16:29.679 --> 00:16:31.799
You'll get scolded if you're late.

202
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.080
Everyone looks so professional.

203
00:16:39.919 --> 00:16:41.840
Does Tan always work like this?

204
00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:43.200
Not always.

205
00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.600
This is Tan's big break.

206
00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.679
You've got makeup on
but why haven't you changed?

207
00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.759
I'm worried about Rung.

208
00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:55.120
So I dropped by to check up on her.

209
00:16:55.879 --> 00:16:57.200
Aww.

210
00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.559
Don't worry. She's with me.
You can trust me.

211
00:16:59.559 --> 00:17:01.320
See? I brought...

212
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.240
Huh?

213
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:09.440
I forgot her medication.

214
00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:11.079
You forgot her medication?

215
00:17:11.799 --> 00:17:13.279
You said I can trust you.

216
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.960
Sorry!

217
00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.410
I'll take a motorcycle taxi
back home right away! Okay?

218
00:17:20.559 --> 00:17:23.559
Stay with Tan. I won't be long.

219
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.170
That's beautiful.

220
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.319
Crop it smaller.

221
00:17:45.599 --> 00:17:48.200
This is Rung, my sister.

222
00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:51.359
She asked to come
and watch me work today.

223
00:17:52.079 --> 00:17:53.170
Okay.

224
00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:54.410
Hello.

225
00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.559
I'll try my best not to bother
all of you while you're working.

226
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.079
It's okay, Rung.

227
00:18:00.079 --> 00:18:01.720
You're so lovely.

228
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.119
You're definitely Tan's sister.

229
00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.000
Hello, Rung.

230
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.680
Tanthai,

231
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:20.119
don't worry.

232
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.240
We'll look after her.

233
00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.839
- That's right.
- Thank you.

234
00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:25.170
We'll look after her.

235
00:18:31.559 --> 00:18:33.079
Look at the outfit.

236
00:18:39.759 --> 00:18:41.039
You're not going to check my outfit?

237
00:18:57.039 --> 00:18:58.079
Face me.

238
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:16.079
I'm sorry for bringing Rung over
without telling you first.

239
00:19:24.519 --> 00:19:26.650
She just wanted to see me work.

240
00:19:29.079 --> 00:19:31.559
You can just focus on your work.

241
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:37.839
Don't worry.

242
00:20:14.839 --> 00:20:16.920
Shoot. Did I forget
to lock the door?

243
00:20:18.519 --> 00:20:21.200
Love me. Be obsessed with me.

244
00:20:22.359 --> 00:20:25.170
Love me. Be obsessed with me.

245
00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:28.759
Love me. Be obsessed with me.

246
00:20:29.319 --> 00:20:32.519
Love me. Be obsessed with me.

247
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.519
Your body is mine.
Your heart is mine.

248
00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:42.650
Take pleasure in my body.
Only fall for me.

249
00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:46.200
Love me. Be obsessed with me.

250
00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:49.960
Love me. Be obsessed with me.

251
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.890
Your body is mine.
Your heart is mine.

252
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.519
Take pleasure in my body.
Only fall for me.

253
00:20:58.839 --> 00:20:59.960
- Love me. Be obsessed with me.
- What are you doing?

254
00:21:01.839 --> 00:21:03.279
Nothing, Mind!

255
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:07.799
How is that nothing?
I saw it with my own eyes!

256
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.960
I trusted you!

257
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.599
And what are you doing in my house?

258
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.410
I-I just...

259
00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:18.480
I just love Tanthai.

260
00:21:18.599 --> 00:21:19.599
Love?

261
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.170
Do you call this love?

262
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.599
This is invading his privacy!

263
00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.680
Get out and don't come back again,

264
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.890
or I'll call the cops!

265
00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.000
No, you can't do that.

266
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.039
Please don't fire me.

267
00:21:35.279 --> 00:21:36.960
Let me stay here.

268
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.200
You dare to ask to stay?

269
00:21:41.359 --> 00:21:42.799
Lucky that Rin warned me.

270
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.480
Her again?

271
00:21:49.319 --> 00:21:50.359
Everything is her fault.

272
00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:52.079
Her fault and her fault only.

273
00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.519
What does Rin have to do with this?

274
00:21:55.079 --> 00:21:56.359
I won't forgive her.

275
00:21:58.039 --> 00:21:59.359
I won't forgive her.

276
00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.119
I won't forgive her.

277
00:22:01.599 --> 00:22:02.799
I won't forgive her.

278
00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.160
Sao!

279
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.440
Sao!

280
00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.359
Hello. I'm Kwan.

281
00:22:24.359 --> 00:22:26.680
I'm going to be
your interviewer today.

282
00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:30.359
- Please relax.
- Okay.

283
00:22:30.359 --> 00:22:31.440
Are you ready?

284
00:22:31.599 --> 00:22:33.400
Okay. We can start recording.

285
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.519
Let's get to the first question.

286
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.640
Rarin, can you explain
the concept of this collection?

287
00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:44.880
It's about human nature.

288
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.119
Because there is both good
and bad in one person.

289
00:22:49.359 --> 00:22:51.480
So I chose green

290
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.200
to symbolize mindfulness and nature.

291
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.519
Because nature is temporary.

292
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.119
As for the design,

293
00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.920
it's unisex.

294
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.480
Both women and men can wear it

295
00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.680
from head to toe.

296
00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.160
That's very interesting.

297
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:15.559
What about you, Tanthai?
How does it feel to be the muse?

298
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.680
I feel honored.

299
00:23:18.839 --> 00:23:21.359
Rarin is talented

300
00:23:21.359 --> 00:23:24.200
and passionate about fashion.

301
00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:27.519
As the model, I'd like to do my best

302
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.720
to present her outfit.

303
00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:33.480
So that people can see
her devotion.

304
00:23:40.039 --> 00:23:44.519
Rarin, how is it going
with Tanthai? Are you happy?

305
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.799
Very happy.

306
00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:49.799
He's easy to work with.

307
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.880
He's unique

308
00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:57.319
and always ready to improve himself.

309
00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.279
Initially,

310
00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.680
there was a bit of misunderstanding.

311
00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.440
After we got to know each other,

312
00:24:05.839 --> 00:24:08.839
I realized that he's a decent person

313
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.079
and very suitable

314
00:24:11.519 --> 00:24:14.079
to be the prince for our brand.

315
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:27.799
You're definitely the ideal
designer and model duo.

316
00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:29.440
It's very lovely.

317
00:24:30.359 --> 00:24:32.119
Okay. All done.

318
00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:35.400
All done. I'd like to end
the interview now.

319
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.799
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

320
00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:39.519
I'd like to take a photo
of you two together.

321
00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:41.799
Please stand up.

322
00:24:41.799 --> 00:24:42.799
Everyone,

323
00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.799
adjust the lighting
and put the chairs away.

324
00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:53.640
Stand close to each other.

325
00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.559
A little closer.

326
00:24:55.559 --> 00:24:57.000
Okay.

327
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.319
Okay. I'd like to continue
shooting the collection.

328
00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:41.359
Da, please take care of Tanthai.

329
00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:42.680
- Okay.
- I'm going to the bathroom.

330
00:25:55.319 --> 00:25:56.519
Rung?

331
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.240
Tan's outfit is really beautiful.

332
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.279
I think it really suits him.

333
00:26:10.039 --> 00:26:11.720
I'm sorry.

334
00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:13.799
What about?

335
00:26:14.799 --> 00:26:15.920
Well,

336
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.160
about the outfit that I...

337
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.440
Oh.

338
00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:24.559
It's in the past now.

339
00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.680
Initially,
I was very angry with you.

340
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.400
But after I saw you work,

341
00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.640
I know that you're talented.

342
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.079
Not really.
I'm still not good enough.

343
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:43.039
I'm a fellow designer.

344
00:26:43.319 --> 00:26:46.400
I can see your passion.

345
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.759
But my idea...

346
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:56.759
Hearing the idea through the rain?

347
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.680
Rung,

348
00:27:04.839 --> 00:27:06.359
you know about the voice?

349
00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:10.519
Tan told me everything.

350
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:17.319
And I think that you didn't mean it.

351
00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.240
But I'd like to ask you something
just to be sure.

352
00:27:38.079 --> 00:27:41.359
Are you sure
that you can make Tan happy?

353
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.640
If I get another chance,

354
00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.400
I promise

355
00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:03.440
I will make Tanthai happy.

356
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:08.359
I'm ready to do anything

357
00:28:08.559 --> 00:28:10.480
to make up for my mistake.

358
00:28:18.559 --> 00:28:20.799
I want you to love him sincerely.

359
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.440
You can't make up for anything.

360
00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.160
Some say love is like a weapon.

361
00:28:32.039 --> 00:28:35.519
Some say love is like
a protective shield.

362
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.720
If you're going to love Tan,

363
00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.720
I want you to love him sincerely.

364
00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.960
And not because you want
to make up for something.

365
00:28:46.839 --> 00:28:48.200
Can do you that?

366
00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:56.279
Yes.

367
00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:00.559
I will love

368
00:29:01.119 --> 00:29:03.359
and make Tan happy.

369
00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.759
Thank you.

370
00:29:10.119 --> 00:29:11.640
So I can rest assured.

371
00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:21.200
Come on. I'll keep going on my own.

372
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.039
What speed do you prefer?

373
00:29:24.279 --> 00:29:25.759
Make sure you can keep up, Rin.

374
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.839
Rung.

375
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.039
You left without me.

376
00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:34.200
Are we on time?

377
00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.480
We are.

378
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.599
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

379
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.799
I think the photos
will turn out great.

380
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.640
- Hello.
- Hello, Kan.

381
00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.920
- Promotional photoshoot?
- That's right.

382
00:29:53.079 --> 00:29:54.079
Great.

383
00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.880
Oh, you're Rung.

384
00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.160
Yes?

385
00:30:03.359 --> 00:30:04.920
You know her?

386
00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.400
Of course I do.

387
00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.640
Hello, Rung.

388
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.640
Do you remember me?

389
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.599
I...

390
00:30:18.759 --> 00:30:21.480
I don't really remember. I'm sorry.

391
00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.559
She used to be a student
at my school.

392
00:30:33.359 --> 00:30:34.799
Really?

393
00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:37.319
I used to be your student?

394
00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.359
That's right. And a very
talented one at that.

395
00:30:41.359 --> 00:30:43.480
I still feel that it was a shame.

396
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.440
Really?

397
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.160
Not bad at all.

398
00:30:48.839 --> 00:30:49.839
Thank you.

399
00:30:51.759 --> 00:30:52.880
Excuse me.

400
00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.559
What's wrong?

401
00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.200
I don't feel well.

402
00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:14.920
Tan, you should take her home.

403
00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:17.880
Okay.

404
00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.519
Let's go home, Rung.

405
00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.640
I don't know where Mind is.
It's been ages.

406
00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:29.759
- We should go as well.
- Okay.

407
00:31:31.559 --> 00:31:32.799
Rin,

408
00:31:33.039 --> 00:31:34.880
your car is over there.

409
00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:37.319
Oh, right.

410
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.359
I didn't park there.

411
00:31:41.359 --> 00:31:42.799
This way.

412
00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:48.119
Porsch, what are you doing here?

413
00:31:49.319 --> 00:31:51.519
I called but you didn't pick up.

414
00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.079
So I just came over.
Am I disturbing you?

415
00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.400
No.

416
00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.119
Is something the matter?

417
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.680
Are you done with work?

418
00:32:05.079 --> 00:32:07.160
If you are and don't need to
go anywhere else,

419
00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.400
I'd like to talk to you.

420
00:32:17.359 --> 00:32:18.359
Please.

421
00:32:22.759 --> 00:32:23.799
I'll get it.

422
00:32:24.759 --> 00:32:26.440
Here's your gyoza.

423
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.279
- Watch out. It's hot.
- Okay.

424
00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.960
Eat up.

425
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.559
I have something to tell you.

426
00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.880
Mmm?

427
00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:52.160
Uhh... I...

428
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.720
I'm about to get married.

429
00:32:58.039 --> 00:32:59.079
What?

430
00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.559
I'm about to marry the woman
my Dad chose for me.

431
00:33:04.079 --> 00:33:05.200
How come?

432
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.400
It's his condition in exchange
for something important.

433
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.640
Don't worry.

434
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.480
I just wanted to tell you

435
00:33:21.839 --> 00:33:22.960
that from this day forward,

436
00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.119
I won't be proposing to you anymore.

437
00:33:32.039 --> 00:33:35.039
But you're being forced.

438
00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.359
I have no choice.
I have to play along.

439
00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:42.920
One thing that's a shame.

440
00:33:43.759 --> 00:33:46.480
I won't get to wear a tuxedo
that you make for me.

441
00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.960
That's all.

442
00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.119
The bride's dealing with the rest.
She won't let me get involved.

443
00:33:51.759 --> 00:33:52.839
Can I ask you one thing?

444
00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.960
Mmm.

445
00:33:57.519 --> 00:33:58.839
Come to my wedding

446
00:33:58.839 --> 00:34:01.160
as a friend of the groom.

447
00:34:06.079 --> 00:34:07.119
We shook hands on it.

448
00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.960
Porsch!

449
00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:26.920
Huh?

450
00:34:28.159 --> 00:34:29.159
Tan!

451
00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.599
Where have you been?

452
00:34:35.559 --> 00:34:38.639
I called you so many times.
Why didn't you answer?

453
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.679
Where's Rin? Huh?

454
00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:43.239
We just parted ways.

455
00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:44.719
What's the matter?

456
00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:45.719
It's Sao.

457
00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.400
She's a stalker.

458
00:34:47.519 --> 00:34:50.159
She's the one who kidnapped Rin.

459
00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.809
Sao did that?

460
00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.920
I saw her at our house.

461
00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:56.920
She told me

462
00:34:57.769 --> 00:34:59.519
that everything is Rin's fault.

463
00:34:59.719 --> 00:35:01.329
I don't know what that means

464
00:35:01.329 --> 00:35:03.239
but I'm scared that
Rin might be in danger.

465
00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.289
Tan, you should go and see Rin.

466
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.360
We can catch a taxi home.

467
00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.639
- But...
- This is a big deal.

468
00:35:11.769 --> 00:35:13.480
Rin will be safer with you.

469
00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:15.329
Okay.

470
00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:26.289
I think it's about to rain.

471
00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:28.599
Huh?

472
00:35:31.079 --> 00:35:32.880
My phone.

473
00:35:34.199 --> 00:35:36.119
Jeez, Da probably has it.

474
00:35:36.329 --> 00:35:37.440
I'll give you a lift.

475
00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.239
What are you doing here?

476
00:36:05.289 --> 00:36:06.920
I want your power.

477
00:36:07.519 --> 00:36:08.559
Give it to me.

478
00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.679
What power?

479
00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.239
Don't pretend like you don't know.

480
00:36:13.809 --> 00:36:16.719
The power you use
to communicate with Tanthai.

481
00:36:17.719 --> 00:36:18.840
Give it to me.

482
00:36:21.039 --> 00:36:22.199
I can't.

483
00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.519
I knew that you'd say no.

484
00:36:28.199 --> 00:36:29.400
It's not that.

485
00:36:32.199 --> 00:36:33.639
Tanthai and I

486
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.119
can't communicate anymore.
The power's gone.

487
00:36:38.119 --> 00:36:39.239
Don't lie to me!

488
00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.880
I didn't!

489
00:36:42.039 --> 00:36:45.159
We can't hear each
other's voices anymore.

490
00:36:49.559 --> 00:36:50.639
Then,

491
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.679
I'm going to destroy
everything that's yours.

492
00:36:57.199 --> 00:36:59.400
Because you've taken
everything from me.

493
00:37:08.159 --> 00:37:09.960
Wait.

494
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.440
Hey, wait!

495
00:37:31.559 --> 00:37:32.559
Don't.

496
00:37:36.079 --> 00:37:37.079
Don't!

497
00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.960
Rin!

498
00:39:03.679 --> 00:39:05.400
Rin! Are you okay?

499
00:39:09.159 --> 00:39:10.159
Come on.

500
00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:11.719
Watch out, Rin.

501
00:39:17.159 --> 00:39:18.599
Careful. Careful.

502
00:39:24.159 --> 00:39:25.239
Tan...

503
00:39:25.239 --> 00:39:27.360
- Rin, are you hurt?
- Are you okay, Tan?

504
00:39:28.519 --> 00:39:30.119
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Tan.

505
00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.960
Tan,

506
00:39:37.079 --> 00:39:40.289
what should I do
to make you love me?

507
00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.440
I don't have feelings for you, Sao.

508
00:39:47.769 --> 00:39:49.480
It must be because of that power.

509
00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.289
That's why you're still
bonded to her.

510
00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.960
I'd like to know

511
00:39:54.289 --> 00:39:56.440
if I had that power,

512
00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.840
will you love me like you love her?

513
00:39:59.199 --> 00:40:01.599
Our power has been gone for ages.

514
00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.079
Even without it, I still love her.

515
00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.599
What about me?

516
00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.329
I love you too, Tanthai.

517
00:40:13.639 --> 00:40:15.400
I understand your feelings, Sao.

518
00:40:15.719 --> 00:40:17.679
But I can't accept it. I'm sorry.

519
00:40:18.289 --> 00:40:20.599
Rin, is there a fire extinguisher?

520
00:40:20.599 --> 00:40:22.199
There is. It's inside.

521
00:40:22.199 --> 00:40:24.639
I'll put out the fire.
Call the fire department.

522
00:40:24.769 --> 00:40:25.809
Wait here.

523
00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:27.559
Tan, be careful!

524
00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:29.039
You don't love me?

525
00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.960
Hello, is this the fire department?

526
00:40:34.719 --> 00:40:36.639
Yes, It's Petchaburi 38/1.

527
00:40:37.519 --> 00:40:38.769
Please hurry.

528
00:40:44.599 --> 00:40:46.679
I don't want to live anymore.

529
00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.519
What are you doing? Stop!

530
00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:56.119
Hey!

531
00:41:00.329 --> 00:41:02.769
I want to die. So?

532
00:41:03.719 --> 00:41:05.239
- Sao.
- There's nothing left for me.

533
00:41:07.079 --> 00:41:09.119
Sao, calm down!

534
00:41:53.289 --> 00:41:56.719
Have you gone insane?
Why do you want to die?

535
00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.519
It's none of your business!

536
00:42:00.639 --> 00:42:03.000
Of course.

537
00:42:04.119 --> 00:42:06.769
You've got everything
because of that stupid power!

538
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.440
You can say anything!

539
00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.480
You're a cheater!

540
00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:14.880
You didn't even have to try
as much as I did.

541
00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.039
But you got him!

542
00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.559
How do you know that I didn't try?

543
00:42:21.519 --> 00:42:23.559
With or without the power,

544
00:42:24.119 --> 00:42:27.119
it isn't easy
between me and Tanthai!

545
00:42:28.119 --> 00:42:29.440
You don't know

546
00:42:29.809 --> 00:42:33.440
how many times I've been hurt
because of our love!

547
00:42:36.039 --> 00:42:37.599
But guess what?

548
00:42:38.559 --> 00:42:40.119
I'm happy to be hurt.

549
00:42:43.199 --> 00:42:45.920
And I never ask for Tanthai

550
00:42:46.119 --> 00:42:48.199
to be responsible for my feelings.

551
00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.159
I really love Tanthai as well.

552
00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.719
I know.

553
00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.599
But you have to understand

554
00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.289
that love has to be
in exchange for love

555
00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:08.639
and not life.

556
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.440
Your life is worth something, Sao.

557
00:43:46.119 --> 00:43:48.280
Porsch disappeared from home.

558
00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:50.360
I get to live far away,

559
00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:51.599
do things myself,

560
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.599
and I'm going to be proud of it.

561
00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:56.320
I know Porsch doesn't
want to get married.

562
00:43:56.679 --> 00:43:57.679
Porsch,

563
00:43:58.119 --> 00:43:59.119
let's go.

564
00:44:01.719 --> 00:44:04.119
We've escaped this far,
and you're still overthinking?

565
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.920
We've been told to take him home.

566
00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.320
Run!

567
00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:11.639
We won't be able to escape reality.
