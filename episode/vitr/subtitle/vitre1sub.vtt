00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.840
The big news for this year's
rainy season is very exciting.

2
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.760
The Thai Meteorological
Department has reported that

3
00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:51.920
Nangmaew Typhoon will return
for the first time in 20 years.

4
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.640
It will be the longest
rainy season on record.

5
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.599
Please be mindful of both
your physical and mental health.

6
00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.400
My name is Rarin.

7
00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:10.090
I'm a fashion designer.

8
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.560
And I'm...

9
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.479
I'm so sorry!

10
00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:15.599
Are you okay?

11
00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.919
What's up with him?
Such a strange guy.

12
00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.370
The chest is 40, shoulders are...

13
00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.240
Check the hair too.

14
00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.319
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

15
00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.599
That's right, Da. But I've already
checked it once.

16
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.319
Do it again.

17
00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:24.680
- Okay.
- No excuses.

18
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.360
Do it three times. Understand?

19
00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.680
I do. Okay.

20
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.080
Excuse me?

21
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.039
Call me Da.

22
00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:32.840
Okay, Da.

23
00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.360
- Well...
- Are you an intern?

24
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.400
- That's right.
- What's up? I'm busy.

25
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.039
Well, this...

26
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.039
Alright. Let's talk later.

27
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.840
Over there, quiet down a bit
or the guests might hear you.

28
00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:46.800
Da.

29
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.639
Are you going to speak or not?

30
00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:51.120
And what's going on
with the top in your hand?

31
00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.360
Do you remember the costume
that you told me to check up on?

32
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.319
Isn't the model
done getting dressed?

33
00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.879
No, she's done. But...

34
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.479
But what?

35
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.560
There's a small mascara stain.

36
00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.360
This isn't small.

37
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.680
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

38
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.170
I was busy and I just saw it.

39
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.360
So I thought...

40
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.480
So you thought what?

41
00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.800
Can we use a shoulder bag
to cover it up?

42
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.959
Or maybe let her walk
with her hands in her pockets.

43
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.319
Has Rin arrived yet?

44
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.480
Probably not.

45
00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:49.360
"Probably"? "I think"?

46
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.610
Stop with the opinions
and be attentive.

47
00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.920
If you were, this mistake
wouldn't have happened.

48
00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:57.519
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.050
What's the matter?

50
00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:02.079
Uh...

51
00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:03.920
Hello, Rarin.

52
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.120
Next.

53
00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:09.519
Up.

54
00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:12.120
Don't forget the blocking.

55
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.680
Check the set again.

56
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.800
Everyone.

57
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.079
Okay.

58
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.800
Good morning.

59
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.879
Together, we've put in 160 hours
of work. This is going to be great.

60
00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.800
I'd like to thank you all.
Let's do this together.

61
00:05:25.959 --> 00:05:27.920
- Okay, Ms. Rarin.
- Okay, Ms. Rarin.

62
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.040
Thank you.

63
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.160
How much time do we have left?

64
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.279
Fifteen minutes.

65
00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:36.319
Apart from this one,
are others ready?

66
00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.480
- You...
- It's Jib.

67
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.959
Attention to detail is very
important in our line of work.

68
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.279
Please don't let this happen again.

69
00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.360
I'm really sorry.

70
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.079
It's okay.

71
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.000
Problems are meant to be solved.

72
00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:51.519
I'll handle this myself.

73
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.240
How is Ms. Anya doing?

74
00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:58.240
She came here all the way,

75
00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:00.920
but she hasn't reacted at all.

76
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.040
Why are you so anxious today, Rarin?

77
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.680
You really don't know?

78
00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:10.560
Ms. Anya is a national columnist.

79
00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:13.560
She can decide the fate
of a new brand

80
00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:15.720
just by writing up a piece
of criticism.

81
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.519
If she likes it,
then it's good news for us.

82
00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:20.120
But if she doesn't...

83
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.480
We'll be ruined, right?

84
00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:26.040
Get back to work. Go.

85
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.279
As I've said,

86
00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:56.800
this collection is a mix between
minimalism and masculinity.

87
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.040
When you see it, you'll know
immediately it's my work.

88
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.800
Can you tell us your inspiration?

89
00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:15.160
Ms. Rarin?

90
00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:18.279
Yes?

91
00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:21.360
Oh, my inspiration?

92
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.720
Well,

93
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.040
I get inspiration

94
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.959
from reading,
taking a stroll outside,

95
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.639
and observing my surroundings.

96
00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:38.679
I also listen to the sound of...

97
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.559
What's up with him?
Such a strange guy.

98
00:09:03.759 --> 00:09:06.879
That silly girl. She's so clumsy.

99
00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.120
Are you going to make me a suit?

100
00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:20.240
No, I'm not making you a suit.

101
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.919
My name is Rarin.

102
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.879
I'm a fashion designer.

103
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:30.240
And I have a special power.

104
00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:33.450
Whenever it rains,

105
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.360
I hear someone's voice.

106
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.090
He's always been my inspiration.

107
00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:41.279
And I call him

108
00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:42.919
"Prince."

109
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.519
I'm sorry!

110
00:11:11.919 --> 00:11:13.559
Are you okay?

111
00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:31.440
That silly girl. She's so clumsy.

112
00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.360
(Frozen to the core)

113
00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:04.039
This liquid cleanser

114
00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:07.000
can be used to wipe off
your makeup completely.

115
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.279
There are no irritants

116
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.919
and it cleans well.

117
00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.960
Your skin will be clean

118
00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:18.840
and glowing already.

119
00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:25.320
Your facial skin will be
relaxed as if it's in Bali.

120
00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:28.720
Monaki Cleansing Water.

121
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.480
Purely perfect cleansing essence.

122
00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:37.639
No need to wait for your next life
for clear, smooth skin.

123
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.559
That's it.

124
00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:40.799
Come on. Let's record it.

125
00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.679
- This is a live video.
- What?

126
00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:46.639
It's live?

127
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.039
Really?

128
00:12:50.879 --> 00:12:53.080
My name is Tanthai.

129
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.440
I'm a model and an actor.

130
00:12:56.639 --> 00:13:00.440
I became famous
unexpectedly overnight.

131
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.879
(My skin is clear because of #Dead
panCleansing #Tanthai #GreatPromo)

132
00:13:05.759 --> 00:13:11.799
(Girls are clamoring for Tanthai,
the deadpan idol)

133
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.960
But success is like fashion.

134
00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:20.440
Because this too shall pass.

135
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.559
What do you think about people
saying you'd make a good actor?

136
00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:25.639
Who said that?

137
00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:28.519
A lot of netizens are saying that.

138
00:13:28.519 --> 00:13:30.080
Can you answer
the questions one by one?

139
00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.039
It was almost my fall from grace.

140
00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.720
People even nicknamed me

141
00:13:35.039 --> 00:13:36.960
"The Scarecrow."

142
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.080
(Rumor! The Scarecrow fled the
reporters to see his sweetheart.)

143
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.759
I've gone through the entire
cheat sheet of being a celebrity.

144
00:13:53.799 --> 00:13:55.320
Cut. It's good.

145
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.240
Okay. It's all good.

146
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.200
Should we continue?

147
00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:01.559
Energetic?

148
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.759
Exaggerate it.

149
00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:05.679
- Okay. Do it for me.
- Alright.

150
00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:08.600
Excuse me, Tan.

151
00:14:08.759 --> 00:14:10.279
It was okay just now.

152
00:14:10.279 --> 00:14:12.679
But can you give it another go?
Be energetic this time.

153
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.600
Move over. I'll show you.

154
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.840
Men's Care Cool Max!
Frozen to the core!

155
00:14:19.039 --> 00:14:20.120
Like that.

156
00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.320
Isn't that a little over the top?

157
00:14:24.799 --> 00:14:27.159
I understand.

158
00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:31.480
But let's give them more
options for editing.

159
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:33.919
Who do you mean "them?"

160
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.679
The client.

161
00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:38.960
The client?

162
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.799
Keep it down, please.
It's the client.

163
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.799
Just try it, okay?

164
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.120
Just a moment.

165
00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.960
- I'll talk to him.
- I can't do it.

166
00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.559
You have to.

167
00:14:57.559 --> 00:14:59.639
You can do it. You have to.

168
00:14:59.639 --> 00:15:00.799
I can't do it.

169
00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:02.679
- Tan, are you ready?
- He's so ready!

170
00:15:02.679 --> 00:15:05.519
Okay. Get ready, Team!

171
00:15:05.519 --> 00:15:07.919
Alright. Let's shoot.

172
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.039
So we'll finally be able to go home.

173
00:15:10.039 --> 00:15:11.679
- Sound!
- Ready.

174
00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:13.320
- Camera!
- All good.

175
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.399
Take 29.

176
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.480
Okay. Ready?

177
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.960
Three, two... and action!

178
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.759
Use it because I do too!

179
00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:25.559
Men's Care Cool Max!
Frozen to the core!

180
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.159
Cut! Awesome!

181
00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:31.960
It's for real this time!

182
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:33.919
Cameraperson,
a little bit more. 2A, okay?

183
00:15:33.919 --> 00:15:36.039
Okay. Get ready.

184
00:15:36.039 --> 00:15:37.559
Let's get ready.

185
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.080
To the core.

186
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.559
Oh, Mr. Tan.

187
00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:48.519
Please flip Ms. Rung over again
at around 11 p.m.

188
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.240
This world is so unfair.

189
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.759
A dreamer like you had to
become a vegetable like this.

190
00:17:49.079 --> 00:17:50.170
Look at me.

191
00:17:50.759 --> 00:17:52.319
I don't have any dreams

192
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.519
or any talents.

193
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.680
- If I could choose...
- The dishes or the trash?

194
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:08.039
I'll do the dishes then.

195
00:18:08.039 --> 00:18:10.799
Come on! Take out the trash!
I want to take a shower!

196
00:18:14.119 --> 00:18:15.720
Mai.

197
00:18:16.519 --> 00:18:19.839
If you're going to live at someone
else's place, be considerate.

198
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.410
If you're not going to call
me "Miss Mai,"

199
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.319
at least be polite to someone who's
helping you take care of Rung.

200
00:18:28.319 --> 00:18:31.759
Okay. I know, Miss Mai.

201
00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.680
Gosh. That gave me goosebumps.
Just call me Mai.

202
00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:38.519
There's another movie role for you.

203
00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.480
- Toodles!
- Did you sell me again?

204
00:18:40.759 --> 00:18:42.680
Mai! Mai!

205
00:18:44.799 --> 00:18:45.890
Hey,

206
00:18:46.039 --> 00:18:49.000
did you forget what you told me
when you're were still a newcomer?

207
00:18:49.759 --> 00:18:52.170
Didn't you say you wanted me to
manage everything for you?

208
00:18:54.279 --> 00:18:55.519
I remember, but...

209
00:18:55.519 --> 00:18:57.170
But...

210
00:18:57.319 --> 00:19:00.559
I screen all of your jobs first.
Don't worry.

211
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.319
Your job is to earn money
and take care of Rung.

212
00:19:20.519 --> 00:19:22.079
You're on the rise right now.

213
00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.960
Take whatever you can get.

214
00:19:24.759 --> 00:19:27.519
Once you've got enough money
you can do whatever you want.

215
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:31.480
For now, you...

216
00:19:32.799 --> 00:19:35.559
we don't have much of a choice.

217
00:19:36.079 --> 00:19:37.170
Okay?

218
00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:40.680
Fine.

219
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.319
Get up early tomorrow. We have to
get you a new suit for an event.

220
00:19:49.759 --> 00:19:51.039
What event now?

221
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.559
Mai?

222
00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.519
Hello, Da?

223
00:20:17.799 --> 00:20:18.890
Rin,

224
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.240
we've been invited to Gorgeous'
"Thank You Gala."

225
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:28.839
Gorgeous' "Thank You Gala,"

226
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.319
right?

227
00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:34.039
That's right. They just called
to say

228
00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:38.039
it was Ms. Anya who suggested
that Gorgeous invite us.

229
00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:42.200
Really, Da?

230
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.680
Thank you!

231
00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:50.480
Yes!

232
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.240
My name is Tanthai.

233
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.079
I'm a model and an actor

234
00:20:55.319 --> 00:20:56.680
out of necessity.

235
00:20:58.079 --> 00:20:59.599
And I have a special power.

236
00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:01.960
Whenever it rains,

237
00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.240
I can hear a woman's voice.

238
00:21:11.359 --> 00:21:12.759
It's the voice

239
00:21:13.599 --> 00:21:14.720
that I hate the most.

240
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.960
The entire event will be catered.

241
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.799
As for today, I'd like to thank

242
00:22:00.079 --> 00:22:04.559
all of the famous designers and
brands that have gathered here.

243
00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:19.160
Rin, look!

244
00:22:19.759 --> 00:22:21.359
That's the owner of Laichan!

245
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.920
That's the CEO of Spring-Winter!

246
00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:30.559
Wow!

247
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.519
That's Sun Eagle!

248
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.960
Over there is...

249
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.039
Da,

250
00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.680
calm down.

251
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.240
We're here as designers as well.

252
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.759
Compose yourself.

253
00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.279
Okay. I'm sorry.

254
00:22:45.559 --> 00:22:47.960
Have you seen Ms. Anya?

255
00:22:48.279 --> 00:22:50.839
I'd like to thank her.

256
00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.599
She said she's going to announce
something on stage.

257
00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.799
Kan, hello.

258
00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:01.160
Hello. She's probably backstage.

259
00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.160
You're Rarin, right?

260
00:23:04.359 --> 00:23:05.440
Yes, I am.

261
00:23:06.279 --> 00:23:07.960
Do you know me?

262
00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.440
That's a strange question.

263
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:10.799
Of course, I do.

264
00:23:11.079 --> 00:23:12.559
Your brand is a dark horse.

265
00:23:12.759 --> 00:23:15.039
It's a masculine-princess concept

266
00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:18.839
that is ready to wear and accessible
to the majority of women.

267
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.680
You're talented.

268
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.519
Thank you very much.

269
00:23:22.519 --> 00:23:24.920
I'm also a fan of Queen Krishna.

270
00:23:25.079 --> 00:23:29.559
I aspire to be as successful as you.

271
00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.680
Is the princess hoping
to become a queen?

272
00:23:39.759 --> 00:23:41.759
I'm only joking.

273
00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:43.799
What I want to say

274
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.440
is that a newcomer brand like yours

275
00:23:48.079 --> 00:23:49.200
has to fight for it.

276
00:23:53.279 --> 00:23:54.359
Cheers.

277
00:23:58.359 --> 00:24:00.000
Next,

278
00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.720
I'd like to invite Ms. Anya up
to say a few words.

279
00:24:11.839 --> 00:24:14.599
Thank you, Gorgeous Thailand,

280
00:24:14.599 --> 00:24:17.039
for giving me the honor to come up
here to say a few words

281
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.720
at this cozy event.

282
00:24:20.319 --> 00:24:23.880
I've been in the fashion business
for almost 30 years.

283
00:24:24.799 --> 00:24:26.960
I've seen new brands being created

284
00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.440
and old brands being shut down.

285
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.480
The fashion business is a circle.

286
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.200
The new ones are born,
and the old ones die.

287
00:24:35.319 --> 00:24:37.079
It is an infinite loop.

288
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.119
I'm proud to be a part
of this circle,

289
00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:45.440
helping to advance
the fashion industry.

290
00:24:46.839 --> 00:24:50.839
In my opinion, Thai fashion
has come so far.

291
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.119
The new generation is very talented.

292
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.680
And the older generation continues
to maintain their quality,

293
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.920
making those
who wear their clothes happy.

294
00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.400
So, together with Gorgeous,

295
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.440
we came up with this event
to thank all of the brands.

296
00:25:09.839 --> 00:25:11.640
Hence, this event was born.

297
00:25:15.079 --> 00:25:17.240
Don't stop creating.

298
00:25:17.519 --> 00:25:19.720
Don't be afraid to keep sewing.

299
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.359
Every inch of fabric
is waiting for you.

300
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.920
Both new and old designers

301
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.960
can create beautiful

302
00:25:28.079 --> 00:25:29.759
and meaningful masterpieces.

303
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.599
Don't stop making Thai people
proud when they get dressed.

304
00:25:35.839 --> 00:25:37.240
Thank you very much.

305
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.720
She's definitely
our country's top columnist.

306
00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:44.440
Da,

307
00:25:45.759 --> 00:25:48.000
I've made a decision.

308
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.720
I will improve my brand even more.

309
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.000
Okay. I'm with you.

310
00:25:54.559 --> 00:25:55.759
We're in this together.

311
00:25:57.799 --> 00:25:58.960
Thank you.

312
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.440
Aren't you going
to talk to Ms. Anya?

313
00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.640
I completely forgot.

314
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:06.680
I will go and thank her.
I'll be right back.

315
00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.759
Oops.

316
00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:11.359
I forgot.

317
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.160
Okay. I'm at the walkway.

318
00:26:44.279 --> 00:26:46.440
Alright. I'll hurry up.

319
00:27:07.839 --> 00:27:10.680
Hey, hey.

320
00:27:10.799 --> 00:27:12.960
- Stay still.
- Move out of the way.

321
00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.119
It's stuck! It's stuck!

322
00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:20.640
Stay still!

323
00:27:20.759 --> 00:27:23.319
Don't move or it'll get ripped!

324
00:27:28.599 --> 00:27:29.759
I'm so sorry!

325
00:27:36.519 --> 00:27:38.640
Let me take care of it! Take it off!

326
00:27:39.079 --> 00:27:40.559
- It's okay.
- Take it off.

327
00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:42.200
Hey! Take it off.

328
00:27:42.359 --> 00:27:43.720
Right now?

329
00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:45.640
Hold on! Wait!

330
00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.839
What am I going to wear?

331
00:27:46.839 --> 00:27:48.200
I'll fix it!

332
00:27:49.359 --> 00:27:50.440
Hey!

333
00:27:59.039 --> 00:28:00.279
Ms. Anya!

334
00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.559
I...

335
00:28:07.279 --> 00:28:09.160
I'd like to...

336
00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.839
I'd like to know

337
00:28:23.359 --> 00:28:26.000
why you didn't react
at all that day.

338
00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.720
What day? Have we met?

339
00:28:33.319 --> 00:28:34.480
Well,

340
00:28:35.319 --> 00:28:38.119
the day that Rarin showcased
its new collection.

341
00:28:38.839 --> 00:28:40.240
You came.

342
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.759
But

343
00:28:42.799 --> 00:28:44.759
you didn't seem to react
at all to it.

344
00:28:45.799 --> 00:28:47.480
I'd like some feedback on

345
00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.880
whether you liked or hated it.

346
00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.880
But that day, you seemed

347
00:28:53.759 --> 00:28:55.319
so indifferent.

348
00:28:57.599 --> 00:28:59.240
Oh!

349
00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.200
That set?

350
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:03.839
Well,

351
00:29:05.559 --> 00:29:07.480
when it comes to clothing,

352
00:29:07.799 --> 00:29:09.680
sometimes flesh and blood are needed

353
00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:12.880
more than aesthetics

354
00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.400
or complex patterns.

355
00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.079
Clothing is like humans.

356
00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:20.200
It deserves its own life.

357
00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:25.920
So why should I react
to that lame showcase?

358
00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.960
Pardon?

359
00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:43.559
I don't think I wasn't clear.

360
00:29:44.799 --> 00:29:46.880
Keep trying,

361
00:29:48.079 --> 00:29:49.400
newcomer.

362
00:29:50.519 --> 00:29:51.759
It's Rarin!

363
00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:59.400
My brand. R-A-R-I-N.

364
00:30:02.039 --> 00:30:03.240
And one day,

365
00:30:03.839 --> 00:30:06.880
I'll make you mention

366
00:30:07.119 --> 00:30:08.319
and compliment it.

367
00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:14.000
I'll make it memorable.

368
00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.279
You're so enthusiastic!

369
00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:21.920
I look forward to that, Rarin.

370
00:30:32.839 --> 00:30:35.880
Why were you so irresponsible?
Do you know how expensive this was?

371
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.720
Hello?

372
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:40.960
Hello?

373
00:30:41.759 --> 00:30:42.839
Hey!

374
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.799
Come again?

375
00:30:47.559 --> 00:30:49.119
You weren't listening, were you?

376
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.480
I said it's expensive!
It's thousands of dollars!

377
00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:56.279
I've invested so much in you!

378
00:30:56.519 --> 00:30:58.599
And why didn't you...

379
00:31:00.279 --> 00:31:03.119
She just took it.
What else could I do?

380
00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.799
She who?

381
00:31:08.559 --> 00:31:10.319
Describe her.

382
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:23.640
Clothing is like humans.

383
00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.759
It deserves its own life.

384
00:31:26.079 --> 00:31:30.279
So why should I react
to that lame showcase?

385
00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:33.799
Ms. Primrose is here. Do you want to
do the fitting right away?

386
00:31:35.759 --> 00:31:36.839
Okay.

387
00:31:45.559 --> 00:31:46.640
Wait!

388
00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.720
What now?

389
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.400
Don't cause any trouble.

390
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.480
We're going in for the jacket
and then will hurry back out.

391
00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.559
Don't stop by to chat with anyone
or walk off alone, understand?

392
00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.240
We have a fitting at LMAO.

393
00:31:59.559 --> 00:32:02.960
So that you have something to wear
to Siam Film Awards, understand?

394
00:32:04.119 --> 00:32:05.200
Okay?

395
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:08.319
Fine.

396
00:32:10.319 --> 00:32:11.559
Can I really trust you?

397
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.519
Get inside.

398
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.440
- Hello.
- Hello.

399
00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.720
Welcome to Rarin's Couture.

400
00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.480
Hi, well...

401
00:32:55.759 --> 00:32:57.960
- Hey, Peachy!
- Mai!

402
00:32:58.519 --> 00:33:00.680
Hello! Are you here
for a fitting as well?

403
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.359
No, I'm only here
for a jack... jacket.

404
00:33:03.559 --> 00:33:06.079
- Are you here for a fitting?
- That's right.

405
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.720
Tan, how are you doing?

406
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.799
Hello.

407
00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:17.640
I'll be back. I have to go
to the bathroom.

408
00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.640
The bathroom's that way.

409
00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:22.960
- Be quick.
- Okay.

410
00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.920
- Is Ms. Rarin here?
- She is.

411
00:33:27.079 --> 00:33:29.799
- Do you have an appointment?
- I don't.

412
00:33:29.799 --> 00:33:32.039
I'll go and check for you.

413
00:33:32.039 --> 00:33:33.759
- Okay.
- Thank you.

414
00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:38.039
We haven't seen each other in ages.

415
00:33:38.039 --> 00:33:40.559
That's true. But we'll
see each often from now on.

416
00:33:42.759 --> 00:33:45.200
You're so beautiful!

417
00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:49.880
Hey, the suit jacket.

418
00:34:51.119 --> 00:34:52.199
Oh?

419
00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:55.079
The Jacket-Ripper.

420
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.289
How can you come in here
without permission?

421
00:35:00.329 --> 00:35:01.519
I didn't mean to.

422
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.360
I just...

423
00:35:05.599 --> 00:35:07.079
Did you design this?

424
00:35:14.559 --> 00:35:18.329
That's from Rarin's
opening collection.

425
00:35:19.119 --> 00:35:22.519
It has brought in a lot of business.
It sold out on the first day.

426
00:35:22.639 --> 00:35:25.159
We didn't restock either.

427
00:35:26.679 --> 00:35:28.360
But don't touch her.

428
00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:30.400
Her?

429
00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.079
You called the dress "her?"

430
00:35:37.769 --> 00:35:38.960
That's unbelievable.

431
00:35:39.719 --> 00:35:44.199
It's unbelievable that
it sold out on the first day?

432
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.920
It's unbelievable

433
00:35:46.719 --> 00:35:48.840
that you were able to design a dress

434
00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:53.639
that beautiful.

435
00:35:56.719 --> 00:35:58.039
Please leave.

436
00:35:58.039 --> 00:36:01.039
This is a workspace.
Don't make me kick you out.

437
00:36:02.809 --> 00:36:04.289
- Please leave.
- Tan!

438
00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.199
Why are you here? I told you
not to cause any trouble.

439
00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:09.480
I'm not!

440
00:36:10.159 --> 00:36:12.920
Ms. Rarin,
on behalf of him, I'm sorry.

441
00:36:15.039 --> 00:36:16.239
- Come on.
- What?

442
00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.079
- Get out?
- To where?

443
00:36:18.079 --> 00:36:20.840
Wherever. Didn't you want to
go to the bathroom?

444
00:36:25.039 --> 00:36:27.079
By the way,

445
00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.920
why are you here?

446
00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.199
We're here to pick up his jacket.

447
00:36:31.769 --> 00:36:34.480
You kept it for Tan, right?

448
00:36:34.639 --> 00:36:36.039
The one he forgot?

449
00:36:36.809 --> 00:36:37.880
Oh.

450
00:36:39.809 --> 00:36:40.880
That's right.

451
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.000
Thank you.

452
00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.599
Oh, well...

453
00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.039
I can't return this yet.

454
00:36:57.199 --> 00:36:58.360
Why not?

455
00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.599
I haven't fixed it yet.

456
00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:02.920
It's okay.

457
00:37:03.119 --> 00:37:05.159
- I have to.
- It's okay.

458
00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:07.159
I might be making a fuss.

459
00:37:07.159 --> 00:37:09.960
But I can't let this go.

460
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.329
It really is okay!

461
00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:13.440
No, it's not! Miss...

462
00:37:13.559 --> 00:37:15.639
It's Ms. Mai.

463
00:37:15.639 --> 00:37:16.920
- Ms. Mai!
- Ms. Rin!

464
00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.079
- Ms. Mai!
- Ms. Rin!

465
00:37:18.079 --> 00:37:20.079
- Mai...
- Oh!

466
00:37:31.329 --> 00:37:33.599
I'm really sorry.

467
00:37:35.039 --> 00:37:38.119
Please let me take responsibility

468
00:37:38.719 --> 00:37:41.360
and make you a new jacket.

469
00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.199
Do whatever you want.

470
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.289
But please hurry.
I have another fitting to go to.

471
00:37:50.119 --> 00:37:51.199
Okay.

472
00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:54.920
Please take off your jacket then.

473
00:37:56.639 --> 00:37:57.769
Do I have to?

474
00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.519
Yes.

475
00:37:59.519 --> 00:38:04.079
I like to take detailed
measurements for accuracy.

476
00:38:08.679 --> 00:38:12.199
Da, please start to a new page

477
00:38:12.199 --> 00:38:14.159
and write down as "Mr. Tanthai."

478
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.480
Okay.

479
00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.400
That's right and

480
00:38:18.679 --> 00:38:21.039
help me write it down.

481
00:38:22.809 --> 00:38:24.440
Hey, what are you doing!?

482
00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:28.159
You said you were going to take
detailed measurements?

483
00:38:30.559 --> 00:38:32.639
Just your jacket.

484
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.199
Please stand up straight.

485
00:38:47.119 --> 00:38:49.079
Okay?

486
00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:51.960
Okay.

487
00:38:52.119 --> 00:38:53.400
Raise your arms.

488
00:38:56.559 --> 00:38:57.719
Just this much.

489
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.559
Chest

490
00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.679
is 40.

491
00:39:18.809 --> 00:39:19.880
Do this.

492
00:39:27.559 --> 00:39:28.880
Upper arm

493
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.239
is 15.

494
00:39:36.239 --> 00:39:39.440
Arm length is 16.5.

495
00:39:39.769 --> 00:39:40.840
Overlap

496
00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.039
is 28.5.

497
00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.119
Seven.

498
00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.440
Shoulders

499
00:39:54.159 --> 00:39:55.639
are 17.5.

500
00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.639
Front shoulder

501
00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.039
is 16.5.

502
00:40:21.239 --> 00:40:22.559
Neck

503
00:40:27.039 --> 00:40:28.809
is 15.5.

504
00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.480
Hey.

505
00:41:13.159 --> 00:41:14.239
Hey.

506
00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.679
- Hey!
- Yes?

507
00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:22.199
Are we done?

508
00:41:22.679 --> 00:41:24.809
We're done. You can
put your jacket back on now.

509
00:41:32.289 --> 00:41:33.519
Ms. Mai,

510
00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.039
Da.

511
00:41:35.239 --> 00:41:37.639
Can I have a word with you two?

512
00:41:40.289 --> 00:41:42.159
Where are you going?

513
00:41:42.679 --> 00:41:44.119
Wait here. I'll be back.

514
00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:17.809
What's the matter?

515
00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:19.840
Did Tan say something inappropriate?

516
00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:25.880
I'm interested in Tanthai.

517
00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:30.920
Would you be okay

518
00:42:31.159 --> 00:42:32.329
if I

519
00:42:33.079 --> 00:42:35.159
made an outfit for him

520
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:38.360
to wear to the Siam Film Awards
tomorrow night?

521
00:42:39.719 --> 00:42:40.809
Pardon?

522
00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:46.960
Tan and I already have a fitting
scheduled with another brand.

523
00:42:47.199 --> 00:42:49.239
Rin, why are you...

524
00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:51.840
I've been thinking for a while now

525
00:42:52.119 --> 00:42:55.880
that I'd like to try something new.

526
00:42:57.769 --> 00:43:01.679
From now on, the Rarin brand will
sell men's clothing.

527
00:43:01.679 --> 00:43:03.809
Tanthai

528
00:43:04.159 --> 00:43:06.480
will be the first male actor

529
00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.039
that Rarin will dress for an event.

530
00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.519
Uh...

531
00:43:14.639 --> 00:43:15.960
Do you mean...

532
00:43:16.679 --> 00:43:19.000
This isn't a small matter.

533
00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.960
That's right. I think...

534
00:43:24.119 --> 00:43:25.199
That was really loud.

535
00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:55.239
You again?

536
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.920
Where have you been?

537
00:44:04.559 --> 00:44:07.760
I thought the voice I was hearing
was just my imagination.

538
00:44:10.559 --> 00:44:13.519
I have so many things
to talk to you about,

539
00:44:14.719 --> 00:44:16.039
Prince.

540
00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.199
No.

541
00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.239
You have a name now.

542
00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.039
Tanthai.

543
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:33.360
Wait.

544
00:44:38.239 --> 00:44:39.440
Are you Rarin?

545
00:44:51.119 --> 00:44:52.199
Then,

546
00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.639
what's the matter?

547
00:44:58.719 --> 00:45:01.719
Please, just get out of my head.

548
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:10.559
But we've finally met.

549
00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:14.159
I need to thank you

550
00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.960
and to talk to you about
many things.

551
00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.719
I have something
to tell you as well.

552
00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:38.880
I hate you so much.

553
00:45:51.519 --> 00:45:55.800
I want you to be the muse
for Rarin Couture.

554
00:45:56.159 --> 00:45:57.719
Seventeen for the front.

555
00:45:58.639 --> 00:46:00.440
So it's all
about business now, isn't it?

556
00:46:00.679 --> 00:46:04.199
Do you know how long I've been
annoyed with this nonsense?

557
00:46:04.199 --> 00:46:05.960
I don't care what this is about.

558
00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.599
I think we should stay away
from each other.

559
00:46:09.159 --> 00:46:10.360
Marry me.
