00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.719
Hello, Phop.

2
00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.840
I'm sorry for being late.

3
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.920
It's okay.

4
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.359
I figured that you'd come.

5
00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:53.560
Are you okay?

6
00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:54.879
Well,

7
00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.920
my eyes are stinging.

8
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.760
The sun's really bright today.

9
00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.239
Then try this.

10
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.479
Cut! Cut! Cut!

11
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.199
Tan.

12
00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.960
Can we do it again? You were
holding the product wrong.

13
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.560
But it's been 16 takes already.

14
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.039
The client's quite serious. Please?

15
00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:20.280
I'll show you.

16
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.370
Look here.

17
00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.000
Just look first.

18
00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.240
Dao,

19
00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:25.639
please use this.

20
00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.370
It's still missing...

21
00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:29.240
Tan!

22
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.400
Tan!

23
00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.960
- Rich kid.
- Tan.

24
00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.639
Be nice. This is Porsche.

25
00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:37.960
He's my movie's biggest sponsor.

26
00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.199
Sorry for all of the takes.

27
00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:44.120
I think the way you're
holding the product,

28
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.960
it's not charming.

29
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.560
So what should I do to please you...

30
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.039
Porsche?

31
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.759
Tan.

32
00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.360
Please be polite.

33
00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.120
It's okay, Director.

34
00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.759
I've met

35
00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:01.919
this guy lots of time before.

36
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.840
He's always running his mouth,
but I don't mind.

37
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.639
- Hey, you.
- Okay, okay.

38
00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.400
I'll let him do another take.

39
00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.639
Well,

40
00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:15.960
I think...

41
00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:19.960
The first take was perfect!

42
00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:22.800
The first take?

43
00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:24.159
Yes, it was the best.

44
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.240
As for the rest, I'll let you handle
what's needed during editing.

45
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.400
Thank you, everyone.

46
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.080
Thank you. Thanks, Tan.

47
00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.240
Sixteen takes?

48
00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:36.240
That's right.

49
00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:44.520
Come on. It's your first gig.
Don't get discouraged.

50
00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.800
It's your first movie and you're
working with a famous director.

51
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.719
There's even a sponsor.

52
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.919
You're future is going
to be so bright.

53
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.439
Just take whatever you can for now.

54
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.439
Apart from signing me up for a movie
without asking,

55
00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.800
you also sign me up
for whatever product is out there.

56
00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.199
You must be crazy.

57
00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.360
It's not just "whatever product."

58
00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.879
Come on. You're only under contract
for the shoot.

59
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.439
Besides, that...

60
00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.360
Porsche pays really well.

61
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.680
Isn't that good?
You'll be earning tons.

62
00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:30.680
Is money that important?

63
00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:33.050
Correct.

64
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.759
Very important.

65
00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.079
Are you smiling?

66
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.639
You're always so pessimistic.

67
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.839
I'm just being realistic.

68
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.279
"I'm just being realistic."

69
00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.279
(Profit and loss statement:
-476,000.80)

70
00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:56.759
(Profit and loss statement:
-476,000.80)

71
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.199
- Rin.
- Yes?

72
00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:08.920
The pattern is done. Would you
like to have a look right now?

73
00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.920
(Profit and loss statement:
-476,000.80)

74
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.879
- It needs to be draped again here.
- Alright.

75
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.399
- Sew on the buttons too.
- Okay.

76
00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:37.959
- Rin.
- Yes?

77
00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:40.279
Didn't the doctor say that
you needed to rest?

78
00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:42.519
That's true.

79
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.319
You just got out of the hospital.
You should be resting.

80
00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:48.879
I've been away for two days.

81
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.920
I have to work harder.

82
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.800
Otherwise, we won't make it in time
for the auction.

83
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.040
Don't worry.

84
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.959
It won't be a problem if you rest
for a few more days.

85
00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:59.639
I can handle everything here.

86
00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:03.920
Okay. I trust you, Da.

87
00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.040
And everyone else as well.

88
00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:13.120
By the way, how is Tanthai's
outfit coming along?

89
00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:15.560
I've created the pattern.

90
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.000
Are you going to sew it yourself?

91
00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:19.279
Yes, I'll do it.

92
00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:21.399
Rin?

93
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.879
Let's get married.

94
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.199
Are you in a bad mood?

95
00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:32.759
You're exhausted, aren't you?
You just got out of the hospital.

96
00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:34.160
Why aren't you resting?

97
00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.920
I went to take over
a resort in Samui.

98
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.120
Do you want to go there?

99
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.560
Don't you have to work?

100
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.800
Taking over a resort is also work.

101
00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:46.879
Go, then.

102
00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:48.079
So I'll book you a ticket?

103
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.240
Have a good trip.

104
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.639
I've got piles of work to do.

105
00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:55.399
Aren't you coming with me?

106
00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:56.480
No, I'm not.

107
00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.800
Then let's go out for a meal.

108
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.759
- I've eaten already.
- Dessert?

109
00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:02.839
- What about...
- Porsche.

110
00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.680
- Rin, I...
- Porsche.

111
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.680
You should go home for now.

112
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.680
Alright.

113
00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:20.839
Here.

114
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.920
Rin, Mai has arrived.

115
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.759
Okay.

116
00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:36.160
Well, then. Please take
a look at this one again.

117
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.360
- I will.
- Okay.

118
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.959
I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Mai.

119
00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:53.720
- It's okay. I can wait.
- Okay.

120
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.959
Tanthai didn't come today?

121
00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:00.639
He's unavailable so I came alone.

122
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.959
But don't worry.
I have power of attorney.

123
00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.079
Sure.

124
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.800
This is the contract I sent
for you to look over.

125
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.560
You can let me know
if there are any problems.

126
00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.759
I won't wear

127
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.039
Rarin's clothing anymore.

128
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.240
I don't want you going near
her anymore.

129
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.639
Her life is chaotic enough as it is.

130
00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.840
It's gotten more chaotic
since she met you.

131
00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:19.960
She's already exhausted.

132
00:09:20.519 --> 00:09:21.639
I hope you understand.

133
00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:31.480
Tan,

134
00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:33.960
you're here.

135
00:09:34.159 --> 00:09:35.639
I've been looking
for you for a while now.

136
00:09:35.759 --> 00:09:38.639
You wouldn't answer any of my calls.

137
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:44.159
I'd like to talk to you about
the outfit for the auction gala.

138
00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:45.360
Tan?

139
00:09:45.639 --> 00:09:46.720
Tan!

140
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.279
What's wrong?

141
00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:54.090
Why are you avoiding me?

142
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.240
It's nothing.

143
00:09:58.159 --> 00:10:01.639
How is that nothing?
It's so obvious.

144
00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:03.879
Tell me. What's wrong?

145
00:10:08.159 --> 00:10:10.090
I don't want to be
your mannequin anymore.

146
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.879
I won't wear
your clothes ever again.

147
00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:22.879
Stop interfering in my life.

148
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.799
- Tanthai, you're on in ten.
- Okay.

149
00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:45.639
Don't do this again.

150
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.519
Hello, Aek.

151
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.120
Thank you very much, Phop.

152
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.200
You're all wet.

153
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.840
It's okay. I'd get wet anyway.

154
00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:23.639
I have to go now.

155
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.360
Thank you again.

156
00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:26.639
I'll see you later.

157
00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:29.720
Smile.

158
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.039
Smile.

159
00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:36.480
You're in love. Smile.

160
00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:38.919
Smile.

161
00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.720
Smile! Hey!

162
00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:43.960
Why aren't you smiling? Cut!

163
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.279
Scene 72, cut 1, take 3. Tail slate!

164
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.559
Excuse me.

165
00:11:53.639 --> 00:11:57.399
You have to smile.
You're falling in love with him.

166
00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.679
You supposed to feel good
because he's worried about you.

167
00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:03.279
Why? Why are you so spaced out?

168
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.240
Didn't you read the script?

169
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.799
Hey! Stop the rain!

170
00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:11.559
Stop now! Tan, get out of the way!

171
00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:14.000
It's not your cue yet.
Pay attention!

172
00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:21.799
You were great just now.

173
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.919
- Really?
- Yes.

174
00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:28.399
Where's Primrose?

175
00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:31.480
I don't know. The bathroom, maybe?

176
00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:34.679
You should go and get changed.

177
00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:36.080
So you can hurry up
and finish shooting.

178
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.000
There's a fitting with Rarin
tomorrow morning.

179
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.320
What fitting?

180
00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.639
For the Thai Textile gala.

181
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.360
Mai,

182
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.879
I told you I'm not going
to wear Rarin's clothes anymore.

183
00:12:54.799 --> 00:12:55.879
You have to.

184
00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.480
I signed you up to be
the muse for Rarin.

185
00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:00.000
Hey!

186
00:13:00.919 --> 00:13:02.000
What did you say?

187
00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:05.799
I signed the contract for you to be
the muse for Rarin. Is that clear?

188
00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.159
Aren't you going to ask me first?

189
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.519
Well,

190
00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:12.840
it will be good to be Rarin's muse.

191
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.759
The pay is great too. How can you
let this opportunity pass you by?

192
00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:18.039
- But I...
- No buts!

193
00:13:19.159 --> 00:13:20.879
Considering your past scandals,

194
00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:22.440
other than this muse gig,

195
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.480
no one wants
to work with you anymore.

196
00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.039
I'm sorry

197
00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:52.279
for signing the contract
without telling you.

198
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.960
But I did it for you

199
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.279
and Rung.

200
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:02.799
For Rung?

201
00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:07.480
For Rung? For Rung? For Rung?

202
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.679
Why do you keep
using her as an excuse?

203
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.480
If you want the money, just tell me.

204
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.960
Mai, why do have to use
Rung as your excuse?

205
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:20.559
Isn't that a little too harsh, Tan?

206
00:14:21.159 --> 00:14:23.120
- You don't understand at all?
- I don't.

207
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.279
And I don't want to.

208
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.759
You're selfish, do you know that?

209
00:14:29.039 --> 00:14:30.519
You've gone too far.

210
00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:33.440
Don't say that
I've done all of this for myself.

211
00:14:33.879 --> 00:14:35.559
If you're really doing it for me,

212
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.519
then have you ever even thought
about my feelings?

213
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.960
What about me being stuck
taking care of you and Rung?

214
00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.559
And cleaning up after
what you've done?

215
00:14:45.559 --> 00:14:47.159
Have you ever thought
about my feelings?

216
00:14:57.519 --> 00:14:58.600
I don't know.

217
00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:00.440
Tear up that contract.

218
00:15:02.519 --> 00:15:04.039
Stop being so stupid.

219
00:15:05.159 --> 00:15:06.840
We need money.

220
00:15:07.159 --> 00:15:09.360
We've got enough problems already!

221
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.200
We have so many responsibilities!

222
00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.960
- If we don't have money, Rung...
- Mai!

223
00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.920
Don't forget to come
to the fitting tomorrow.

224
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.890
It's almost event day.

225
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.480
Do you really want to change me?

226
00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:31.799
Or are you just doing it
for the reputation of your brand?

227
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.440
If you're going to help build
my brand's reputation,

228
00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.240
then I have to transform
a scarecrow into a prince first.

229
00:17:41.359 --> 00:17:42.480
A scarecrow?

230
00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:45.650
Hey.

231
00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:49.319
Are you really upset?

232
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.119
I'm kidding.

233
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.240
In the end,

234
00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.759
everyone's just doing it
for business reasons, right?

235
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:01.960
To be fair,

236
00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.890
on the one hand,
I have to do it for the business.

237
00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:06.680
But on the other hand,

238
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.480
I really am doing this for you.

239
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.559
Because I know you're not like
what people say you are.

240
00:18:15.279 --> 00:18:17.960
Don't you want to
do it for yourself?

241
00:18:19.079 --> 00:18:20.359
Are you sure

242
00:18:21.039 --> 00:18:22.799
that the voice you hear
is actually my voice?

243
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.519
I'm an actor.

244
00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:30.119
The voice you hear

245
00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:32.170
might just be me impersonating
someone else.

246
00:18:34.319 --> 00:18:36.440
You're not with me all the time.

247
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:39.039
You don't really know me.

248
00:18:39.519 --> 00:18:40.650
Tan.

249
00:18:42.039 --> 00:18:43.599
You want to change me, right?

250
00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:50.119
What if I do this?

251
00:18:52.319 --> 00:18:55.759
Do you think I'm still
your stupid prince?

252
00:19:34.359 --> 00:19:35.650
I'm disappointed.

253
00:19:51.839 --> 00:19:53.279
Yesterday,

254
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.839
he talked to me.

255
00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.039
He said he wanted a gold limousine.

256
00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:04.039
I want to know if it's your idea.

257
00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:07.319
It's not mine. Maybe it's his idea.

258
00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:09.839
Let's continue
this conversation later.

259
00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:12.240
- Okay, Dad.
- Junior.

260
00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:14.410
Are you staying here tonight?

261
00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:15.680
Don't act all innocent, Dad.

262
00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.559
You always confiscate my stuff
when you want my attention.

263
00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:20.079
And now the condo.

264
00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.759
Calm down. Sit down and talk.

265
00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:23.839
I won't.

266
00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:27.480
Do you know that your sister

267
00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.240
is going to get married before you?

268
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.680
You're not young anymore.

269
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.599
I think it's time.

270
00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:37.960
This again?

271
00:20:38.799 --> 00:20:40.960
You said you'd let me
follow my heart.

272
00:20:41.279 --> 00:20:42.720
Who is it this time?

273
00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:49.680
My friend, Charn.

274
00:20:50.119 --> 00:20:51.410
He's in negotiations

275
00:20:52.039 --> 00:20:53.720
to buy fifty-one percent

276
00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.839
of BJ Group's shares.

277
00:20:57.359 --> 00:20:58.720
He's my rival.

278
00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.519
If we don't tie our family with his,

279
00:21:01.279 --> 00:21:03.240
there's going to be
problems in the future.

280
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.440
So I made an appointment with
his daughter, Cindy.

281
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.170
So you can meet her.

282
00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:12.680
- You remember Cindy?
- I don't.

283
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:13.759
And I don't care.

284
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:17.359
Before that, it was Makino.
And someone else before her.

285
00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:19.240
If you think this one's nice,
you can marry her.

286
00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:20.480
Porsche.

287
00:21:26.759 --> 00:21:27.890
I told you

288
00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:30.240
that true love

289
00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.279
comes with a price.

290
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.359
You only think about business.

291
00:21:35.359 --> 00:21:37.079
We agreed that you wouldn't
get involved in this.

292
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.890
I'm going to marry
whomever I want to.

293
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.039
I'm not going to marry
someone you arrange for me.

294
00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:43.839
- Praew.
- Yes?

295
00:21:44.279 --> 00:21:45.480
Tell your brother.

296
00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:47.240
How is it

297
00:21:47.599 --> 00:21:48.680
with the person I chose for you?

298
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.039
Yes, Dad.

299
00:21:52.279 --> 00:21:55.640
But I'm lucky
that I get along with Mark.

300
00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:00.759
But Cindy and Porsche
haven't even met yet.

301
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.000
I think it's too soon.

302
00:22:04.519 --> 00:22:05.599
You've got a point.

303
00:22:08.079 --> 00:22:09.160
A matter like this,

304
00:22:10.319 --> 00:22:11.480
just let them get married.

305
00:22:11.759 --> 00:22:12.960
They'll fall in love eventually.

306
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.119
Don't say that. I don't want
to listen. That's your generation.

307
00:22:16.279 --> 00:22:17.559
This is my day and age.
Just stay out of it.

308
00:22:17.559 --> 00:22:19.359
And stop drinking so much!

309
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.759
Really!

310
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:21.960
Oh?

311
00:22:26.119 --> 00:22:28.519
Hold on, stand up straight.

312
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.440
Don't hunch. Straighten up.

313
00:22:36.279 --> 00:22:37.359
Is it okay?

314
00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.039
Yes.

315
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.720
- Is it comfortable?
- It's fine.

316
00:22:45.079 --> 00:22:46.160
Tan.

317
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.680
Can you behave?

318
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.920
I'm standing still
just like a mannequin does.

319
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.519
Just do whatever you need.

320
00:23:01.519 --> 00:23:04.920
Everyone, can you
go outside for a little while?

321
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.519
Okay.

322
00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.640
You said you're a mannequin
but where's your brain?

323
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.079
Do I need it for a fitting?

324
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.960
What's wrong with you?
You're acting like a child.

325
00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.440
Be professional!

326
00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:54.759
Be professional?

327
00:23:56.279 --> 00:23:58.119
Do I have to spin around
and show you as well?

328
00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:19.640
Do you know

329
00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.680
how much time I spent making this?

330
00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.279
The outfit you're wearing.

331
00:24:29.119 --> 00:24:31.920
Do you think I just picked
the fabric and made it?

332
00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:35.880
I've spent days researching
which outfits would best suit you.

333
00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.599
My team has

334
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.880
spent hundreds of hours

335
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.799
to create the best possible
piece of work.

336
00:24:49.839 --> 00:24:51.839
There are dozens of people

337
00:24:52.599 --> 00:24:54.839
who are working tirelessly
just to do what they love.

338
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.400
And me, a designer,

339
00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.400
I respect everyone
who wears my clothes.

340
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.880
I've had enough.

341
00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.559
Maybe it's my misunderstanding

342
00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.039
that you're the prince.

343
00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.079
Actually, no.

344
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.599
That you could become
a better person.

345
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.680
You look good in this outfit.

346
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.440
I made the right decision.

347
00:26:33.119 --> 00:26:34.319
What's that?

348
00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.599
Each outfit

349
00:26:37.599 --> 00:26:40.000
can't be perfect on its own.

350
00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:43.880
It's the person who wears it
that makes it perfect.

351
00:26:45.559 --> 00:26:48.200
Just like this outfit and you.

352
00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:04.960
Awesome!

353
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:06.960
Well done.

354
00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:10.480
This year's award for
best actor goes to

355
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.400
Mr. Tanthai.

356
00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:17.200
You're such a good actor.

357
00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.920
Rin will probably
start hating you now.

358
00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:24.359
What should I reward you with?

359
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.480
Should I give you a raise to

360
00:27:27.079 --> 00:27:28.519
five million baht?

361
00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:35.759
If it's about money,

362
00:27:36.599 --> 00:27:39.559
please discuss it with my manager.

363
00:27:40.079 --> 00:27:41.880
I did.

364
00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.559
But she refused.

365
00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:46.480
Initially proposed ten million
for you to be the presenter

366
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.200
and to do the company's
CSR activities for an entire year.

367
00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.680
But she said we should part ways
after this movie.

368
00:27:55.079 --> 00:27:57.880
She refused ten million.
What a joke.

369
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.559
Apart from signing me up for a movie
without asking,

370
00:28:03.359 --> 00:28:06.079
you also sign me up
for whatever product is out there.

371
00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.400
You must be crazy.

372
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.160
It's not just "whatever product."

373
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.960
Come on. You're only under contract
for the shoot.

374
00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.039
- You don't understand at all?
- I don't.

375
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.240
And I don't want to.

376
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.720
You're selfish, do you know that?

377
00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.480
You've gone too far.

378
00:28:24.079 --> 00:28:26.480
Don't say that
I've done all of this for myself.

379
00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:30.480
There are dozens of people

380
00:28:31.359 --> 00:28:33.720
who are working tirelessly
just to do what they love.

381
00:28:35.359 --> 00:28:38.079
And me, a designer,

382
00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.119
I respect everyone

383
00:28:40.759 --> 00:28:42.960
who wears my clothes.

384
00:28:49.079 --> 00:28:50.880
I'm so silly.

385
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.519
I have to thank you.

386
00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.359
My eyes have finally opened.

387
00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.640
From now, I should be nicer

388
00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.000
to show my gratitude towards
the people who are nice to me.

389
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.720
That's good.

390
00:29:17.319 --> 00:29:18.480
But...

391
00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.440
What can someone like you do?

392
00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.720
You told me to stay away from Rin.

393
00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:34.920
I don't think I can do that anymore.

394
00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:49.559
Excuse me.

395
00:30:37.079 --> 00:30:39.680
How's it going? Da? Jib?
Is everything okay?

396
00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.359
A lot of people are interested.

397
00:30:43.359 --> 00:30:46.720
That's good. Then please help me
take care of them.

398
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.039
You can trust us. Don't worry.

399
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.759
- Jib, I'm going inside.
- Okay.

400
00:30:53.799 --> 00:30:54.880
Hello, Rin.

401
00:30:55.079 --> 00:30:56.920
- Hello.
- Your work is impressive.

402
00:30:58.039 --> 00:31:01.119
Thank you. I've seen yours too.

403
00:31:01.119 --> 00:31:02.480
They're all very beautiful.

404
00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.039
It's unbelievable that you've been
able to bring Tan this far.

405
00:31:10.039 --> 00:31:11.880
Even though
his reputation is quite...

406
00:31:16.839 --> 00:31:19.359
People usually judge me
based on only what they've heard.

407
00:31:19.839 --> 00:31:22.440
I hope you're not one of them.

408
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.880
I’m just letting you know.

409
00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.440
I've been in the business
for a while now.

410
00:31:29.079 --> 00:31:32.359
I've seen lots of celebrities come
and go because of their mouths.

411
00:31:34.119 --> 00:31:35.480
Another thing,

412
00:31:35.599 --> 00:31:37.519
the value of the outfits
in today's event

413
00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:39.319
depends on

414
00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.319
the appropriateness

415
00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.759
and the satisfaction of the bidder.

416
00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.480
I just want you to be careful.

417
00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.960
A beautiful outfit like this

418
00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:52.799
might not get sold
because of its lame hanger.

419
00:31:56.119 --> 00:31:58.039
It's great being a lame hanger.

420
00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:00.240
That way, people will
focus on the outfit.

421
00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.160
Kan, I'd like to interview you
about your outfit.

422
00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.240
Of course.

423
00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.039
I have to excuse myself now.

424
00:32:35.839 --> 00:32:37.759
- Mai.
- What?

425
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.559
Can I have a word?

426
00:32:41.039 --> 00:32:42.119
Sure.

427
00:32:52.759 --> 00:32:53.960
Mai.

428
00:32:55.079 --> 00:32:56.519
Well, I...

429
00:32:56.519 --> 00:32:57.599
I'm sorry.

430
00:33:03.839 --> 00:33:06.559
I'm probably selfish like you said.

431
00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.200
I'm sorry

432
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.960
for accepting a job without
discussing it with you first.

433
00:33:14.039 --> 00:33:15.519
I'll ask you next time.

434
00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.559
It's not that.

435
00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.279
You've got to do your job.

436
00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.920
But thanks.

437
00:33:27.359 --> 00:33:29.400
I want to apologize to you

438
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.759
for being too harsh.

439
00:33:32.279 --> 00:33:33.640
- And...
- Hold on.

440
00:33:36.759 --> 00:33:37.880
Are my ears playing tricks on me?

441
00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:39.839
You? You're apologizing to me?

442
00:33:43.119 --> 00:33:44.680
Don't tease me!

443
00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.480
I won't. Go on.

444
00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:52.799
Well...

445
00:33:54.079 --> 00:33:56.640
I was being difficult.

446
00:33:59.119 --> 00:34:02.440
I didn't realize that the people
around me are trying to help,

447
00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.000
including you.

448
00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.719
I can't promise

449
00:34:09.719 --> 00:34:11.199
that I'll behave better next time.

450
00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.440
But I'm going to try.

451
00:34:19.039 --> 00:34:20.559
I'm going to cry.

452
00:34:22.769 --> 00:34:26.039
I never dreamed that this day
would come, brother!

453
00:34:26.559 --> 00:34:28.920
Why are you teasing me?
I'm not talking to you anymore.

454
00:34:29.769 --> 00:34:33.119
Let me hear it again.
What did you just say?

455
00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:37.400
Now, it's time for the outfit that
everyone's been waiting to see.

456
00:34:37.559 --> 00:34:40.079
A design from Kritsana,

457
00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:42.159
an artisan fashion brand
of Thailand.

458
00:34:42.159 --> 00:34:46.079
From the hands of the creative
director, Kan Kritsana.

459
00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:48.559
An iconic silhouette

460
00:34:48.559 --> 00:34:50.599
that evolved from

461
00:34:50.599 --> 00:34:52.329
highly-respected Thai textiles

462
00:34:52.329 --> 00:34:54.440
combined with a classical

463
00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.199
and contemporary touch.

464
00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:58.880
The bidding for this outfit
will start at 100,000 baht.

465
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.039
If you're ready, let's get started.

Is there anyone
who'd like to go higher?

One million.

500
00:37:39.769 --> 00:37:41.119
One million going once!

501
00:37:41.239 --> 00:37:42.719
One million going twice!

502
00:37:42.719 --> 00:37:44.039

There are still other outfits from
different brands to auction off.

506
00:38:05.559 --> 00:38:09.329
Let's have a look at the next one.

507
00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:18.559
Rin?

508
00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:24.199
You can go now, Da, Jib.

509
00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:28.519
Goodbye.

510
00:38:30.239 --> 00:38:32.289
I'm sorry I didn't make it in time.
The traffic was bad.

511
00:38:32.559 --> 00:38:35.079
- How's the event?
- Why did you bid on my outfit?

512
00:38:36.809 --> 00:38:37.880
Me?

513
00:38:38.559 --> 00:38:40.440
I didn't.

514
00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.519
How much did it sell for?

515
00:38:41.639 --> 00:38:45.920
- One hundred thousand.
- One million! I paid for it...

516
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.289
Why did you do that?

517
00:38:53.719 --> 00:38:55.119
I just wanted to help.

518
00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.559
You should be happy.
You got the highest bid.

519
00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:59.440
How can I be happy?

520
00:39:00.239 --> 00:39:02.400
It's a worthless success.

521
00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.960
I got it but I didn't deserve it.

522
00:39:11.559 --> 00:39:13.199
It's because we know each other.

523
00:39:13.559 --> 00:39:14.639
That's all.

524
00:39:15.159 --> 00:39:17.400
Easy, Rin. You deserved it.

525
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.480
- I...
- Prove it.

526
00:39:20.599 --> 00:39:21.960
Do you dare to prove it?

527
00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.079
That you paid one million

528
00:39:26.119 --> 00:39:27.719
because you value my outfit.

529
00:39:28.329 --> 00:39:29.440
And not me.

530
00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.519
As for the outfit,

531
00:39:37.039 --> 00:39:38.599
you can take it if you want.

532
00:39:39.329 --> 00:39:41.639
But I'll pay the one million baht.

533
00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.079
I'm sorry.

534
00:39:51.039 --> 00:39:52.920
I didn't mean to insult you.

535
00:39:58.719 --> 00:39:59.809
Then I'll...

536
00:40:01.519 --> 00:40:03.519
I should excuse myself.

537
00:40:22.639 --> 00:40:23.809
You're rich now.

538
00:40:25.119 --> 00:40:26.400
You've earned one million baht.

539
00:40:30.559 --> 00:40:31.639
Tan,

540
00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:34.079
this is a charity event.

541
00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.559
Oh?

542
00:40:37.289 --> 00:40:38.360
Really?

543
00:40:39.519 --> 00:40:40.639
Are you okay with that?

544
00:40:41.239 --> 00:40:42.809
You're capable of feeling concern
for other people?

545
00:40:46.719 --> 00:40:49.480
I'm sorry about the other day.

546
00:40:51.039 --> 00:40:52.639
I was being silly.

547
00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:58.960
What are you playing at?

548
00:41:00.159 --> 00:41:03.159
You're talking to me nicely
only because you see that I'm sad.

549
00:41:03.289 --> 00:41:06.639
Well, you remind me of someone.

550
00:41:07.199 --> 00:41:10.079
Someone who used to make me
a better person than this.

551
00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:13.119
Thank you for reminding me.

552
00:41:14.599 --> 00:41:15.679
Sure.

553
00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.920
Should I forgive you?

554
00:41:23.639 --> 00:41:25.199
But you're an actor.

555
00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.440
So?

556
00:41:27.599 --> 00:41:30.329
How can I know
that your apology is sincere?

557
00:41:31.329 --> 00:41:32.559
Are you joking?

558
00:41:36.239 --> 00:41:37.769
I really am apologizing to you.

559
00:41:38.289 --> 00:41:41.199
I'll eat cat poop to prove it.

560
00:41:45.079 --> 00:41:47.559
Alright.

561
00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.559
I forgive you.

562
00:41:49.559 --> 00:41:50.639
Really?

563
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.960
Thank you.

564
00:41:52.119 --> 00:41:53.329
But get down on your knees.

565
00:41:54.329 --> 00:41:55.400
Huh?

566
00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.809
Come on. Get down on your knees.

567
00:42:00.769 --> 00:42:02.639
Are you crazy? Right here?

568
00:42:03.039 --> 00:42:04.119
I don't want to.

569
00:42:04.719 --> 00:42:06.639
This suit will get dirty too.

570
00:42:07.679 --> 00:42:11.769
If the suit gets dirty,
I can wash it.

571
00:42:13.639 --> 00:42:15.769
But I can't wash away

572
00:42:16.119 --> 00:42:17.769
the pain in my heart.

573
00:42:36.679 --> 00:42:37.769
Tan?

574
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.079
Tan?

575
00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:43.079
Tan, are you for real?

576
00:42:43.719 --> 00:42:45.769
Well, I...

577
00:42:45.769 --> 00:42:47.039
My shoelace came undone.

578
00:42:49.239 --> 00:42:50.329
Jerk.

579
00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.960
Your shoes don't have shoelaces.

580
00:43:20.809 --> 00:43:22.289
Actually,

581
00:43:22.769 --> 00:43:25.199
your outfit today was beautiful.
It's worth the bid price.

582
00:43:26.679 --> 00:43:27.960
What do you mean?

583
00:43:28.639 --> 00:43:30.360
The one that was auctioned.

584
00:43:31.519 --> 00:43:35.289
Tan, there's no need to flatter me
or try to cheer me up.

585
00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:37.719
I wasn't flattering you.

586
00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:42.400
I believe that when we put our minds
into doing something,

587
00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.679
the effort is priceless.

588
00:43:48.519 --> 00:43:49.920
You're being strange today.

589
00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:52.960
How strange?

590
00:43:53.559 --> 00:43:54.719
Well,

591
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.400
you're acting

592
00:43:59.159 --> 00:44:01.079
like a prince that I'm fond of.

593
00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.679
You're here. The reporters
want to interview you.

594
00:44:21.599 --> 00:44:22.679
Over there.

595
00:44:27.079 --> 00:44:28.239
It's over there.

596
00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.719
So now you're officially
the muse of Rarin?

597
00:44:37.079 --> 00:44:38.159
That's right.

598
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:41.079
Even though I'm new
to the fashion world,

599
00:44:41.199 --> 00:44:42.719
it's opened up my eyes to so many
new possibilities.

600
00:44:43.199 --> 00:44:44.960
I now know
what it means to be a muse.

601
00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.360
How do you feel about the name
"Prince" that Rarin gave you?

602
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.360
I was quite
self-centered previously.

603
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.199
If you ask me
if I've become the prince,

604
00:44:55.599 --> 00:44:57.559
I might not be there today,

605
00:44:58.159 --> 00:45:00.480
but I can better the best version
of Tanthai.

606
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.079
That's very lovely.

607
00:45:04.239 --> 00:45:06.760
Today I'd like to
take a photo of you.

608
00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.239
Okay.

609
00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.840
This camera, please.

610
00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.000
- Hello?
- Where are you?

611
00:45:18.159 --> 00:45:19.400
Why didn't you answer my calls?

612
00:45:19.599 --> 00:45:21.119
I'm at the studio.

613
00:45:21.119 --> 00:45:22.800
Rin, what happened?

614
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.039
I'm fine.

615
00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.840
It's just a flat tire.

616
00:45:26.079 --> 00:45:27.760
It's not a big deal.

617
00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:28.840
It is!

618
00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.599
I'll take that off for you.

619
00:45:33.119 --> 00:45:35.320
Rin, listen to me.

620
00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.840
You're in danger. Do you know that?

621
00:45:38.079 --> 00:45:40.480
Rin! Get out of there!
