1
00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:40.480
Tan.

2
00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:56.439
Tan!

3
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.280
Rin.

4
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.840
Rin.

5
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:36.960
What's the matter?

6
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.560
Nothing.

7
00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.560
I just thought that
you looked beautiful.

8
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.840
A handsome guy complimented me.

9
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.759
I'm about to get married.
Don't distract me.

10
00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.159
It's because you
really are beautiful.

11
00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.080
It's only natural that
Tanthai would compliment you.

12
00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:11.240
I'm able to look this beautiful

13
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.719
thanks to you.
You made the dress for me.

14
00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:15.560
It's really beautiful.

15
00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.960
I'm happy that you like it.

16
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.879
Thank you. It's so pretty.

17
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.199
What about you? How are you doing?

18
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.960
Is your suit alright?

19
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.960
Mmm.

20
00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.319
Tanthai,

21
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.479
thank you very much
for coming to my wedding.

22
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.879
Not at all. It's an honor
for me to be invited.

23
00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:43.199
Thank you.

24
00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.159
When is it going to be your turn?

25
00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:55.560
Well, I...

26
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.439
You're a woman. If you marry late,
it will be hard to get pregnant.

27
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.439
If you found someone you like,
don't let him get away.

28
00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.800
If there's nothing else for me,
I have to excuse myself.

29
00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.840
- I have some other errands to run.
- Alright.

30
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.120
Okay.

31
00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:20.759
Da,

32
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.439
please take care of Tanthai

33
00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:26.959
- and put his suit in a bag.
- Of course.

34
00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:28.399
This way, please.

35
00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.680
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

36
00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.199
Goodbye.

37
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.800
You can't stop looking at him.
Do you have feelings for him?

38
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.639
No!

39
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.240
Really?

40
00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:51.879
Really.

41
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.560
Tanthai and I are only colleagues.

42
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.730
Besides, he probably has

43
00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.610
someone else.

44
00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:08.480
Then,

45
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.839
my brother can still hope.

46
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.120
- Porsche?
- Mmm.

47
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.170
Seriously,

48
00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:21.240
it would make me so happy to
have you as my sister-in-law.

49
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.610
Praew!

50
00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.040
Wow, speak of the devil.

51
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.360
He's here.

52
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.480
They say the lobster here
is really tasty.

53
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.000
Would you like to try some?

54
00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:53.959
Are you okay?

55
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.199
I'm fine.

56
00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.160
You're acting strange.

57
00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:07.160
No one forced you
to do something again, right?

58
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.920
You're overthinking it.

59
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.639
Tell me if there's anything.

60
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.399
Don't keep it all inside.

61
00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:18.560
You don't have to do
what you don't want to do.

62
00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:20.839
Well...

63
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.000
Actually, I...

64
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.959
I have to go to the bathroom.

65
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.839
I think that's all for today.

66
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.959
I'll transfer you money
for the food and labor.

67
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.800
Mmm. Thanks.

68
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.040
Didn't you want
to tell me something?

69
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.519
It's nothing.

70
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.720
Tan,

71
00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.680
why are you so nice to me?

72
00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:26.800
Me?

73
00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:28.600
How am I nice?

74
00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:32.199
You agreed to have dinner with me

75
00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.879
even though people are
gossiping about us.

76
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.639
And you're very thoughtful
about my feelings.

77
00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:42.560
It's not a big deal, right?

78
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.680
I don't really want to do this.

79
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.439
What do you mean?

80
00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:54.920
I'm an actor nowadays

81
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.839
for a reason.

82
00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.720
So when I saw you trying to force
yourself to do something like me,

83
00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:02.360
I probably felt sorry for you.

84
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.319
I'm such a fool.

85
00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:13.800
I'm sorry

86
00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:16.639
for telling you
to stop forcing yourself.

87
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.360
I kept telling you
that you have a choice

88
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.240
but even I can't follow
my own advice.

89
00:08:25.839 --> 00:08:27.959
So if it's enough
to answer your question of

90
00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:29.759
why I'm being nice to you,

91
00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:32.759
it's probably because

92
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.450
I don't want you to be like me.

93
00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:41.759
Tan.

94
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.090
Please.

95
00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:11.639
Watch your step.

96
00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:17.210
Praew's wedding is almost here.

97
00:09:17.639 --> 00:09:20.720
Now that she's tried out the dress,
I'm feeling kind of sad.

98
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:27.919
Tonight's omakase has three
Michelin stars.

99
00:09:27.919 --> 00:09:30.919
The waitlist is until December but
I was able to get us a table.

100
00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:34.879
Mmm.

101
00:09:35.799 --> 00:09:37.120
What's up with you tonight?

102
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.639
Nothing.

103
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.840
Oh?

104
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.240
Wait, wait, wait!

105
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.639
What's wrong? Tell me.

106
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.120
- There's nothing.
- How is that possible?

107
00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:53.600
I'm probably thinking about work.

108
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.879
Let's go.

109
00:09:55.879 --> 00:09:57.120
Work?

110
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.840
You don't like omakase?

111
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.000
That's right.

112
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.960
There's another place
that's even better.

113
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.919
Let's cancel. Forget it.
This one's much better. Let's go.

114
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.639
(Kae's Pork Blood Soup)

115
00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:14.399
Hold on a second.
This place is good.

116
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.960
Trust me.

117
00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:20.279
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

118
00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:22.639
Here it is.

119
00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:24.240
Eat up, Rin.

120
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.330
Hmm?

121
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.399
Excuse me?

122
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.399
Did he hire you?

123
00:10:35.039 --> 00:10:36.210
I don't know him.

124
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:37.960
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:40.919
What are you doing?

126
00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:42.330
He might punch you.

127
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.840
How am I supposed to know?

128
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.639
I didn't think you'd
know a place like this.

129
00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:48.480
What do you think?
Do you think I'm too posh?

130
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:50.159
Mmm.

131
00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:53.639
Eat up or it'll get cold.

132
00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:04.480
Mmm! This is great!

133
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.559
Told you.

134
00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:10.159
How did you know about this place?

135
00:11:11.919 --> 00:11:16.000
Remember when we were in the UK?
You wanted to have the soup.

136
00:11:16.159 --> 00:11:17.639
We searched the whole island
but we couldn't find anywhere.

137
00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:19.200
I remember.

138
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.559
You didn't even know what
pork blood soup was back then.

139
00:11:22.559 --> 00:11:24.480
I didn't understand
why you'd eat blood.

140
00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.200
So after I came back,

141
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.720
I went around
sampling pork blood soup

142
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.120
to see which place is best. So I
could take you when you returned.

143
00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:40.960
Eat a little more.

144
00:11:42.879 --> 00:11:45.600
Let's just say that
this place is really great.

145
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:49.039
Thank you. I'll come again
more often.

146
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.600
I'm happy that you like it.

147
00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.600
Mmm!

148
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.279
Actually,

149
00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:04.960
how long have we known each other?

150
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.320
3 years, 237 days

151
00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:09.320
and 8 hours and 3 minutes.

152
00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:13.840
Wow, you're precise.

153
00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:16.720
I told you if it's about you,
I know everything.

154
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.960
Do you want to try me?

155
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.759
- Favorite color.
- Pink.

156
00:12:20.919 --> 00:12:22.639
- Most hated creature.
- Cockroaches, for sure.

157
00:12:22.639 --> 00:12:25.440
- Favorite movie.
- "The Devil Wears Prada."

158
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.440
Wow, you're good.

159
00:12:31.559 --> 00:12:33.440
You really are my best friend.

160
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:37.840
Mmm.

161
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.440
Hmm?

162
00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:45.720
There's one thing about you

163
00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.960
that I still don't know.

164
00:12:53.919 --> 00:12:56.480
When are you going
to accept that my feelings

165
00:12:59.919 --> 00:13:01.960
towards you are more than friends?

166
00:13:23.919 --> 00:13:27.480
I know I might not be your prince.

167
00:13:30.039 --> 00:13:32.159
But can you at least
let me be your knight

168
00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:35.559
so that I can always be there
to protect you?

169
00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.120
Let's eat or it'll get cold.

170
00:14:09.679 --> 00:14:10.799
We're here.

171
00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:16.840
Thanks for tonight.

172
00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.279
No biggie. Anytime.

173
00:14:28.559 --> 00:14:30.480
Don't forget to come and get
the suit for Praew's wedding.

174
00:14:30.799 --> 00:14:32.679
I won't. I'll be there.

175
00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:33.799
Okay.

176
00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:35.519
See you.

177
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:38.720
Rin,

178
00:14:42.879 --> 00:14:44.360
the question I asked you,

179
00:14:46.039 --> 00:14:47.120
don't forget about it.

180
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.720
I'm going to demand an answer soon.

181
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.159
I have to go now. See you.

182
00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.759
Aren't you going home tonight?

183
00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:38.000
I want to be alone tonight.

184
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.360
I won't bother you then.

185
00:16:12.279 --> 00:16:14.320
It's actually difficult being you.

186
00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:17.960
What are you talking about?

187
00:16:18.759 --> 00:16:22.080
You have to help
a self-centered muse like me

188
00:16:22.759 --> 00:16:26.000
and take care of your business.

189
00:16:30.799 --> 00:16:32.240
What do you mean by that?

190
00:16:35.879 --> 00:16:37.200
The guy who dropped you off

191
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:40.360
must have helped you a lot.

192
00:16:42.679 --> 00:16:43.960
Are you insulting me?

193
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.080
You're saying it as if
I approached him for money.

194
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.799
Isn't that true?

195
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.159
You need money to build a business.

196
00:16:52.679 --> 00:16:55.159
So you need someone to cling to.

197
00:17:00.759 --> 00:17:02.200
Have you gone crazy?

198
00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:09.440
I need money for business

199
00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:13.410
but that doesn't mean
I have to leech off Porsche.

200
00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.119
Well...

201
00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.480
I...

202
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.319
Is this who my muse is?

203
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.680
I'm trying to do everything
to make my brand a success.

204
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.920
But you spend your time
stirring up rumors

205
00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.650
and gossip with a female celebrity.

206
00:17:35.799 --> 00:17:37.559
And now you're accusing me
of leeching off my friend.

207
00:17:38.559 --> 00:17:39.759
How disappointing.

208
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:42.960
Stirring up rumors?

209
00:17:45.839 --> 00:17:47.920
You're acting strange

210
00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.170
because of Primrose?

211
00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.079
If it's about her, I can explain.

212
00:17:52.359 --> 00:17:53.359
Rin!

213
00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:30.480
Why

214
00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.759
isn't it raining?

215
00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.480
Tanthai hasn't picked up his suit?

216
00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.359
Isn't the wedding tomorrow?

217
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.200
He'll probably come
when he has the time.

218
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.440
Rin!

219
00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:56.759
Rin.

220
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.519
I'm here for my suit.

221
00:19:01.079 --> 00:19:03.720
Found it. Is it this one?

222
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.890
It's not.

223
00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:06.960
That one is for Tanthai.

224
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.000
Yours is this one.

225
00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:27.319
Are you free tonight?
Should we have dinner together?

226
00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:29.200
I'm sorry.

227
00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:31.000
I probably can't make it.

228
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:32.480
I might have to finish late.

229
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.720
It's okay. I'm still not hungry.
I can wait.

230
00:19:38.319 --> 00:19:41.170
I don't think so.
Let's save it for another time.

231
00:19:45.319 --> 00:19:46.359
Alright.

232
00:19:47.079 --> 00:19:49.559
We still have a lot of time
to eat together.

233
00:19:51.799 --> 00:19:52.839
Right?

234
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:56.319
Mmm. Right.

235
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:25.170
Ah.

236
00:20:26.119 --> 00:20:28.240
- You're Cindy?
- That's right.

237
00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:32.319
I'm sorry for being late.
The traffic was really bad.

238
00:20:32.319 --> 00:20:34.079
It's okay.

239
00:20:34.759 --> 00:20:37.920
I took the liberty
to order food for us.

240
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.799
I hope you like it.

241
00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:43.240
I usually order for myself.

242
00:20:46.359 --> 00:20:47.890
By the way,

243
00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.440
it's a pleasure to meet you.

244
00:20:50.599 --> 00:20:54.319
- Your dad told me a bit about you.
- He did?

245
00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.170
Finally, I get to meet you
in person.

246
00:20:58.839 --> 00:21:00.119
It's a pleasure to meet you.

247
00:21:04.799 --> 00:21:06.000
They're new.

248
00:21:09.359 --> 00:21:10.799
It's strange.

249
00:21:11.519 --> 00:21:13.680
This is the first time we've met.

250
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.119
But why do I feel like we've known
each other for a long time?

251
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.170
You look better than in the photos.

252
00:21:23.279 --> 00:21:27.039
I faceplanted when I was young.
So I grew up to be handsome.

253
00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.039
You're so funny.

254
00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.890
You're easily amused.

255
00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:42.440
I heard you like to travel, right?

256
00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.359
You just went to Tibet.

257
00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:47.319
I like to travel as well.

258
00:21:47.319 --> 00:21:50.480
Last week, I just went to Paris.

259
00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.880
It seems that both of us

260
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.160
will get along much better
than I expected.

261
00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.519
- Speaking of Tibet, do you like it?
- I do.

262
00:21:57.519 --> 00:21:59.759
I hate it. It's so hot there.

263
00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.920
My armpits were so wet and icky.

264
00:22:04.319 --> 00:22:07.319
Paris, are you a fan
of European countries?

265
00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.039
It's such a long flight. How can you
manage without getting bored?

266
00:22:12.759 --> 00:22:14.359
Well, then.

267
00:22:14.359 --> 00:22:16.680
We can go somewhere you like.

268
00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.759
Mmm.

269
00:22:17.759 --> 00:22:18.960
I like traveling in Thailand.

270
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.119
Oh, okay.

271
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.880
During my free time, I...

272
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.960
Stop!

273
00:22:32.319 --> 00:22:33.920
I'm sorry I...

274
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:37.680
About our engagement,

275
00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.160
my dad arranged everything.

276
00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.039
I never knew about it before.

277
00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:46.119
You're beautiful

278
00:22:46.119 --> 00:22:47.480
and lovely.

279
00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.759
Umm...

280
00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:51.200
I have something to tell you.

281
00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:54.880
What is it?

282
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.680
I already have someone that I love.

283
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.160
- Hello, Dad?
- Cindy told me you were terrible.

284
00:23:21.519 --> 00:23:23.200
Dad, hello.

285
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.880
Porsche! Porsche!

286
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.359
- Can you hear me?
- You know what you're going to get.

287
00:23:27.359 --> 00:23:29.920
- Hello? I can't hear you.
- Porsche! Porsche!

288
00:23:45.359 --> 00:23:46.640
Oh, Tan?

289
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.880
Oh.

290
00:23:49.119 --> 00:23:51.440
- Hi.
- You seem tired.

291
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.880
Are you okay?

292
00:23:53.759 --> 00:23:55.680
Oh, I'm fine.

293
00:23:56.519 --> 00:23:58.319
Don't forget to get some rest.

294
00:23:58.319 --> 00:24:00.720
I have to go now.
I'll be back tomorrow.

295
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.920
Thank you.

296
00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.960
Rung,

297
00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:40.640
I don't know what to do
about my feelings.

298
00:24:45.359 --> 00:24:48.880
Every time I get closer to her,

299
00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:54.279
I feel like

300
00:24:55.359 --> 00:24:57.240
I'm moving further away from her.

301
00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.000
Can you tell me

302
00:25:04.519 --> 00:25:06.240
what I should do?

303
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.480
Tan!

304
00:26:38.519 --> 00:26:39.960
Tan, come here.

305
00:26:42.799 --> 00:26:43.960
Come on.

306
00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.039
Oh!

307
00:26:48.799 --> 00:26:49.799
Rin.

308
00:26:55.119 --> 00:26:56.559
Nice dress.

309
00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.359
It's a good brand.

310
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.640
I'll go and get something to eat.
I'm hungry.

311
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.960
No rush.

312
00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:36.200
I thought you weren't going
to wear the suit.

313
00:27:36.839 --> 00:27:39.119
You look very nice in it.

314
00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:43.880
You designed it well.

315
00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.039
Thanks.

316
00:27:55.559 --> 00:27:58.119
I'm sorry about the other day.

317
00:27:59.319 --> 00:28:00.920
I was being a bit silly.

318
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.599
It wasn't a bit.

319
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:05.839
You were being very silly.

320
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.960
You're no different.

321
00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:09.880
Why?

322
00:28:11.119 --> 00:28:14.440
How can you think that

323
00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:17.799
there's something going on
between Primrose and me?

324
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.599
How can I possibly know

325
00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:24.799
if you and her really
have something?

326
00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:28.079
Are you jealous?

327
00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.559
No.

328
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.880
I'm just confused.

329
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.519
I don't know how I should treat you.

330
00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:45.880
I don't understand.

331
00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.079
You seemed to care about me
all of a sudden.

332
00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:54.319
And then you were mean to me.

333
00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:57.480
And you distanced yourself
and were nice to another woman.

334
00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.519
Now you're being nice to me again.

335
00:29:02.119 --> 00:29:04.359
And yesterday you threw a fit at me.

336
00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:07.720
I'm confused.

337
00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.079
I'm so confused about everything.

338
00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:14.240
I feel like I know you and I don't.

339
00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.640
Who are you, really?

340
00:29:24.079 --> 00:29:25.559
I'll tell you.

341
00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:29.440
I'm a silly person.

342
00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.039
Because I'm also confused
about how you treat me.

343
00:29:34.519 --> 00:29:35.920
I'm crazy

344
00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.720
because I keep thinking about
whether you're happy or sad

345
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.960
when we're together.

346
00:29:43.319 --> 00:29:44.960
I'm selfish

347
00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.720
because I don't want anyone
to be close to you

348
00:29:49.799 --> 00:29:50.960
except me.

349
00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.720
And...

350
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.079
And I'm just a guy

351
00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.519
who doesn't know what to do
to be good enough

352
00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.559
to be with you.

353
00:30:12.559 --> 00:30:13.599
Tan.

354
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.039
The question you've
all been waiting for.

355
00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:28.880
Who started flirting first?

356
00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.720
A glass of red wine, please.

357
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:36.680
Wow!

358
00:30:41.759 --> 00:30:44.200
What's wrong? Why the long face?

359
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.759
Isn't it your sister's wedding?

360
00:30:48.519 --> 00:30:51.440
I'm about to do
the most important thing in my life.

361
00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.240
But I don't know
if I'll be able to pull it off.

362
00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.680
Then,

363
00:31:00.359 --> 00:31:02.279
I wish you luck.

364
00:31:25.799 --> 00:31:27.960
- I'd like something strong.
- Yes, sir.

365
00:31:37.039 --> 00:31:38.680
- Another one, please.
- Yes, sir.

366
00:31:41.119 --> 00:31:42.200
Tan,

367
00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:45.359
slow down.
We're at a wedding.

368
00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.559
I'm about to do
the most important thing in my life.

369
00:31:50.279 --> 00:31:51.920
But I don't know
if I'll be able to pull it off.

370
00:31:54.119 --> 00:31:57.200
Then, I wish you luck.

371
00:32:14.079 --> 00:32:16.000
Shoot. It's a deja vu.

372
00:32:16.559 --> 00:32:18.839
It's the most important moment now.

373
00:32:18.839 --> 00:32:21.799
Girls, gather around in the front.

374
00:32:21.799 --> 00:32:24.680
Are you coming? Come on!

375
00:32:25.079 --> 00:32:28.400
It's the most important moment now.

376
00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:30.400
Are you ready?

377
00:32:32.039 --> 00:32:34.920
Okay. The audience is ready.

378
00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.759
Are the people
on the stage ready?

379
00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:45.119
Alright. One, two, three. Go!

380
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.839
What's this?

381
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.359
Me?

382
00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:10.279
I'd like to invite the lucky woman
on stage, please.

383
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.440
Rin.

384
00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.799
Can I have a word?

385
00:33:27.559 --> 00:33:29.039
You look very beautiful tonight.

386
00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.920
Of course.

387
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.519
Do you remember what I asked you?

388
00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:43.000
I'm here for the answer.

389
00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.759
Can you give it to me now?

390
00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.359
I know I've proposed
to you plenty of times already.

391
00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:02.440
But tonight,
it's going to be the last.

392
00:34:03.319 --> 00:34:05.960
And I want it to be
the last time for me

393
00:34:06.839 --> 00:34:08.880
and the last time
for the both of us.

394
00:34:45.329 --> 00:34:46.840
Marry me, Rin.

395
00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:53.880
Porsche.

396
00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:58.809
I only think of you as a brother.

397
00:35:00.329 --> 00:35:01.329
Rin,

398
00:35:01.519 --> 00:35:04.769
there's no need to rush.
You can think for a bit.

399
00:35:05.159 --> 00:35:06.440
- I intend to...
- Porsche!

400
00:35:11.519 --> 00:35:12.519
I...

401
00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:15.769
I've thought about it carefully.

402
00:35:17.039 --> 00:35:19.840
I really think of you as a brother.

403
00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.559
A brother?

404
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.719
Just a brother?

405
00:35:52.239 --> 00:35:53.639
I really care about you!

406
00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.440
I've always been nice to you!

407
00:35:55.639 --> 00:35:57.039
Haven't you thought about it at all?

408
00:36:02.239 --> 00:36:03.599
I love you, Rin.

409
00:36:04.719 --> 00:36:07.000
I love you. Do you hear me?

410
00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:09.329
Rin.

411
00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:32.840
Porsche.

412
00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.960
Don't try anymore.

413
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.769
I'm sorry.

414
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.400
Rin.

415
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.360
Rin, don't go.

416
00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:44.079
Why didn't you accept?

417
00:38:45.719 --> 00:38:48.119
You two seem like a good fit.

418
00:38:49.519 --> 00:38:51.329
You're a famous designer.

419
00:38:51.679 --> 00:38:52.960
He's an entrepreneur.

420
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.639
Even though I don't know
what kind of business he does,

421
00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.039
if you were with him,

422
00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.639
you'd probably be happy
for the rest of your life.

423
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.199
I think

424
00:39:10.329 --> 00:39:11.880
there's nothing better than...

425
00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.159
Do you like me?

426
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.400
Tanthai?

427
00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.519
Do you like me?

428
00:39:29.519 --> 00:39:31.440
Weren't you listening
to what I said?

429
00:39:32.329 --> 00:39:34.199
My feelings are not important.

430
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:37.239
It's your feelings that...

431
00:39:37.239 --> 00:39:38.239
I don't care.

432
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.599
Do you like me?

433
00:40:13.079 --> 00:40:14.360
I love you.

434
00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.840
I really do love you.

435
00:40:23.679 --> 00:40:24.769
Rin,

436
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:28.360
I don't know when it started.

437
00:40:29.039 --> 00:40:30.599
But now that I know,

438
00:40:30.809 --> 00:40:33.159
I never want to lose you
to anyone again.

439
00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.079
What about you?

440
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.480
What do you think about me?

441
00:40:43.159 --> 00:40:44.960
I love you too.

442
00:41:46.289 --> 00:41:47.639
You're so beautiful.

443
00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:50.159
What's up with you?

444
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.440
How come
you're complimenting me now?

445
00:41:54.119 --> 00:41:57.769
I can't stop
my own thoughts right now.

446
00:41:58.809 --> 00:42:00.360
Actually,

447
00:42:01.079 --> 00:42:04.599
I can't control
my own thoughts either.

448
00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:08.880
My feelings

449
00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:11.159
are really chaotic right now.

450
00:42:12.159 --> 00:42:14.519
I don't know

451
00:42:14.679 --> 00:42:16.400
what I should do.

452
00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:19.679
Then,

453
00:42:20.159 --> 00:42:21.480
let's

454
00:42:21.769 --> 00:42:23.440
run away together.

455
00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.719
Run away?

456
00:42:26.639 --> 00:42:27.880
To where?

457
00:42:31.039 --> 00:42:34.360
To a place where both of us
won't have to think.

458
00:42:35.079 --> 00:42:37.639
We can let our hearts decide.

459
00:42:44.289 --> 00:42:46.920
Mmm. Let's go.

460
00:43:31.289 --> 00:43:33.559
Two missed calls from the agency.

461
00:43:33.719 --> 00:43:35.239
It's nine o'clock already?

462
00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.400
Hello, Nid.

463
00:43:39.519 --> 00:43:40.559
Okay.

464
00:43:41.159 --> 00:43:42.599
It's confirmed.

465
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.280
Two in the afternoon?

466
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.920
I'll ask Tan first.

467
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.480
Okay. Goodbye.

468
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.320
Porsche,

469
00:43:57.159 --> 00:43:58.480
it's time to get up.

470
00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:00.920
Hey.

471
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:06.840
What?

472
00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.000
I thought I...

473
00:44:12.639 --> 00:44:13.920
No need to be serious.

474
00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:16.559
- The shirt!
- You.

475
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.480
The bra!

476
00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.480
Me.

477
00:44:19.719 --> 00:44:21.559
- We...
- Slept together.

478
00:44:21.679 --> 00:44:23.159
Oh, shoot.

479
00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.840
What? Don't you remember?

480
00:44:28.159 --> 00:44:29.440
I'm sad, you know?

481
00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:36.960
Last night

482
00:44:38.039 --> 00:44:39.400
was quite fun,

483
00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.039
Mr. Producer.

484
00:44:46.159 --> 00:44:47.440
I'm ready.

485
00:45:02.159 --> 00:45:03.559
I know where Rarin is now.

486
00:45:03.559 --> 00:45:04.920
She went to her mom's place
in Khao Yai.

487
00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.320
- Mom.
- Help!

488
00:45:08.119 --> 00:45:09.519
Help me!

489
00:45:09.519 --> 00:45:12.480
I dreamed of the first day we met.

490
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.760
But you weren't there.

491
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.079
No matter where you disappear to,

492
00:45:17.079 --> 00:45:18.559
I'm going to find you.

493
00:45:18.559 --> 00:45:19.679
I love Rin.

494
00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.039
Do you hear me?

495
00:45:21.039 --> 00:45:22.960
But shouldn't you just stop
once you've tried hard enough?

496
00:45:23.239 --> 00:45:25.960
Rarin, can you still hear a voice

497
00:45:26.119 --> 00:45:28.079
every time it rains?
