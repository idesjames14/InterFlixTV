00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.280
Porsch,

2
00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:46.040
this is your wedding invitation.

3
00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.519
Is it beautiful? Here.

4
00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.480
Thanks.

5
00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:02.560
I know you don't want to get married

6
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.879
but you can't refuse.

7
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.319
I also want you to be
with the person you love.

8
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.960
I'm married. I know

9
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.960
how important choosing
your life partner is.

10
00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.680
But Dad meant well

11
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.919
when he chose one for you.

12
00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:29.840
Don't worry about me.

13
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.530
I'll probably love her eventually
after we get married.

14
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.960
I'm happy you came
to that conclusion.

15
00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:46.240
I have to go now.

16
00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:27.199
This one is still fine.

17
00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.120
Okay.

18
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.199
You're here too?

19
00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.479
I didn't know there was a fire
at the studio last night.

20
00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:40.960
I was so shocked when I arrived.

21
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.159
And where's Rin now?

22
00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:56.039
Throw this one away separately.

23
00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.879
We got here and saw her like this.

24
00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.400
This one's still okay.

25
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.719
She didn't explain anything to us.

26
00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:11.080
So we don't know what to do.

27
00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:17.439
Keep this one.

28
00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:22.759
Rin, what are you doing?

29
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.079
I'm sorting the clothes
damaged by the fire.

30
00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:29.610
I know.

31
00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:33.279
But I want to know if you've rested.

32
00:04:33.519 --> 00:04:35.610
I don't have time for that.

33
00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:38.120
There are still many things
to deal with.

34
00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:44.240
Hello. Are you Rarin?
I'm here to do the repair work.

35
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.730
Yes.

36
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.480
Hello.

37
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.759
- Can you see the fire damage there?
- Yes.

38
00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:51.920
Please follow me.

39
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.120
- That's a lot of damage.
- I need it fixed right away.

40
00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:56.839
This way, please.

41
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.399
Okay. Take good care of her.

42
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.050
Now go.

43
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.170
What's the matter?

44
00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.079
Tan and Rarin
confronted Sao last night

45
00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:18.240
and they convinced her
to turn herself in.

46
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.170
But a fire broke out
at Rin's studio.

47
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.120
- A fire?
- Mmm.

48
00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:24.730
Did anyone get hurt?

49
00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:28.199
I don't know.
Tan's helping Rin right now.

50
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.240
Hello, Mind.

51
00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.600
Is Porsch here?

52
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.800
No, he's not.

53
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.480
Did something happen?

54
00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.040
He disappeared from home.

55
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.720
He left his phone

56
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.480
and didn't take his wallet with him.

57
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.959
I know that when he was
kicked out last time,

58
00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:55.439
he stayed here.

59
00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:57.120
So I thought I'd check here first.

60
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.560
If you see him, please call me.

61
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.160
Sure.

62
00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:20.399
You're worried about him,
aren't you?

63
00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:24.079
A little.

64
00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:25.519
- But...
- Alright.

65
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.839
Can you give me a lift
to Rarin's studio?

66
00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.480
Mmm.

67
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.079
If we cut here

68
00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:39.560
and sew the fabric together,
it should be okay.

69
00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:42.000
- Is that really a good idea?
- Of course it is.

70
00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:49.319
Rin, that's enough.

71
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.040
Let go of me.

72
00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:55.920
Rin, enough.

73
00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:59.160
You have to get a hold of yourself,
do you know that?

74
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.000
I'm in complete control.

75
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.560
Rin.

76
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.199
You're confused right now.

77
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.360
You have to rest.

78
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.240
You shouldn't be doing this.

79
00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.360
Things will get worse
if you're not mindful.

80
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.480
You're making things worse.

81
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.079
Don't you see that I'm trying
to fix the problem?

82
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.920
You don't think you can
fix these clothes, do you?

83
00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:49.839
Rung?

84
00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:51.560
How did you get here?

85
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.800
Mind gave me a lift.

86
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.959
These clothes are impossible to fix.

87
00:07:58.319 --> 00:08:00.639
As a fashion designer,

88
00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:05.399
you wouldn't want people to wear
these imperfect clothes, would you?

89
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.040
Rin?

90
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.600
Rung.

91
00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.399
It's okay to be sad, Rin.

92
00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:40.600
I used to feel the same way.

93
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.559
But look at me now,

94
00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:50.330
I got through it.

95
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.090
Just don't forget
that you're not fighting alone.

96
00:10:01.399 --> 00:10:03.519
There are others helping you.

97
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:32.879
Sometimes allowing yourself
to feel sad

98
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.600
can also be a sign of strength.

99
00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:35.440
Attention. Flight EG461

100
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.639
is ready for departure.

101
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.320
Hey.

102
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:59.240
Attention. Flight EG461

103
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.080
is ready for departure.

104
00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.519
How did you know that I was here?

105
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.440
Didn't you say that you wanted
to go on an adventure?

106
00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:08.919
So I made a wild guess.

107
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.240
And I was right.

108
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.639
You're more clever
than my subordinates.

109
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.440
Aren't you going to go home?

110
00:12:18.799 --> 00:12:20.320
Praew's looking for you.

111
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.159
I know.

112
00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:26.399
I just want to try to imagine

113
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.960
a different life.

114
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.519
I get to live far away,

115
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.440
do things myself

116
00:12:39.919 --> 00:12:41.480
and I'm going to be proud of it.

117
00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:52.480
But there's probably
no chance of that.

118
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.919
Come on. Let's go.

119
00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:06.399
Porsch.

120
00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:09.960
Let's go.

121
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.480
You're not here to take me home?

122
00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:18.360
Who said I was here
to take you home?

123
00:13:31.919 --> 00:13:33.480
How come we ended up here?

124
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.200
It was the closest flight.

125
00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.159
I wanted to take you
somewhere further,

126
00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:38.720
but I forgot my passport.

127
00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:41.039
I didn't want to come here.

128
00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:43.159
Oh, don't you want
to live your life?

129
00:13:43.159 --> 00:13:44.519
- I do, but...
- Come on!

130
00:13:44.519 --> 00:13:46.600
- What? The coconut!
- Hurry!

131
00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.960
It's wet.

132
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.840
We're at the beach.
Of course it's wet.

133
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.399
- The sun is too hot!
- It's not!

134
00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:55.080
It's not. Come on!

135
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.159
One, two, three!

136
00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.120
Oops!

137
00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:22.679
Look at that. It's...

138
00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:26.840
One, two, three.

139
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.559
Okay, horizontal now.

140
00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:41.399
How is it? Did you have fun today?

141
00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:44.519
So-so.

142
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.600
Tight-lipped. If you had fun,
just say so.

143
00:14:49.399 --> 00:14:50.879
I'm scared that if I say so,

144
00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:53.159
time will fly away too quickly.

145
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.120
We've escaped this far.
Don't overthink it.

146
00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:02.559
We still can't escape reality.

147
00:15:03.559 --> 00:15:04.559
Is that right?

148
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.759
Maybe your heart doesn't want to?

149
00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.480
What do you mean?

150
00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.720
Like,

151
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:16.440
when you were persistent with Rarin.

152
00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:20.519
Even though you know
Rarin thinks of you as a brother,

153
00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:21.960
you were still fixated on her.

154
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.279
I'm not like that.

155
00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:28.240
As for Rin,

156
00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:30.399
I've already moved on.

157
00:15:31.039 --> 00:15:32.159
Really?

158
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.840
You don't believe me?

159
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:36.799
Alright. I'll believe you.
Good for you.

160
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.759
Your expression betrays you.

161
00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:41.600
If you don't believe me,

162
00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.360
do you want me to prove it?

163
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:44.960
How?

164
00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:05.519
Porsch,

165
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.320
we've been told to take you home.

166
00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:15.559
How did you know we were here?

167
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.399
Praew went to see you, didn't she?

168
00:16:18.879 --> 00:16:19.879
She did.

169
00:16:21.039 --> 00:16:22.679
You don't know my family
well enough.

170
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.799
What's up with them?

171
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.480
I guess

172
00:16:30.799 --> 00:16:32.240
fun time is over.

173
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.559
Thanks for today.

174
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.960
Please, sir.

175
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.200
Run!

176
00:16:45.679 --> 00:16:47.480
After them! Go!

177
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.440
Where did they go? Check over there!

178
00:16:59.799 --> 00:17:00.840
Out of the way, please!

179
00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.720
Excuse me, can you take
a photo for us?

180
00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:05.410
Alright!

181
00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.410
Where are we going?

182
00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:09.240
- Wait!
- This way!

183
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:10.440
Wait! Where are we going?

184
00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:13.119
Thank you.

185
00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:17.650
Ugh!

186
00:17:19.279 --> 00:17:20.319
- Where are we going?
- This way!

187
00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:25.960
- I'm sorry!
- Sorry!

188
00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:28.599
Can't you see? After them!

189
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:37.240
Hold on!

190
00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.480
Come on!

191
00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.240
I've found Porsch, sir.

192
00:18:06.079 --> 00:18:07.079
Porsch,

193
00:18:08.759 --> 00:18:10.240
your father would like to
have a word with you.

194
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.890
Are you having fun on your trip?

195
00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.799
Hurry back home
once you've had enough.

196
00:18:17.359 --> 00:18:19.680
Fulfill your duty
as the son of our family

197
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.410
and as my son too!

198
00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:55.319
Are you feeling better now?

199
00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.200
I am.

200
00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:01.119
That's a relief.

201
00:19:01.519 --> 00:19:04.240
You looked really crazed just now.
Do you know that?

202
00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.240
I'm not crazy.

203
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.519
You wouldn't listen to anyone.

204
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.410
It was like you had the weight of
the world on your shoulders.

205
00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:13.559
You looked so scary.

206
00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:15.319
You're exaggerating.

207
00:19:15.599 --> 00:19:16.890
Well, it's true.

208
00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:19.119
Tan, Rin, can you come over here?

209
00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.890
What's the matter?

210
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:30.200
Since Rin's resting today,

211
00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.960
I'd like to kill time
by doing something.

212
00:19:34.119 --> 00:19:36.720
I made a women's outfit

213
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.799
and I want to give it to Rin.

214
00:19:38.799 --> 00:19:42.079
But I'm not sure if it'll fit her.

215
00:19:42.279 --> 00:19:43.890
So I'd like to take
her measurements.

216
00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:46.480
An outfit for me?

217
00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:47.920
Mmm.

218
00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.960
Do you have a measuring tape?

219
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.799
I do.

220
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.279
What are you doing?

221
00:20:00.839 --> 00:20:01.839
You'll see.

222
00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.410
Here you go.

223
00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:17.759
But I still don't feel strong.

224
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.720
Can you help me, Tan?

225
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.839
I'll write it down.

226
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.440
- Me?
- Yes.

227
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.599
Alright. Let's start
with the shoulders.

228
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.839
Shoulders, 16.

229
00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:58.200
What's next?

230
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.519
The neck.

231
00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:04.559
Okay.

232
00:21:09.759 --> 00:21:11.650
Neck, 12.

233
00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:13.720
And

234
00:21:14.519 --> 00:21:15.759
go downwards.

235
00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.200
From here?

236
00:21:20.079 --> 00:21:21.079
Mmm.

237
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.960
It's 12 and 23.

238
00:21:30.319 --> 00:21:31.519
You know how to do it.

239
00:21:34.079 --> 00:21:35.079
What about the head?

240
00:21:49.079 --> 00:21:51.279
I feel so guilty
for bringing you here.

241
00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.519
I'm sorry.

242
00:21:55.799 --> 00:21:58.440
This one's not going home.

243
00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.400
What did you call yourself?

244
00:22:02.519 --> 00:22:04.720
Why? I said "this one."

245
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.279
Aren't you afraid of being cut off?

246
00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.160
I am.

247
00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:20.920
Usually when I do something,
I have to rely on Dad.

248
00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.160
I solve problems with money.

249
00:22:24.839 --> 00:22:28.680
I don't know if I'll survive
if Dad doesn't help me.

250
00:22:31.319 --> 00:22:33.119
But after I came out
here with you...

251
00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.160
How should I say this?

252
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.160
It...

253
00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.880
It makes me feel

254
00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.279
- stronger.
- Stronger.

255
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.799
I'm going to the bathroom.

256
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.039
Mind,

257
00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.200
I have something to ask of you.

258
00:24:09.359 --> 00:24:12.720
Mind, wait for me here.
I'll be back.

259
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.720
Where are you going?

260
00:24:14.039 --> 00:24:15.240
Come on. I won't be long.

261
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.680
I'm sorry.

262
00:25:04.839 --> 00:25:06.480
I didn't want it
to turn out this way.

263
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.319
I'm talking here.

264
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.440
You won't be able to hear it.

265
00:25:20.279 --> 00:25:23.640
I'm not good at showing
my true feelings.

266
00:25:27.519 --> 00:25:29.039
I want you

267
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.720
to know about my feelings.

268
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.079
But if I do it,

269
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.680
it will be too selfish of me.

270
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:49.519
I don't know what to do.

271
00:25:54.279 --> 00:25:55.640
I'm sorry.

272
00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:19.279
What?

273
00:26:19.799 --> 00:26:21.079
Hold out your hand.

274
00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.559
I bought it for you.

275
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.319
It's a shame

276
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.440
that the lady only had one for sale.

277
00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:42.480
If only there were two,

278
00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.519
I would've bought one for myself
to wear.

279
00:26:44.519 --> 00:26:47.079
So you won't have to be lonely.

280
00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:53.319
Mind,

281
00:26:55.079 --> 00:26:56.319
did I say something wrong?

282
00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.319
Why are you crying?

283
00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:05.119
Why are you crying?

284
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.440
- I'm not.
- Don't like it? I can return it.

285
00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.880
No, it's lovely.

286
00:27:11.599 --> 00:27:12.880
Hey! Hey!

287
00:27:13.839 --> 00:27:14.839
What is this?

288
00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.279
Thank you, Mind.

289
00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.279
You'll be handsomely rewarded.

290
00:27:23.319 --> 00:27:24.599
Why did you do this?

291
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.200
Let go of me!

292
00:27:29.519 --> 00:27:31.119
I gave you my heart!

293
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.680
What are you going to get from this?

294
00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:39.799
Let go!

295
00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:56.839
Thank you.

296
00:28:35.599 --> 00:28:36.880
You're a grown-up,

297
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.920
but you still can't tell right
from wrong.

298
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.920
Why do you like causing trouble?

299
00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.680
Alright.

300
00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:48.079
Let's wait until you're married.

301
00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.759
You can cheat
or do whatever you want.

302
00:28:51.759 --> 00:28:52.759
Shut up!

303
00:28:56.839 --> 00:28:58.759
Initially, I was going to
get married like you said.

304
00:28:59.359 --> 00:29:01.480
But you disrespected my woman!

305
00:29:01.759 --> 00:29:02.960
Do you know her?

306
00:29:03.359 --> 00:29:05.640
You don't even know her! Cheating?

307
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.759
That's all you can think about?

308
00:29:06.759 --> 00:29:08.160
Okay, okay.

309
00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.799
I don't care whoever it is.

310
00:29:12.279 --> 00:29:13.440
I'm only asking you

311
00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:15.920
to stop running after women
like you used to do.

312
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.319
Be mature.

313
00:29:20.039 --> 00:29:22.039
Okay? And we'll talk later.

314
00:29:23.279 --> 00:29:24.480
I'm not going to get married.

315
00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:34.240
You're kidding, aren't you?

316
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.160
You have money to spend every day

317
00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.200
because of whom?

318
00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.200
Do you think you're going to survive
by walking out of here

319
00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.079
and finding your own place?

320
00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.119
Have you ever thought about

321
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.279
why I raised you this way?

322
00:29:57.519 --> 00:30:01.200
So you have to live a life that's
dependant on someone!

323
00:30:03.119 --> 00:30:06.680
You have to listen and rely on me!

324
00:30:08.319 --> 00:30:11.240
You will never fly out of this nest

325
00:30:12.319 --> 00:30:15.119
if I don't teach you how to fly.

326
00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:35.920
From this day on,

327
00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:43.680
you're not my father anymore.

328
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:47.759
Porsch!

329
00:30:50.039 --> 00:30:51.240
What did you say?

330
00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:54.599
From this day on,

331
00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.279
you are not

332
00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.279
my father anymore.

333
00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:04.039
You can go ahead and
take me out of the will.

334
00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:06.279
I won't take any orders from you!

335
00:31:07.839 --> 00:31:10.799
- I should be the one who says that!
- So what?

336
00:31:15.319 --> 00:31:18.319
I'm severing my ties to the family
before you do!

337
00:31:19.519 --> 00:31:20.559
Got a problem with that?

338
00:31:36.319 --> 00:31:37.480
What are you doing?

339
00:31:38.359 --> 00:31:39.759
Bring him back here!

340
00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:41.799
Go!

341
00:31:53.279 --> 00:31:54.319
Stay back!

342
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.400
Praew.

343
00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.559
Go, Porsch. I'll talk to Dad.

344
00:32:11.039 --> 00:32:14.279
If anyone dares to get
in my brother's way,

345
00:32:15.359 --> 00:32:17.039
don't say I didn't warn you.

346
00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.160
You can go now.

347
00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.359
Thanks, dear sister.

348
00:33:44.839 --> 00:33:45.839
Porsch!

349
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.920
Mind?

350
00:33:51.319 --> 00:33:52.440
How did you get here?

351
00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.000
I ran away from home.

352
00:33:56.599 --> 00:33:57.599
What did you say?

353
00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.759
In Phuket, why did you do that?

354
00:34:04.519 --> 00:34:06.480
I did it for your own happiness.

355
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.960
Isn't it better
for you to stay home?

356
00:34:08.769 --> 00:34:09.960
Do you really think so?

357
00:34:12.769 --> 00:34:14.880
I don't know
if I'm going to survive.

358
00:34:15.329 --> 00:34:17.239
My family usually helps me.

359
00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:19.809
But my happiness isn't there now.

360
00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.880
It's in front of me.

361
00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.199
What are you blabbering about?

362
00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:31.809
I'm not.

363
00:34:34.039 --> 00:34:35.039
I'm telling the truth.

364
00:34:39.289 --> 00:34:41.329
You're the stupidest rich kid
I've ever seen.

365
00:34:43.329 --> 00:34:44.329
Why are you insulting me?

366
00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.769
You're the stupidest beautiful woman
I've ever seen as well.

367
00:34:46.769 --> 00:34:47.880
Why are you insulting me?

368
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.119
Well, you insulted me first.

369
00:34:50.769 --> 00:34:52.289
So, we're both stupid then?

370
00:34:54.769 --> 00:34:55.769
I guess so.

371
00:35:01.719 --> 00:35:03.519
I have something to ask you.

372
00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.960
Fire away.

373
00:35:08.159 --> 00:35:09.199
What do you think of me?

374
00:35:13.159 --> 00:35:14.519
Well,

375
00:35:15.239 --> 00:35:16.440
what do you think of me?

376
00:35:17.039 --> 00:35:19.159
- I asked you first.
- You answer first.

377
00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.880
Ladies first.

378
00:35:23.159 --> 00:35:24.559
- Okay.
- Mmm.

379
00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.000
That night...

380
00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:34.329
- What night?
- Well, that night.

381
00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:37.480
You asked me if I really
don't have any feelings for you.

382
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.960
I didn't initially.

383
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.400
But...

384
00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.920
But now that I've gotten
to know you more,

385
00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.199
I don't want to let you be alone.

386
00:35:57.719 --> 00:35:59.039
I want to take care,

387
00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.679
protect,

388
00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:04.239
and stay beside you.

389
00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.400
I don't know when it happened.

390
00:36:10.159 --> 00:36:13.119
Once I realized it,
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

391
00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:23.119
What about you?

392
00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.480
- Likewise.
- Huh?

393
00:36:27.639 --> 00:36:28.880
Likewise.

394
00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.599
- Just one word?
- Why should I say more?

395
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.639
My feelings need to be described
in more than one word.

396
00:36:35.639 --> 00:36:37.599
It's possible. You can just say...

397
00:36:38.639 --> 00:36:39.920
that you love me. That's all.

398
00:36:40.239 --> 00:36:41.639
Oh, that's all.

399
00:36:41.809 --> 00:36:42.809
Right.

400
00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.679
Can you give me an example?

401
00:36:48.519 --> 00:36:49.679
Umm...

402
00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:52.289
Je t'aime.

403
00:36:52.809 --> 00:36:56.000
See? In French.

404
00:36:56.769 --> 00:36:58.079
Saranghae.

405
00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.079
I-I love you.

406
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:02.719
Mmm.

407
00:37:03.079 --> 00:37:04.639
You're Thai. You should speak Thai.

408
00:37:13.289 --> 00:37:14.329
Porsch...

409
00:37:15.329 --> 00:37:16.440
rak Mind na.

410
00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:23.960
And

411
00:37:24.559 --> 00:37:25.559
what about you?

412
00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.639
- Hmm?
- Come on.

413
00:37:28.639 --> 00:37:30.440
- Me?
- Mmm.

414
00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:33.559
I have a better one.

415
00:37:34.809 --> 00:37:35.809
Go on.

416
00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.239
Will you marry me?

417
00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.289
What did you say?

418
00:37:49.639 --> 00:37:50.679
Let's get married.

419
00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.079
I didn't hear it correctly.

420
00:37:54.079 --> 00:37:55.329
- Do you want to or not?
- I do!

421
00:38:55.239 --> 00:38:56.239
Why are you staring at me?

422
00:39:17.639 --> 00:39:18.809
I found it in front of the house.

423
00:39:21.519 --> 00:39:22.519
Porsch.

424
00:39:28.039 --> 00:39:29.079
I won't go down on my knees.

425
00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.159
There's no need.

426
00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.809
Put it on now.

427
00:39:32.809 --> 00:39:34.400
- Umm...
- Come on.

428
00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:36.440
There's no, like, fireworks?

429
00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.809
Just put it on.

430
00:39:38.039 --> 00:39:39.769
Put it on. There.

431
00:39:40.769 --> 00:39:42.199
- That's all?
- Mmm.

432
00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.199
Don't you have
to go down on your knees?

433
00:39:47.079 --> 00:39:48.079
You're lovely.

434
00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.000
What should we do next?

435
00:39:57.639 --> 00:39:58.809
I don't have a place
to live anymore.

436
00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.159
You can live here with me.

437
00:40:02.559 --> 00:40:04.159
But don't fight with Tan too often.

438
00:40:06.119 --> 00:40:08.809
Even if it's daily, I'm okay
if I get to be with you every day.

439
00:40:08.809 --> 00:40:10.199
- No fights!
- Yes, ma'am.

440
00:40:12.719 --> 00:40:14.519
- Let's go inside.
- Yes, ma'am.

441
00:40:17.039 --> 00:40:18.159
A cursed ring.

442
00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.960
What a shame.

443
00:40:27.639 --> 00:40:29.719
We spent so much time on this.

444
00:40:35.679 --> 00:40:38.039
Fashion Week is also approaching.

445
00:40:40.239 --> 00:40:42.239
But we still have
the original pattern.

446
00:40:43.519 --> 00:40:44.960
If we help each other,

447
00:40:45.440 --> 00:40:46.769
I think we'll finish it in time.

448
00:40:53.039 --> 00:40:55.159
There's one more that's not singed.

449
00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.039
Is that the jacket I wore?

450
00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.920
That's right.

451
00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:18.239
This was the first thing I grabbed.

452
00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:21.880
I said to myself,
"I hope he's okay."

453
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.159
And it really was okay.

454
00:41:26.239 --> 00:41:29.679
Come on. Instead of worrying
about yourself first,

455
00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:33.079
you're worried about your designs.

456
00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:36.840
That's right.

457
00:41:37.199 --> 00:41:38.809
I told you

458
00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:41.440
they're like my children,

459
00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:43.960
especially this one.

460
00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:47.559
I put a lot of extra effort
to make it.

461
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:53.639
And for this year's Fashion Week,

462
00:41:53.769 --> 00:41:56.809
I'm going to transform you into
the most perfect prince possible.

463
00:41:56.809 --> 00:41:58.440
Everyone's jaw is going to drop.

464
00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.039
Silly girl.

465
00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:04.559
You have to do it for others too.

466
00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.599
Why would you only do it for me?

467
00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.880
It's my intention.

468
00:42:12.159 --> 00:42:14.679
I'm just a clothing model.

469
00:42:15.159 --> 00:42:18.769
In the end, the people are the ones
who are going to buy them to wear.

470
00:42:19.239 --> 00:42:20.329
Alright.

471
00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:24.599
I'm going to make
a special outfit for you.

472
00:42:25.599 --> 00:42:27.769
There will be only one in the world.

473
00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:31.840
An outfit made for Tanthai

474
00:42:32.039 --> 00:42:34.639
and intended for Tanthai.

475
00:42:37.809 --> 00:42:39.039
There's going to be only one?

476
00:42:40.599 --> 00:42:42.239
Is it going to look strange?

477
00:42:43.289 --> 00:42:45.119
No, it won't.

478
00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.480
Okay.

479
00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:50.119
I'm looking forward to it.

480
00:42:51.559 --> 00:42:52.559
Alright.

481
00:42:56.199 --> 00:42:57.769
Porsch is going to live with us
for a while.

482
00:42:59.769 --> 00:43:01.199
What's going on with Porsch?

483
00:43:01.199 --> 00:43:03.960
What is this? Are you going to
camp out here again?

484
00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.159
What? What?

485
00:43:05.159 --> 00:43:07.480
If Mind wasn't living here,
I wouldn't be here.

486
00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.360
You're being cheeky again!
Get out now!

487
00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.119
- Enough!
- Enough!

488
00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.880
See? He started it.

489
00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.159
So many times already.

490
00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:16.809
- Porsch!
- Yes, ma'am?

491
00:43:16.809 --> 00:43:19.519
You promised me you weren't going to
start a fight with him.

492
00:43:19.519 --> 00:43:21.360
You saw him. He started it.

493
00:43:21.769 --> 00:43:22.769
Okay.

494
00:43:23.239 --> 00:43:24.519
You too, Tan.

495
00:43:24.639 --> 00:43:26.360
Why did you start a fight with him?

496
00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:28.199
You have to be on my side.

497
00:43:28.519 --> 00:43:30.289
I'm not going to side with anyone.

498
00:43:30.289 --> 00:43:32.480
Porsch is my friend. As for you...

499
00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:34.400
What?

500
00:43:36.119 --> 00:43:37.880
Don't be so out of control.

501
00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.639
Why did you say that?

502
00:43:39.639 --> 00:43:42.800
You both look like you're going
to be scared of your future wives.

503
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.239
It's truly the age of women.

504
00:43:44.239 --> 00:43:45.920
That's right.

505
00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.400
Women and men are equal
in this day and age.

506
00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.119
Women don't always
have to do housework, right?

507
00:43:52.159 --> 00:43:54.440
You don't have to, Mind.
I'll be the homemaker.

508
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.039
I'll cook dinner then.

509
00:43:56.039 --> 00:43:57.400
- Hey!
- Don't!

510
00:43:57.639 --> 00:43:59.840
You're not allowed to cook
in my house.

511
00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.440
No need to worry.

512
00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:04.440
I graduated from Le Cordon Bleu.
I've read a lot of reviews.

513
00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.559
I'll get to it!

514
00:44:05.559 --> 00:44:07.880
- Porsch!
- Porsch, stop!

515
00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:09.960
Let go!

516
00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:11.960
I'll do it for you.

517
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.960
Who's going to believe you
with only this much evidence?

518
00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.440
Let's find a way
to get the voice back.

519
00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:57.719
I love you!

520
00:44:57.719 --> 00:44:59.519
I love you too!

521
00:44:59.639 --> 00:45:03.119
Between me and your prince,

522
00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:04.880
who do you love more?

523
00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.159
I intended to talk to you, Rung.

524
00:45:08.159 --> 00:45:09.880
There's news about our brand

525
00:45:10.079 --> 00:45:11.920
copying another brand.

526
00:45:12.039 --> 00:45:15.599
It wasn't me who stole and gave
Rarin's design to Posey.

527
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.840
Why did these bad things
happen to me?
