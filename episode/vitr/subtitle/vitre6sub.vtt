00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.680
What are you doing?

2
00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:01.879
Oh.

3
00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.519
Well...

4
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.040
I saw that you were busy,

5
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.840
so I didn't want to bother you.

6
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.240
Are you hungry?

7
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.599
No.

8
00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:15.840
Well, I am.

9
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.639
Just in time.

10
00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.280
I'm almost done making breakfast.
Do you want to eat together?

11
00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.879
But I haven't brushed my teeth yet.

12
00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.039
So what?

13
00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:29.479
I don't brush my teeth
before breakfast anyway.

14
00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.280
Ew.

15
00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.479
Rin!

16
00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:14.000
Tan told me that you're going
to take a shower. Here.

17
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.520
Here's some clothes.

18
00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.439
Thank you.

19
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.879
The bathroom's this way.

20
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.120
Okay.

21
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.079
What's up with you?

22
00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.240
Uhh, it's nothing.

23
00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.120
Don't look at me like that.

24
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.439
Eat up.

25
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.730
He doesn't usually cook.

26
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.120
If it's just me,

27
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.170
he'll make instant noodles at most.

28
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.720
Hey, this is a double standard!

29
00:05:32.079 --> 00:05:33.160
Are you sick?

30
00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:34.920
Or can't you help yourself?

31
00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.319
Hey, I'm older than you.

32
00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:39.319
I can't even tease you.

33
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.680
By the way,

34
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.560
you're cousins, right?

35
00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:46.240
You two seem close.

36
00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:50.560
I'm an only child.

37
00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:52.920
I'm jealous.

38
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.639
Oh, no. Don't be jealous.

39
00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:57.240
It's such a headache being with him.

40
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.319
You're a pain in the butt too.

41
00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.120
- Especially when we're at uni...
- Hey, hey, hey!

42
00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.279
What? Are you going to let on
something about me?

43
00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.399
You'll burn the house down
if I do it to you.

44
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.839
I'm lucky there's someone
to cook for me.

45
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.000
Shut up and eat.

46
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.519
The three of us haven't
eaten together for a while now.

47
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.439
I'm going to be late.

48
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.839
I have to get going.

49
00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:52.519
Oh?

50
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.920
Are you leaving already?

51
00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:56.639
Yes.

52
00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:58.120
Stay home with Mai.

53
00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.720
If there's anything, just call me.

54
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.199
- See you.
- Okay.

55
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.279
Please get your makeup
and hair done over there.

56
00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:12.279
Okay.

57
00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:15.160
It's not like we've
discussed before.

58
00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:18.720
Can you stop causing
so much trouble?

59
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.480
I already did what you wanted.

60
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.600
Now you're forcing me
to do this kind of thing too?

61
00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:27.199
A no-name celebrity like you.

62
00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:30.240
Do you think you'll be famous
after being in one of my movies?

63
00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:32.079
Your acting is average

64
00:07:32.079 --> 00:07:33.879
and never reliable.

65
00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:37.480
If it wasn't for your body
and looks, you'd be useless.

66
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.480
Even though I'm not skilled yet,

67
00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:43.199
I don't want to start selling it.

68
00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:47.160
I'm not telling you to sell it.

69
00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:49.759
I'm telling you to entertain
the investors.

70
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.800
Wouldn't it be good to get to know
those millionaires?

71
00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:55.959
If you want to keep
moving forward in showbiz,

72
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.000
you should have someone
to support you

73
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.079
and sponsor you. Don't you know?

74
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.519
But I don't want to do
something like that anymore.

75
00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:08.959
Why are you being so stubborn?

76
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.759
Huh?

77
00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:15.959
Do you know that female celebrities

78
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.920
are born every day?

79
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.759
And every day some will expire.

80
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.120
Do you think that you can
always stay at the top?

81
00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:27.959
What did you say?

82
00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:32.639
Let's do it this way.

83
00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:35.639
If you really don't want to do it,

84
00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.519
I have another option for you.

85
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.879
You don't have to entertain
those investors.

86
00:08:45.039 --> 00:08:47.450
Just entertain me. I guarantee

87
00:08:47.639 --> 00:08:49.960
that you'll be rewarded handsomely.

88
00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:52.799
Hey!

89
00:08:58.279 --> 00:08:59.360
Come on. That's enough.

90
00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:01.330
Do you want the crew
to know about this?

91
00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:05.279
Busybody.

92
00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.639
Who told you to butt in?

93
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.360
I didn't want to.

94
00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:15.039
But anyone would step in to help

95
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:17.450
if they saw this.

96
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.210
Next time, don't.

97
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.960
I can look after myself.

98
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.450
Rin, I'm going to the bank.

99
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.679
Can you watch the house?

100
00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:38.360
Of course.

101
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.120
Sorry. I'll be right back.

102
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.090
I'll lock the door.

103
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:44.679
Mai, I'll be okay.

104
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.519
Okay. I'll be right back.

105
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.960
When did I forget this?

106
00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:12.360
Hello, Praew.

107
00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:13.879
Hello, Rin.

108
00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:15.559
Are you with Porsche?

109
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.919
I'm not.

110
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.600
What's going on?

111
00:10:19.799 --> 00:10:21.799
I can't get a hold of him.

112
00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:23.559
So I thought he was with you.

113
00:10:23.559 --> 00:10:25.279
Well, then.

114
00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:27.039
I'll help you call him.

115
00:10:27.039 --> 00:10:30.120
If I can get a hold of him,
I'll let you know.

116
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.720
Thank you.

117
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.399
I'll get on with what I was doing.
Talk to you later.

118
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.240
Okay. Bye.

119
00:10:48.799 --> 00:10:50.159
Where did he go?

120
00:12:00.159 --> 00:12:01.320
I'm sorry!

121
00:14:44.799 --> 00:14:46.080
You're still so beautiful.

122
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.879
You haven't changed one bit.

123
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.919
It's nothing, really.

124
00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:54.960
How are you doing?

125
00:14:56.519 --> 00:14:57.799
I'm alright.

126
00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.600
What about you?

127
00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.879
I'm doing okay.

128
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.120
Why don't you

129
00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:08.159
get married?

130
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.240
As for me,

131
00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.039
I'm already married.

132
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.080
Oh,

133
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.519
why didn't I know about this?

134
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:19.799
I saw you smiling.

135
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.360
I'm happy that you still can.

136
00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.360
I was smiling

137
00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:28.600
- but I...
- I have a lot to tell you.

138
00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:33.320
This place hasn't changed at all.

139
00:15:34.759 --> 00:15:36.559
It always reminds me of you.

140
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.960
- Excuse me.
- We used to be so happy.

141
00:15:41.159 --> 00:15:42.159
Don't you think so?

142
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.120
Can you even hear me?

143
00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:47.759
Uhh...

144
00:15:49.919 --> 00:15:51.200
Why do you

145
00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.559
have to lie to me about being deaf?

146
00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:55.000
Cut, cut, cut.

147
00:15:55.159 --> 00:15:56.679
Scene 65, cut 1, take 1.

148
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.799
Well... Primrose,

149
00:16:04.039 --> 00:16:05.919
what were you doing?

150
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.679
The character

151
00:16:08.679 --> 00:16:11.519
has to be more powerful.

152
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.799
She has to feel very sad.

153
00:16:14.799 --> 00:16:17.600
Once you find out that he's deaf,

154
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.440
what does that mean? It means

155
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.480
that whatever you say,

156
00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:23.080
he won't hear you.

157
00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.519
You know that you can't communicate
with him properly anymore, right?

158
00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:27.840
More sadness!

159
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.080
Okay, okay.

160
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.320
Can we do it again?

161
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.639
Yes, from the top.

162
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.480
Okay. Please go there again.

163
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.879
Okay. One more time.

164
00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:40.799
Take!

165
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.039
And action!

166
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.039
You're still so beautiful.

167
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.519
You haven't changed one bit.

168
00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.279
It's nothing, really.

169
00:17:00.799 --> 00:17:03.399
How are you doing?

170
00:17:03.879 --> 00:17:05.440
Cut, cut, cut.

171
00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.079
Gosh.

172
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.440
Come here.

173
00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:22.839
Do you know that you're
wasting my time?

174
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:24.960
And not just me,

175
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.599
the entire crew as well.

176
00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.079
Why can't you concentrate?

177
00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:34.359
Should we let her rest a bit?

178
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.759
It seems like she isn't ready yet.

179
00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.319
Excuse me, Tan.

180
00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:46.920
The authority to tell people whether
they can rest or not lies with me.

181
00:17:49.119 --> 00:17:51.039
But if the actor
really can't perform,

182
00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:53.559
are you going to be mean to her?

183
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.799
Tan, it's okay. I can do it.

184
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.200
Let's keep going.

185
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.599
That's my Primrose.

186
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.279
Let's continue.

187
00:18:05.279 --> 00:18:08.319
Okay. Come on. One more time.
Tan, please...

188
00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:09.519
But I can't do it.

189
00:18:11.599 --> 00:18:12.680
Excuse me,

190
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:14.359
I need a break.

191
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.079
Is Mai home?

192
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.960
Uhh...

193
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.890
Mai went out to run some errands.

194
00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:08.559
What's the matter?

195
00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:12.720
I brought some liquid food
and groceries.

196
00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:16.519
I'm going away for a few days.

197
00:19:19.279 --> 00:19:21.759
Whose are these?

198
00:19:23.119 --> 00:19:24.480
They're for Rung, of course.

199
00:19:24.839 --> 00:19:27.039
The lady who's sleeping
on the second floor.

200
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.559
Haven't you met her?

201
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.799
Oh. I have.

202
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.240
I have to go now.

203
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.559
Hold on.

204
00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:39.680
Well,

205
00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.200
what's the matter with Rung?

206
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.920
Rin.

207
00:19:58.799 --> 00:19:59.799
Rin.

208
00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.240
Huh?

209
00:20:01.359 --> 00:20:02.650
Are you okay?

210
00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:05.720
Uhh...

211
00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:08.559
Sao, the nurse,

212
00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:12.079
said that she's going to
be out of town for a few days.

213
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.039
So she

214
00:20:16.119 --> 00:20:17.839
brought these things over.

215
00:20:24.279 --> 00:20:26.079
They're for Rung.

216
00:20:36.359 --> 00:20:37.410
Thank you.

217
00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:40.410
Oh?

218
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.519
Why are you home early?

219
00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:46.279
I asked to leave early.

220
00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:55.680
Someone from the set is calling.

221
00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.200
Did you do something again?

222
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.599
Hello?

223
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.000
Okay. I'll head over to the set.

224
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Okay.

225
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.799
Tan!

226
00:21:09.079 --> 00:21:10.680
You're dead meat once I'm back!

227
00:21:12.279 --> 00:21:14.650
The outfit! I'll be back.

228
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.890
I feel sorry for her

229
00:21:22.759 --> 00:21:24.960
that she has to lie there

230
00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.890
like Sleeping Beauty.

231
00:21:30.839 --> 00:21:33.359
I've been her nurse
for two years now.

232
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.279
The more I know about her,
the more I feel sorry for her.

233
00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.839
Out of nowhere,

234
00:21:38.279 --> 00:21:41.480
all of her hard work
got plagiarized.

235
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.039
So she lost the will to live.

236
00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:47.960
Her work was plagiarized?

237
00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.279
I only know it in passing.

238
00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:55.880
But I don't know the details.

239
00:21:56.279 --> 00:21:58.160
I have to get going now.

240
00:22:27.519 --> 00:22:30.640
All of her hard work
got plagiarized.

241
00:22:31.359 --> 00:22:33.720
So she lost the will to live.

242
00:22:42.359 --> 00:22:43.559
What's wrong?

243
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.640
There's quite a bit to think about.

244
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.079
What about you?

245
00:23:01.519 --> 00:23:03.440
I'm thinking about my career.

246
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.319
Being an actor?

247
00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.640
Yes.

248
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.960
Actually, I don't really

249
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.960
want to be an actor or anything.

250
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.079
But there's something
that requires a lot of money.

251
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.400
So I have to bear with it for now.

252
00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.920
Is it about your sister?

253
00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:57.079
I'm sorry.

254
00:23:57.799 --> 00:23:59.440
Is it something that you want to
keep as a secret?

255
00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:04.559
No.

256
00:24:05.359 --> 00:24:07.960
There is nothing to hide.

257
00:24:08.799 --> 00:24:11.119
But I'm fed up with
answering people's questions.

258
00:24:12.359 --> 00:24:15.200
From both the press
and other people.

259
00:24:17.759 --> 00:24:19.720
You know I'm not keen
on those kinds of things.

260
00:24:26.119 --> 00:24:29.079
My sister used to dream
about becoming a designer.

261
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.359
But before she was
able to achieve it,

262
00:24:36.039 --> 00:24:38.119
she became Sleeping Beauty.

263
00:24:38.839 --> 00:24:40.200
It's been three years already.

264
00:24:41.759 --> 00:24:44.440
Mai and I have been caring for her.

265
00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.559
It's funny, really.

266
00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.799
The person who has the dream

267
00:24:50.079 --> 00:24:51.720
is fast asleep.

268
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.960
But the person who has to wake up
and go to work every day like me,

269
00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.640
has no dream at all.

270
00:25:07.119 --> 00:25:08.680
How is it wrong

271
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.519
not having a dream?

272
00:25:17.039 --> 00:25:18.640
Actually,

273
00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:21.039
you are

274
00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:23.000
quite sensitive.

275
00:25:24.079 --> 00:25:25.079
Me?

276
00:25:26.079 --> 00:25:27.079
Yes.

277
00:25:28.799 --> 00:25:30.359
It's because I've always

278
00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.079
heard your thoughts
through the rain.

279
00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.839
So I know that

280
00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:41.920
you are very mindful
of your surroundings.

281
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.319
And you are very observant

282
00:25:45.079 --> 00:25:48.000
about minor details.

283
00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:51.519
Am I like that?

284
00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:54.319
That's right.

285
00:25:59.799 --> 00:26:01.160
Thanks for understanding.

286
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.960
You're also different
from what I thought.

287
00:26:08.039 --> 00:26:09.799
Really? How?

288
00:26:10.119 --> 00:26:11.599
When I first met you,

289
00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.400
I felt that you were

290
00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:17.559
stuck in your own head.

291
00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:20.039
That's not a compliment, is it?

292
00:26:21.119 --> 00:26:23.559
But I didn't think that
you could also be very lovely.

293
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.240
Lovely?

294
00:26:29.359 --> 00:26:31.119
Are my ears playing tricks on me?

295
00:26:31.559 --> 00:26:32.640
Lovely?

296
00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.480
Well, I'm trying to become
the prince that you like so much.

297
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.480
Is this

298
00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.480
close enough

299
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.279
to the prince you've envisioned?

300
00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.160
I think I'm hungry.

301
00:27:12.839 --> 00:27:14.480
Let's find something to eat.

302
00:27:35.519 --> 00:27:36.599
Rin,

303
00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:38.119
wait up.

304
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.519
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I won't let it happen again.

305
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.359
If it does, I'll remove him
from the movie.

306
00:27:55.759 --> 00:27:57.960
I heard he's famous now. So?

307
00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.240
Does he think he can treat others
however he wants to?

308
00:28:01.359 --> 00:28:02.960
It's not like that.

309
00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:05.160
I'll take responsibility.

310
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.960
Warn him for me.

311
00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:09.920
Okay. I'm sorry.

312
00:28:11.079 --> 00:28:12.240
Mai.

313
00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.799
It's not Tanthai's fault.

314
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.480
I think he did it because of me.

315
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:23.440
Yes?

316
00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.960
Can I ask you a favor?

317
00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.279
It's me.

318
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.559
Give back what's mine!

319
00:30:05.119 --> 00:30:07.240
Oh, you're up.

320
00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.799
You're up early too.

321
00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.640
I had a dream about Rung last night.

322
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.680
So I came to see her
after I woke up.

323
00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.319
Are you alright?

324
00:30:33.519 --> 00:30:34.759
Why do you look so pale?

325
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.079
Oh...

326
00:30:38.799 --> 00:30:39.880
It's nothing.

327
00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:45.359
Women always look pale
when they've just woken up.

328
00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:49.440
Are you hungry?

329
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.160
A little.

330
00:30:53.279 --> 00:30:56.519
I'll help you cook today.

331
00:30:58.480 --> 00:30:59.559
Sure.

332
00:30:59.559 --> 00:31:01.079
Then give it your best shot.

333
00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:02.960
I want to try your cooking.

334
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.400
Wait, Tan.

335
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.640
The thing is,

336
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.799
I'd like to ask you about Rung.

337
00:31:17.119 --> 00:31:18.119
Sure.

338
00:31:20.279 --> 00:31:23.519
Well, Rung...

339
00:31:23.839 --> 00:31:24.839
Hold on a second.

340
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:27.880
Hello?

341
00:31:29.839 --> 00:31:32.200
Okay. I'll be right there.

342
00:31:34.119 --> 00:31:35.119
Who was it?

343
00:31:36.759 --> 00:31:38.640
Oh, no one.

344
00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.160
I'll see you later.

345
00:31:47.279 --> 00:31:48.960
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

346
00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:57.119
I'm sorry for bothering you
all of the sudden like this.

347
00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.759
Well...

348
00:32:00.119 --> 00:32:01.960
I'd like to thank you.

349
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.720
I've dreamed about becoming
an actor for a while now.

350
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.680
But I know that the path to
becoming one isn't easy.

351
00:32:12.319 --> 00:32:14.400
I've given up so much

352
00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.440
to be able to get here.

353
00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.200
In my life, there are no choices.

354
00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:24.039
So I've always had to let
myself be oppressed.

355
00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:27.960
You're misunderstanding something.

356
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.119
Everyone always has a choice.

357
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.640
As for me, sometimes

358
00:32:35.759 --> 00:32:38.519
I have to do things that
I don't want to do as well.

359
00:32:39.839 --> 00:32:41.960
But I have to do it
in exchange for something else.

360
00:32:44.559 --> 00:32:47.079
But the thing I will never let go of

361
00:32:48.319 --> 00:32:49.839
is my own self-worth.

362
00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:54.039
I guess

363
00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:58.039
I don't look so good in your eyes.

364
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.079
Wait.

365
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.759
Can you listen to me for a bit?

366
00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.759
I don't want you
to misunderstand me.

367
00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:18.680
What you said is probably true.

368
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.920
But first, I'm sorry to have
made you feel worse.

369
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.039
You don't have to care
about those people.

370
00:33:28.599 --> 00:33:30.119
Just be yourself.

371
00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:35.200
But if I don't care about others
like you said,

372
00:33:35.559 --> 00:33:37.440
I'd end up like you.

373
00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.960
But what you get for being like me

374
00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.720
is freedom.

375
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.400
Thank you for reminding me.

376
00:33:55.279 --> 00:33:56.319
Is there anything

377
00:33:57.319 --> 00:34:00.279
I can do to thank you?

378
00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.079
Just treat me to some coffee.

379
00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.759
That's all?

380
00:34:06.799 --> 00:34:08.360
Who said that's all?

381
00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:10.920
The coffee is on you

382
00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:12.519
until we finish filming this movie.

383
00:34:17.559 --> 00:34:20.559
Hello, is this
the "Tai Tiang Banterng" page?

384
00:34:22.329 --> 00:34:24.559
I told you I won't cause
any more trouble.

385
00:34:24.769 --> 00:34:26.559
Why didn't you stay home with Rin?

386
00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:28.119
I don't want her to be home alone.

387
00:34:28.119 --> 00:34:29.289
I had no choice.

388
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.960
I'm worried about her too.

389
00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.960
But last time, I had to pay
for all the damages.

390
00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.960
If something happens again, I won't
be able to pay up anymore.

391
00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:39.199
I know. I'm sorry.

392
00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:41.559
But I'm worried about Rarin.

393
00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.920
I know that too.

394
00:34:44.039 --> 00:34:45.599
I've already told her
to lock the door.

395
00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:46.960
Nothing's going to happen.

396
00:34:48.039 --> 00:34:51.639
How about this? I'll call Rarin
when you're shooting a scene.

397
00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:52.639
So you can rest assured.

398
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.559
- But...
- No buts.

399
00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:56.400
They're waiting. Get to work.

400
00:34:57.639 --> 00:34:58.639
Mm-hmm.

401
00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:00.880
Hello.

402
00:35:01.239 --> 00:35:03.119
- What's going on?
- Shall we begin?

403
00:35:03.119 --> 00:35:05.159
- Sure.
- Have you seen this?

404
00:35:12.719 --> 00:35:13.719
What's going on?

405
00:35:14.679 --> 00:35:16.289
Hello, everyone.

406
00:35:19.329 --> 00:35:20.329
Here.

407
00:35:20.809 --> 00:35:22.809
Your coffee, as promised.

408
00:35:24.559 --> 00:35:25.639
Thank you.

409
00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:53.079
Oh.

410
00:36:06.809 --> 00:36:08.400
(Tai Tiang Banterng)

411
00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.809
(Love in real life.
Tanthai-Primrose)

412
00:36:23.079 --> 00:36:26.440
(Love in real life.
Tanthai-Primrose)

413
00:36:28.239 --> 00:36:29.880
Something urgent came up.

414
00:36:30.289 --> 00:36:31.599
I might have to leave soon.

415
00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:34.599
Who was it?

416
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.360
Oh, no one.

417
00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:39.840
I'll see you later.

418
00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:54.400
Is this

419
00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.480
close enough

420
00:36:56.719 --> 00:36:58.289
to the prince you've envisioned?

421
00:37:19.239 --> 00:37:20.360
Hello, Porsche.

422
00:37:20.679 --> 00:37:21.679
I'm sorry, Rin.

423
00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:26.079
- Where have you been?
- I went to find myself in Tibet.

424
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:27.329
Tibet?

425
00:37:27.329 --> 00:37:31.039
I'm sorry for doing this and not
thinking about your feelings at all.

426
00:37:31.329 --> 00:37:33.119
But I've got things
all figured out now.

427
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.239
From now on,
I'm going to be a better person.

428
00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.119
Can you give me a chance?

429
00:37:39.239 --> 00:37:40.440
What are you talking about?

430
00:37:41.809 --> 00:37:44.440
Anyway, you can come back now. I...

431
00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:47.360
Everyone's worried about you.

432
00:37:47.679 --> 00:37:49.769
I just landed.

433
00:37:50.039 --> 00:37:52.769
Where are you, Rin? At the studio?
I’ll drop by there.

434
00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.679
No.

435
00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.400
I'm not.

436
00:37:57.039 --> 00:37:58.679
The thing is,

437
00:37:59.769 --> 00:38:01.400
there's a bit of a problem.

438
00:38:02.519 --> 00:38:05.289
Why do you have to
lie to me about being deaf?

439
00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:11.239
I have something to attend to.
Excuse me.

440
00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.440
Poom.

441
00:38:26.119 --> 00:38:27.239
I'm sorry.

442
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.519
I almost got away with it, didn't I?

443
00:38:35.199 --> 00:38:37.039
I tried to read your lips

444
00:38:37.199 --> 00:38:38.480
but it's still...

445
00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:43.809
You almost had me fooled.

446
00:38:44.679 --> 00:38:47.239
You were good
at pretending to hear me.

447
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.480
I don't know
what you're saying at all.

448
00:38:52.639 --> 00:38:54.480
I only know that you're crying.

449
00:38:57.679 --> 00:38:58.960
Poom!

450
00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.920
I...

451
00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.159
love you.

452
00:39:08.199 --> 00:39:09.769
I love you too.

453
00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.809
- Cut.
- All good.

454
00:39:23.809 --> 00:39:26.119
That's a wrap for today, everyone!

455
00:39:26.119 --> 00:39:27.599
Thank you very much.

456
00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:29.239
Thank you.

457
00:39:29.239 --> 00:39:30.639
Thank you.

458
00:39:32.159 --> 00:39:34.360
Let's get things packed up.

459
00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:37.239
What are you doing?
Pack everything up now.

460
00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:40.599
Thank you.

461
00:39:41.119 --> 00:39:42.159
Awesome.

462
00:39:42.599 --> 00:39:43.679
Thank you.

463
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.599
Thank you to you too.

464
00:39:46.159 --> 00:39:47.239
You did well too.

465
00:39:52.329 --> 00:39:55.159
- Are you going home?
- I am. Goodbye.

466
00:40:13.289 --> 00:40:14.360
Get in.

467
00:40:19.239 --> 00:40:20.559
I want to have a word with you.

468
00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:22.809
I'm not giving you a lift.

469
00:40:26.329 --> 00:40:27.329
Get in.

470
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.289
I saw the news

471
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.880
about you and Tan.

472
00:40:41.769 --> 00:40:43.329
You're good.

473
00:40:45.159 --> 00:40:47.679
There's nothing going on between us.

474
00:40:49.719 --> 00:40:52.599
I don't care if there is or isn't.

475
00:40:54.039 --> 00:40:57.289
I want you to keep making
the headlines like this

476
00:40:57.719 --> 00:41:00.599
because it's good for the movie's
publicity, understand?

477
00:41:01.079 --> 00:41:03.440
And why do I have to?

478
00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.289
Richie told me

479
00:41:10.769 --> 00:41:13.079
that your mom is neck-deep in debt.

480
00:41:19.199 --> 00:41:20.639
Think carefully.

481
00:41:22.119 --> 00:41:24.769
Fame always comes with money.

482
00:41:25.159 --> 00:41:27.639
And it doesn't matter
how you gain it.

483
00:41:29.679 --> 00:41:31.360
I've shown you the way.

484
00:41:31.719 --> 00:41:33.440
It's a win-win situation.

485
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.289
Isn't a rumor about
being with a male celebrity

486
00:41:37.769 --> 00:41:41.679
better than being
a foreign investors's sugar baby?

487
00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.039
Think about it.

488
00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.079
You can get out now.

489
00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.679
It's good that we finished
early tonight.

490
00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.960
I'm really worried about Rarin.

491
00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:21.079
Oh, wow!

492
00:42:25.769 --> 00:42:29.880
If you were half as worried
about work as you are with Rarin,

493
00:42:30.769 --> 00:42:33.079
I'd be ever so grateful.

494
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:39.719
Whose car is that?

495
00:42:42.719 --> 00:42:43.719
Tan!

496
00:42:44.519 --> 00:42:45.519
Tan!

497
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.199
What are you doing here?

498
00:42:53.079 --> 00:42:55.199
- Let's go, Porsche.
- Come on.

499
00:42:55.809 --> 00:42:56.809
Rin.

500
00:42:59.199 --> 00:43:01.119
I have to go back to my place.

501
00:43:01.679 --> 00:43:03.559
But you're safer here.

502
00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.400
Tan,

503
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.440
I'm okay.

504
00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.239
I'll take care of you.

505
00:43:12.639 --> 00:43:13.679
Don't worry.

506
00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.239
I can take care of you too.

507
00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.639
But you have to work.

508
00:43:19.079 --> 00:43:20.769
I have to work too.

509
00:43:21.239 --> 00:43:24.119
When I stay here,

510
00:43:24.639 --> 00:43:26.239
I'm not inspired to work.

511
00:43:28.159 --> 00:43:30.199
I want to go back and work
in my own space.

512
00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.360
Porsche,

513
00:43:40.239 --> 00:43:42.239
can I talk to you in private?

514
00:43:46.559 --> 00:43:47.719
Gladly.

515
00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.960
Rin, wait for me in the car.
I won't be long.

516
00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.199
Wait inside, Mai.

517
00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.679
What do you really want?

518
00:44:04.239 --> 00:44:05.679
I know that before,

519
00:44:06.079 --> 00:44:07.559
I wasn't fair with you.

520
00:44:08.719 --> 00:44:10.239
But you were sneaky too.

521
00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.519
You used the excuse that
Rin was harmed to detain her.

522
00:44:15.199 --> 00:44:16.280
Detain?

523
00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.719
I just wanted to take responsibility
and protect her.

524
00:44:18.719 --> 00:44:19.800
Are you sure

525
00:44:21.159 --> 00:44:22.159
that you didn't

526
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.320
fall in love with Rin?

527
00:44:26.039 --> 00:44:27.960
You only used this excuse

528
00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.519
to bind her to you. That's all.

529
00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.519
I'm telling you. I've decided

530
00:44:35.559 --> 00:44:38.280
to propose to Rin,

531
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:42.840
seriously.

532
00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
See?

533
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.760
This is what they called readiness.

534
00:44:50.719 --> 00:44:52.599
I'm ready to take care of her.

535
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.960
I believe that my feelings
towards her are no less than yours.

536
00:44:58.559 --> 00:44:59.840
Have you asked yourself

537
00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.840
if you're ready to take care of her?

538
00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.440
Are you sure that she'll be happy
when she's with you?

539
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.360
If you can't answer those questions,

540
00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.800
it means you don't deserve her.

541
00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.079
That's all. Don't stress out.

542
00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.400
If you can't answer those questions,

543
00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.639
it means you don't deserve her.

544
00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.079
The person who dropped you off

545
00:45:38.559 --> 00:45:40.480
must have helped you a lot,
isn't that right?

546
00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:43.519
When are you going
to accept the feelings

547
00:45:43.719 --> 00:45:45.599
I have towards you that are
more than just friendship?

548
00:45:46.519 --> 00:45:48.079
Marry me, Rin.
