1
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.439
Are you going to make me a suit?

2
00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:43.799
No.

3
00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.560
I'm not making you a suit.

4
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.959
I wasn't talking to you.

5
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.719
Can you be quiet for a second?

6
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.200
Oh?

7
00:01:58.519 --> 00:02:01.680
Then, who were you talking to?

8
00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:04.959
Chest 40.

9
00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.280
Upper arm 15.

10
00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.639
Arm length 16.5.

11
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.479
Overlap 28.5.

12
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.159
Wrist 7.

13
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.120
Shoulders 18.5.

14
00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.960
Front shoulder 16.5.

15
00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:31.090
Front torso 17.

16
00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.840
Back shoulder 16.5.

17
00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.840
Back torso 19.

18
00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.879
Neck 15.5.

19
00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:48.800
Waist 32.

20
00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.360
Hips 36.

21
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.680
I need to thank you

22
00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.280
and to talk to you
about many things.

23
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.039
I have something
to tell you as well.

24
00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.719
I hate you so much.

25
00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:17.800
Rin?

26
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.879
- Rin?
- Yes?

27
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.159
Are you alright?

28
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.080
That's right. You just froze.

29
00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.520
Well, I...

30
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.319
Oh, the rain stopped.

31
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.960
It comes and goes like that.

32
00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.400
Right.

33
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.240
Just a second.

34
00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.400
Hello?

35
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.199
Really?

36
00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.599
Okay.

37
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.879
I have to excuse myself.

38
00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.719
Tanthai isn't feeling good.

39
00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:01.919
And we have to go to a fitting...

40
00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:04.479
for another brand.

41
00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:11.319
I'll excuse myself now.

42
00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:13.719
I'll see her off.

43
00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:24.170
Tan.

44
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.000
Tan.

45
00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:37.170
Tan.

46
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.839
Tan, wait.

47
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.240
Aren't you going to talk
about the...

48
00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:51.319
About what happened?

49
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.959
Can we do it later
if it's about that?

50
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.240
But I have nothing to talk about.

51
00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.879
I don't want to believe
what happened either.

52
00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:03.050
But now that we've met,

53
00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.199
I'd like to know

54
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.839
what's happened between us as well.

55
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.199
Do you know

56
00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:21.959
how long I've been annoyed with...

57
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.439
with this nonsense?

58
00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:27.839
I don't care what it is,

59
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.879
whether it's a special power
or a curse.

60
00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.920
I think we should
stay away from each other.

61
00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:43.079
Mai, let's go.

62
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.439
Wait.

63
00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:52.160
Shoot!

64
00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:58.800
Rarin!

65
00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:01.959
Will you marry me?

66
00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:06.480
No.

67
00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:11.879
(60th wedding proposal)

68
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.680
Rin, why not?

69
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.399
It's probably the 60th time that
I've turned you down, Pos.

70
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.079
Why are you so sulky, hon?
You won't answer my calls

71
00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.160
or my texts. Are you
angry with me, hon?

72
00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:27.360
I'm not.

73
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.600
But can you stop calling me "hon?"

74
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.759
- How come?
- We're not a couple.

75
00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:32.959
- No need to be embarrassed.
- Hey, hey!

76
00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:35.079
Hey, hey! Wassup man? Hey, yo!

77
00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:36.480
Pay some attention.

78
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.439
You opened the door and hit my car.

79
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.639
Oh, calm down.

80
00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:42.720
Right.

81
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.279
This is my card.

82
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.959
Call me later. I have to talk
to my future wife.

83
00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:51.319
- What are you...
- Hey, hey!

84
00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:54.160
Tan, enough!

85
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.959
That's enough!

86
00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:57.759
- Stop!
- Cut it out!

87
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.680
I'll call you back.

88
00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:06.040
Get in the car.

89
00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:07.920
- But our car...
- Get in the car.

90
00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:09.680
Aren't you in a hurry to leave?

91
00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:13.560
Hurry up. Get in the car.

92
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.480
- Pos!
- Get in the car.

93
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.680
In-the-car.

94
00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:39.959
Who was that jerk?

95
00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:46.360
Rin?

96
00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:48.360
Rin!

97
00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:56.399
Perfect!

98
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.920
Don't worry, Mai.

99
00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:05.800
With my decades of experience
in the industry, I can guarantee it.

100
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.959
Okay. I hope Tan likes it.

101
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.720
Perfect.

102
00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:20.959
Satan. The devil.

103
00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:24.560
I'm sorry. I think
this outfit is still...

104
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.639
I think

105
00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:28.040
the outfit is a go.

106
00:08:28.959 --> 00:08:30.040
A go? So that means...

107
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.360
It means it's okay.

108
00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.240
It's more than okay.

109
00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:37.120
I assure you,
once you arrive at the event,

110
00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.879
all eyes will be on you
and you only.

111
00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:44.159
All the reporters will
swarm you for sure.

112
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.799
Wichai, do you have
any other choices?

113
00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:53.879
Don't worry, Mai.

114
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.480
This outfit is definitely
for a manly man like Tan.

115
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.210
I don't want to wear this.

116
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.519
Please change it for me.

117
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.480
One moment, please.

118
00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:13.840
The thing is, other brands are
giving us the cold-shoulder.

119
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.480
I know you don't like the outfit.
But can't you just bear with it?

120
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:20.759
I'm trying to be civilized.

121
00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:23.840
But don't I even get to
have a say in what I wear?

122
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.120
For now, you don't. I don't either.

123
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.600
But this is beyond acceptable!

124
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.399
- What should I do, then?
- I don't know!

125
00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:50.120
I'm so exhausted today.

126
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:52.159
Hey, you.

127
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.600
Oh, wait. Tanthai.

128
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.120
You again?

129
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.090
It's been a while
since we last talked.

130
00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.480
Can you just get out of my head?
I'm begging you.

131
00:10:08.279 --> 00:10:09.840
I'd like to do that.

132
00:10:10.159 --> 00:10:12.330
But how can I stop my own thoughts?

133
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.360
You're so annoying.

134
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:21.720
Seriously,

135
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.120
why do you hate me so much?

136
00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:29.210
Ahh!

137
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.090
Wait. What are you doing?

138
00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.450
Jerk! Stop making
those weird noises.

139
00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:38.960
Ahh!

140
00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:47.120
Tan, now that we're talking, why
don't we talk nicely to each other?

141
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.639
I have a lot of things to ask you.

142
00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:52.330
I have questions for you too.

143
00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.639
Hmm? What is it?

144
00:10:53.639 --> 00:10:57.120
Are all women scatterbrains
like you?

145
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.799
Can you stop being cheeky
with me already?

146
00:10:59.799 --> 00:11:02.440
I'm not a scatterbrain.

147
00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:05.960
Hey! It's that bag.

148
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.960
I've only seen it in pictures.
It's so pretty!

149
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.399
See?

150
00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:11.879
Stop teasing me.

151
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.000
That woman's got a nice bag
but her perfume stinks.

152
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.080
See?

153
00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:20.039
Well, I can't stop thinking.
What do you want me to do?

154
00:11:20.919 --> 00:11:23.399
Just think when it's necessary.

155
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.080
- The lift! Wait for me!
- Hmm?

156
00:11:44.759 --> 00:11:46.759
Have you been living here long?

157
00:11:47.399 --> 00:11:49.759
Why haven't I seen you before?

158
00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:52.559
I just moved here.

159
00:11:52.559 --> 00:11:55.840
I need a private space
because of my acting job.

160
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.240
That explains it.

161
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.200
I've been living here for ages,
but I've never seen you.

162
00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.200
And why did I have to
answer you honestly? Darn it.

163
00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:17.799
See? You can't stop
your own thoughts either.

164
00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:21.360
Two.

165
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.159
What are you doing?

166
00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.120
I'm reading the numbers
so I won't have to talk to you.

167
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.840
You need to think of something else.

168
00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:30.039
What should I think of then?

169
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.919
Three.

170
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.000
That smells nice.

171
00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:39.080
What's that smell?

172
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.600
It must be coming from
that lady's bag.

173
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.879
Her family's dinner
for tonight must be

174
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.919
sago with pork filling.

175
00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:51.279
- Four.
- Gosh, I'd like some.

176
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.279
Why haven't I bought any before?

177
00:12:53.559 --> 00:12:58.360
If there's sago, then it should come
with steamed rice dumplings.

178
00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:01.600
Wow! It must be so yummy

179
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.960
when it's hot.

180
00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:05.639
Wow!

181
00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:08.200
Now I really want some.

182
00:13:08.519 --> 00:13:12.360
If you don't think about nonsensical
stuff, then it's only about food?

183
00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.519
Oh? Well, you told me
to think about anything.

184
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.440
I did.

185
00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:21.679
But the things you're thinking about
are all...

186
00:13:21.679 --> 00:13:22.679
annoying!

187
00:13:22.679 --> 00:13:24.720
Hey! Don't belittle me!

188
00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:27.600
Excuse me.

189
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.200
I'd been working all day,

190
00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:34.159
that's why I haven't had dinner yet.

191
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.159
And the lady's sago smells so good.

192
00:13:42.519 --> 00:13:44.879
- What a glutton.
- Well, I'm hungry!

193
00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:50.759
If you're hungry,
would you like some of this?

194
00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:55.279
Oh, it's okay.

195
00:13:55.279 --> 00:13:57.559
Thank you and sorry.

196
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:01.120
Oh, jeez.

197
00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:04.039
So embarrassing.

198
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:07.360
I just found out
how mad designers can get

199
00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:09.679
when they're hangry.

200
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.039
Designers are humans too.

201
00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:14.799
I don't eat fabric for food.

202
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.320
Tan, why can't we talk
nicely like before?

203
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.399
Nine-zero-one.

204
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.919
Hmm? Is that your room number?

205
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.200
Rin, stop rummaging
through the secrets in my head.

206
00:14:40.519 --> 00:14:43.320
I didn't want to.

207
00:14:43.919 --> 00:14:46.240
You're assuming things.

208
00:14:46.559 --> 00:14:49.320
Did you know that
when I put on earphones,

209
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.080
your voice disappears?

210
00:14:51.399 --> 00:14:52.600
Later.

211
00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.960
Where are you going?

212
00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:56.559
Wait, hey!

213
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.360
- Bye.
- Tan!

214
00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.039
Tan!

215
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.320
Tanthai!

216
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.159
Hey.

217
00:15:52.759 --> 00:15:54.200
The rain finally stopped.

218
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.200
Wait, wait, wait.

219
00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.639
What are you doing?

220
00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:10.600
If you don't stop,
then I'm going to call security.

221
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.960
I just wanted to ask you
to come somewhere with me.

222
00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:18.279
And why do I have to?

223
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.120
What if you trick me into
doing something scandalous?

224
00:16:22.639 --> 00:16:24.240
I won't do anything to you.

225
00:16:24.559 --> 00:16:27.639
I guarantee that
I won't put you in harm's way.

226
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.879
Hey, girls!

227
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.799
Why do I only
hear your voice, Prince?

228
00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:18.200
Can you be quiet?
I'm trying to concentrate.

229
00:17:23.279 --> 00:17:25.119
And what are you doing?

230
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.440
I'm reading.

231
00:17:28.599 --> 00:17:30.799
And how many times do I have to
tell you to not call me Prince?

232
00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:32.559
It's ticklish.

233
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.000
Okay then.

234
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.650
What are you reading?

235
00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:50.170
I think for the rest of my life,
there's only going to be you.

236
00:17:51.759 --> 00:17:54.410
Will you be my friend forever?

237
00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.240
I'll read the story out loud.

238
00:18:09.599 --> 00:18:11.359
And you can sit quietly and listen.

239
00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.759
Okay.

240
00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:18.319
But it so happened that,
after walking for a long time

241
00:18:18.319 --> 00:18:22.759
through sand, rocks, and snow,

242
00:18:23.119 --> 00:18:24.960
the little prince finally
came upon a road.

243
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.119
I see.

244
00:18:29.759 --> 00:18:33.759
And all roads lead to people.

245
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:36.170
"Good day," he said.

246
00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:39.920
He was standing in front of a garden
blooming with roses.

247
00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:42.890
"Good day," said the roses.

248
00:18:43.799 --> 00:18:45.960
The little prince stared at them.

249
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.650
They all looked
just like his flowers.

250
00:18:50.359 --> 00:18:54.359
"Who are you?" he demanded,
in astonishment.

251
00:18:54.799 --> 00:18:56.000
What would you like to order?

252
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.039
I'd like a
strawberry yogurt frappe, please.

253
00:19:03.319 --> 00:19:04.960
Right away, miss.

254
00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:27.170
Come in.

255
00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:43.720
Why did you bring me here?

256
00:19:51.359 --> 00:19:55.079
This is the first suit I ever made.

257
00:19:55.759 --> 00:19:58.440
I was inspired by your voice.

258
00:20:00.279 --> 00:20:01.480
Can you

259
00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.279
try it on?

260
00:20:08.759 --> 00:20:10.319
And why should I?

261
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.680
Do you know that

262
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.599
as a designer,

263
00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:20.319
to switch from female
to male clothing

264
00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:22.480
is very challenging?

265
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:27.119
Because anatomically, males
and females are very different.

266
00:20:28.359 --> 00:20:30.720
Especially making a suit.

267
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.279
The measurement needs to be exact.

268
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.039
So?

269
00:20:42.119 --> 00:20:43.920
I made this suit

270
00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.410
in hopes that someone will wear it.

271
00:20:47.799 --> 00:20:50.599
Someone who comforts me
when I'm down.

272
00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:53.799
Someone who talks to me

273
00:20:54.359 --> 00:20:56.119
when I have no one left.

274
00:21:08.079 --> 00:21:10.599
And that certain someone

275
00:21:13.839 --> 00:21:15.960
is standing in front of me now.

276
00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:25.650
But...

277
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:28.119
It's like

278
00:21:28.890 --> 00:21:32.279
a dream knowing
that you actually exist.

279
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.359
And this is probably
the best way for me

280
00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:39.799
to thank you.

281
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.119
I knew that it would fit.

282
00:22:23.759 --> 00:22:25.240
It's probably a coincidence.

283
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.119
I don't think so.

284
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.640
Because I heard your measurements
through our special power.

285
00:22:33.079 --> 00:22:35.519
So I used it

286
00:22:35.519 --> 00:22:38.559
as a reference to make this suit.

287
00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:40.680
28.5.

288
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.680
Wrist 7.

289
00:22:46.839 --> 00:22:48.559
Shoulders 18.5.

290
00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:52.519
Front shoulder 16.5.

291
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.519
Front torso 17.

292
00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.200
Back shoulder 16.5.

293
00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.240
What all did you hear?

294
00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:07.680
Let's get straight
to the point then.

295
00:23:10.319 --> 00:23:11.480
I want you to be

296
00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.279
the muse for Rarin Couture.

297
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:18.759
The muse?

298
00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:22.319
What does that mean?

299
00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.440
A muse is

300
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.440
a person who is
an inspiration to an artist.

301
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.400
Me? Your inspiration?

302
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.599
What if I refuse?

303
00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.119
You won't.

304
00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.960
How can you be so sure?

305
00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.680
Let me rephrase it.

306
00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.079
Mai, your manager, won't refuse.

307
00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.359
Because she knows
that it's a win-win situation.

308
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.359
And I know

309
00:24:07.759 --> 00:24:12.119
what you did at LMAO.

310
00:24:14.359 --> 00:24:15.799
You know about that?

311
00:24:17.519 --> 00:24:19.279
The fashion industry is small.

312
00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.359
I think it will be beneficial
for us both.

313
00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:35.680
You've got a brand like Rarin
to take care of your image.

314
00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:40.319
And I've got a young, rising-star

315
00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:41.799
as my first model.

316
00:24:42.799 --> 00:24:45.359
It sounds like
a win-win situation to me.

317
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.880
So it all comes down to business?

318
00:25:16.359 --> 00:25:17.440
Tanthai!

319
00:25:18.039 --> 00:25:20.480
Hey! Tanthai!

320
00:25:21.079 --> 00:25:22.160
Listen to me!

321
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.079
I will transform you
into a new person.

322
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.319
No, that's not it.

323
00:25:34.599 --> 00:25:36.160
You're still you.

324
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.599
But better.

325
00:25:38.599 --> 00:25:40.480
The best version of you.

326
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.640
Everyone will see you
in a new light.

327
00:25:45.119 --> 00:25:46.559
I'm going to make you

328
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.440
into the prince of Rarin.

329
00:25:51.839 --> 00:25:52.960
I'm begging you.

330
00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:55.640
Please stop calling me Prince.

331
00:25:56.599 --> 00:25:58.440
- I'm not a prince...
- Tanthai.

332
00:26:00.319 --> 00:26:02.839
Other people don't see what I see.

333
00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.759
And other people

334
00:26:07.519 --> 00:26:09.880
don't hear what I hear.

335
00:26:15.039 --> 00:26:17.079
I'm asking you

336
00:26:17.839 --> 00:26:19.480
only to do it for this event.

337
00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:22.640
Please?

338
00:26:30.119 --> 00:26:31.200
Alright.

339
00:26:34.039 --> 00:26:35.680
But if tomorrow night,

340
00:26:36.119 --> 00:26:38.519
I can't be the prince
that you want me to be,

341
00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.680
you have to stop pestering me.

342
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.559
This is the deal.

343
00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.559
Okay?

344
00:27:16.759 --> 00:27:17.839
Are you going now?

345
00:27:18.359 --> 00:27:19.440
Yes.

346
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.920
Don't you want a tour?
Where are you going?

347
00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.240
- That's very sweet!
- Please strike a pose.

348
00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.480
- Smile!
- Very pretty.

349
00:27:38.759 --> 00:27:39.920
This camera, please.

350
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.319
Can you put your arm around her?

351
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.480
That's very cute.

352
00:27:45.119 --> 00:27:46.400
Thank you very much.

353
00:27:46.759 --> 00:27:48.359
Please smile.

354
00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.599
Stand closer to each other.

355
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.200
We would've been in trouble
if Rin didn't help us.

356
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.000
By the way, you actually
look good in that.

357
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.759
Don't I look good
in everything I wear?

358
00:28:05.319 --> 00:28:08.240
Okay. I hope you look good
for the rest of the event.

359
00:28:09.799 --> 00:28:10.920
I'll see you over there.

360
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.720
This way, please.

361
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.759
- This way, Tan.
- This camera, please.

362
00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:23.519
Please strike a pose.

363
00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.359
Smile, please.

364
00:28:25.359 --> 00:28:27.880
- Can I have an interview?
- Can I have an interview?

365
00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.880
It seems you've been hanging out
with Rarin a lot.

366
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.880
- Is there anything going on?
- There's nothing.

367
00:28:36.839 --> 00:28:39.599
You know that I'm outspoken.

368
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.079
If there was something else,

369
00:28:42.079 --> 00:28:43.960
I think you must be assuming things
instead.

370
00:28:44.279 --> 00:28:47.799
Is there any indication from Rarin?

371
00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:55.119
What about you
and the camera person?

372
00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:57.000
Is there anything going on
between you two?

373
00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.000
Anything?

374
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.359
Record it. Record.

375
00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.680
Just like they say.

376
00:29:10.119 --> 00:29:12.279
He's handsome
but he's so ill-mannered.

377
00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.279
What kind of answer
to the press was that?

378
00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.119
What do you think you're doing?

379
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.039
I didn't do anything.

380
00:29:23.039 --> 00:29:24.720
You didn't do anything?

381
00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.240
What kind of crazy celebrity
talks to the press like that?

382
00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:32.000
That's not how a prince
would behave at all.

383
00:29:33.079 --> 00:29:34.359
You're so fussy.

384
00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:38.440
Oh.

385
00:29:48.559 --> 00:29:49.640
Rin,

386
00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:53.119
this is an awards ceremony,
not a party.

387
00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.759
Hold this for me.

388
00:30:23.599 --> 00:30:25.079
This way!

389
00:30:25.799 --> 00:30:27.160
Can I get an interview with you?

390
00:30:29.039 --> 00:30:30.519
She's so pretty!

391
00:30:34.359 --> 00:30:37.759
What brand are you wearing?
Do you like it, Primrose?

392
00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:39.839
I love it.

393
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.559
It's very beautiful.

394
00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:43.640
Thank you very much, Primrose.

395
00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:52.480
Where are you going, Rin?

396
00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.759
You're so pretty.

397
00:30:55.759 --> 00:30:56.839
Prim!

398
00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.200
- Yes?
- What are you doing?

399
00:31:02.599 --> 00:31:03.799
What am I doing?

400
00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.079
This dress.

401
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.119
What's the matter with it?

402
00:31:10.079 --> 00:31:12.279
You modified my design.

403
00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.920
Don't you have
any respect for the designer?

404
00:31:14.039 --> 00:31:15.279
What were you thinking?

405
00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.960
I just shortened your dress a bit.

406
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.039
You know the press likes that.

407
00:31:26.519 --> 00:31:30.160
I'm helping promote your brand.

408
00:31:36.039 --> 00:31:37.119
Prim,

409
00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.519
take it off.

410
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.920
What did you say?

411
00:31:42.799 --> 00:31:44.440
Take off the dress.

412
00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.000
You can no longer wear this dress.

413
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.240
What happened, Rarin?

414
00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.000
Since when did you doing that?

415
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.880
I have to excuse myself.

416
00:31:54.319 --> 00:31:57.720
Rarin, please answer the question!

417
00:32:06.839 --> 00:32:09.400
Please answer the question!

418
00:32:12.279 --> 00:32:14.440
What's wrong with the dress?

419
00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.359
So what's going on?

420
00:32:28.559 --> 00:32:29.640
Hey!

421
00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.319
Tan!

422
00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:36.200
What are you doing?

423
00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.480
I'm a little tipsy.

424
00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.519
I'd like to go home.

425
00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.759
Tan! Tan!

426
00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:55.799
What's going on?

427
00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:22.160
Wow, you're actually quite fierce.

428
00:33:28.799 --> 00:33:29.880
Hurry up!

429
00:33:30.519 --> 00:33:31.720
Quickly!

430
00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.559
Hello, Mai.

431
00:33:57.799 --> 00:33:59.680
That's all for tonight. You can go.

432
00:34:01.319 --> 00:34:02.640
Yes. I'm sorry.

433
00:34:04.839 --> 00:34:06.160
Okay. Bye.

434
00:34:11.519 --> 00:34:12.840
Why did you help me?

435
00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.960
I didn't.

436
00:34:16.599 --> 00:34:18.809
I just left the event

437
00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.679
with you tagging along. That's all.

438
00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:25.480
I'm not drunk.

439
00:34:26.559 --> 00:34:28.360
I'm fully aware of what's going on.

440
00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:33.769
Even though you're not drunk,
you've lost your train of thought.

441
00:35:25.199 --> 00:35:26.440
Do you know that

442
00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.679
it wasn't easy for me
to become a designer?

443
00:35:54.639 --> 00:35:56.360
Since I started working,

444
00:35:56.679 --> 00:35:58.599
I've always been under
so much pressure.

445
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.639
Because I'm a new designer,

446
00:36:03.719 --> 00:36:06.119
I constantly have to prove myself
to other people.

447
00:36:08.289 --> 00:36:10.159
And now after what's happened
tonight...

448
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.920
All my designs are like my babies.

449
00:36:23.289 --> 00:36:27.119
I look after and take care of them.

450
00:36:29.199 --> 00:36:32.000
But then someone treated
one of my babies badly.

451
00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.000
It's...

452
00:36:45.719 --> 00:36:46.809
You know what?

453
00:36:49.159 --> 00:36:50.840
This suit is too hot.

454
00:36:55.809 --> 00:36:57.119
But it's very beautiful.

455
00:37:01.329 --> 00:37:02.400
Thank you.

456
00:37:04.639 --> 00:37:06.079
I just feel sorry for you.

457
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:09.719
Your new brand

458
00:37:10.329 --> 00:37:11.809
is like a bird
that just left its nest.

459
00:37:12.809 --> 00:37:17.000
Those reporters are like a pack of
wolves looking to attack you.

460
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.769
I've always been involved
in scandals.

461
00:37:21.329 --> 00:37:22.679
I have nothing to lose.

462
00:37:26.519 --> 00:37:28.289
But you're actually quite cool.

463
00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.159
You dared to do that
in front of the press.

464
00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.039
What about you?
Don't you want to change yourself?

465
00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.329
I know that you're much better than
what other people see.

466
00:38:06.719 --> 00:38:09.559
You saved me tonight.

467
00:38:14.239 --> 00:38:16.159
Let other people see me
however they want to.

468
00:38:16.679 --> 00:38:18.480
I know what I'm doing,
that's enough.

469
00:38:22.519 --> 00:38:25.679
But you're not alone in this world.

470
00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:29.159
Why do you have to make
other people hate you?

471
00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.079
Even though I haven't been

472
00:38:36.239 --> 00:38:38.639
in this industry for long,

473
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.039
I think it's toxic.

474
00:38:43.239 --> 00:38:45.599
You've been in it longer than me.
You probably know it well.

475
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:52.400
That's true. This industry is toxic.

476
00:38:53.559 --> 00:38:56.289
Some people compete with others
to be in the limelight.

477
00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:01.440
Some people step over others
to get what they want.

478
00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:06.360
But you don't have to
be toxic like them.

479
00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:19.329
I believe that you can

480
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.880
become a prince...

481
00:39:25.119 --> 00:39:27.639
and not a scarecrow.

482
00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:32.809
But a prince

483
00:39:33.769 --> 00:39:36.880
that a regular guy can be.

484
00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.679
No matter what your beliefs are,

485
00:39:45.639 --> 00:39:47.519
I can't be your prince.

486
00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:50.960
Besides,

487
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.400
after tomorrow,
we won't see each other anymore.

488
00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:57.920
What do you mean?

489
00:39:59.079 --> 00:40:01.119
Did you forget about our deal?

490
00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.000
Hold on.

491
00:40:06.199 --> 00:40:08.639
I haven't given up on you yet.

492
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.559
There's no need to guess.

493
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.119
Tomorrow, there'll be news
along the lines of,

494
00:40:14.559 --> 00:40:18.679
"model dragged
the designer out of the event."

495
00:40:20.719 --> 00:40:21.809
"Completely drunk."

496
00:40:24.239 --> 00:40:25.920
But that's not true.

497
00:40:26.239 --> 00:40:28.199
I can explain it to the press.

498
00:40:30.329 --> 00:40:32.920
It's no use.
No one is going to listen to you.

499
00:40:37.519 --> 00:40:38.920
But I'll help you.

500
00:40:41.159 --> 00:40:42.840
I will help improve your image

501
00:40:43.199 --> 00:40:45.199
and make you more nice suits
that you can wear.

502
00:40:45.769 --> 00:40:48.960
I'll take care of your public image.

503
00:40:49.809 --> 00:40:51.159
But please,

504
00:40:51.639 --> 00:40:53.599
will you let me change you?

505
00:40:58.039 --> 00:41:00.400
- I don't need that.
- But I want to.

506
00:41:01.079 --> 00:41:04.639
Why are you so fixated on me?

507
00:41:05.559 --> 00:41:07.039
Why would you put that much
of an effort into me?

508
00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.400
What do you want from me?

509
00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.239
Well, I...

510
00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:14.440
I even told you

511
00:41:15.079 --> 00:41:16.159
that I hate you.

512
00:41:33.769 --> 00:41:34.840
Let's go.

513
00:41:36.039 --> 00:41:37.119
I'll give you a lift.

514
00:42:15.559 --> 00:42:17.400
- Tan!
- Tan!

515
00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.480
What's going on with Rarin?

516
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.769
- I'd rather not answer right now.
- It's a private time. Excuse me.

517
00:42:22.769 --> 00:42:25.960
There's a rumor about Rarin visiting
you at your condo. Is that true?

518
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.920
- It's true. But...
- This is not a good time.

519
00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.400
What about your sister?

520
00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.719
She's also a designer like Rarin.

521
00:42:45.039 --> 00:42:46.769
How are they connected?

522
00:42:46.769 --> 00:42:50.400
Is it true that Rarin helped pay
for her medical expenses?

523
00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.039
Is that why there's something
going on between you two?

524
00:42:52.159 --> 00:42:53.519
Please answer the question.

525
00:42:53.519 --> 00:42:55.079
Please answer the question, Tan.

526
00:42:55.079 --> 00:42:56.920
Why do you have to hide
the truth from us?

527
00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.769
So what's going on
between you and Rarin?

528
00:42:58.769 --> 00:42:59.960
Please answer the question.

529
00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:03.199
Why are these people so selfish?

530
00:43:03.199 --> 00:43:05.809
(Wasted Celebrity T Dragged
Designer R Away from the Red Carpet)

531
00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:07.440
Tan?

532
00:43:09.289 --> 00:43:11.289
I want to get out of here.

533
00:43:12.519 --> 00:43:15.440
Hey, can you hear me?

534
00:43:15.679 --> 00:43:17.480
This again?

535
00:43:18.559 --> 00:43:21.880
Why? Why does it have
to be about Rung?

536
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.440
Tan, can you hear me?

537
00:43:27.159 --> 00:43:28.329
Where are you?

538
00:43:30.289 --> 00:43:31.599
I can't take it anymore.

539
00:43:32.159 --> 00:43:33.880
I want to get out of here.

540
00:43:34.119 --> 00:43:37.289
- Why are these people so selfish?
- Tan?

541
00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:42.599
- Can you hear me?
- This again?

542
00:43:42.599 --> 00:43:44.440
- Tanthai?
- Why are these people so selfish?

543
00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.119
I want to get out of here.

544
00:43:46.119 --> 00:43:48.039
Why does it have to be about Rung?
Can't it be about something else?

545
00:43:48.039 --> 00:43:49.960
What are they thinking?
Why does it have to be about Rung?

546
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.199
- I can't take it anymore.
- Tanthai!

547
00:43:53.480 --> 00:43:54.559
Tanthai?

548
00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:36.880
I'm here now.

549
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.199
I'll help you.

550
00:45:01.199 --> 00:45:03.400
We're in talks about me
becoming the muse.

551
00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:05.360
I have my own reasons.

552
00:45:05.639 --> 00:45:08.119
From now on, let's stay out
of each other's business.

553
00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.400
Rin, what's wrong?

554
00:45:12.679 --> 00:45:13.880
Are you sick?

555
00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:16.360
Tanthai, help me.

556
00:45:16.599 --> 00:45:18.039
Hang in there, Rin.

557
00:45:18.519 --> 00:45:19.920
I'm coming to see you.

558
00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:25.559
I don't want you going
near her anymore.

559
00:45:25.719 --> 00:45:27.440
Her life is chaotic enough as it is.

560
00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.800
I won't wear Rarin's
clothing anymore.
