1
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.239
Let's find something to do then.

2
00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:44.879
Where are you going?

3
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.280
Well,

4
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.280
go my own way.

5
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.519
I've been thinking about it
for a while now.

6
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.239
I want to get out there
and discover who I am.

7
00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.560
You've always been
working by yourself.

8
00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:04.239
I'm talking about my true self.

9
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.439
The one that doesn't need
to wait for the rain.

10
00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.639
The one that doesn't need
to rely on others.

11
00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.039
The one

12
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.120
that actually listens to my heart.

13
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.439
What about me?

14
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.280
Am I there, among your heartbeat?

15
00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:30.879
Of course, you are.

16
00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:32.759
But

17
00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:36.840
you know how much I love my job.

18
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.840
It's funny, actually.

19
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.960
If we look back,

20
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.120
after all this time,

21
00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:47.840
it's always been about work
between us

22
00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:52.240
to the point that I don't even know
if the reason I love you

23
00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:56.599
is because

24
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.280
of work or not.

25
00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:03.520
So what?

26
00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.680
Does it even matter why you love me?

27
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.560
Whether it's because of work,

28
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.639
me being myself,

29
00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.639
me being your prince,

30
00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.520
or any other stupid reason.

31
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.240
But today, I've come to a decision.

32
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.879
No matter what's going to happen,

33
00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.919
I will always love you.

34
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.960
But you're just going to
break up with me.

35
00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:43.879
It's because I love you. That's why
I have to be honest to you.

36
00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.919
I didn't want everything
to end up like this either.

37
00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.080
But if I don't find out
the answer for myself,

38
00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.560
how can our relationship
move forward?

39
00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.199
I don't understand you at all, Rin.

40
00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.879
I really don't.

41
00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:25.279
I love you, Rin.

42
00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:29.199
I love you. Do you hear me?

43
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.439
Isn't there any way
I can change your mind?

44
00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:06.319
Tan,

45
00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.680
I've thought carefully about this.

46
00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:17.639
I don't want to listen
to you anymore.

47
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.360
Tan,

48
00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:26.879
I don't know how long
it's going to take either.

49
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.360
It might be one year,

50
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.800
a decade,

51
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.879
or the rest of my life.

52
00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:37.399
I don't know.

53
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.199
Tan, don't wait for me.

54
00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:52.519
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.720
But I don't know
how to say it in a way that

56
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.480
will make you feel less sad.

57
00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:04.120
Thank you

58
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.759
for coming into my life.

59
00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:07.040
Shocking news from
the fashion world yesterday.

60
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.800
We have received a report

61
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.279
that Kan, the owner of Kritsana,

62
00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:15.800
was taken into custody directly
after Bangkok Fashion Week.

63
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.360
He was also said to be involved in
a contract killing.

64
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.639
The police are currently
investigating the case.

65
00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:29.480
There's also gossip about
what happened on stage.

66
00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:31.680
Young celebrity, Tanthai,

67
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.639
kissed Rarin,

68
00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:37.720
the owner of Rarin, on stage
in front of the audience.

69
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.399
Are those two together?

70
00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:43.959
I'm sorry. Tanthai's not ready
to give an interview yet.

71
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.319
Please give them some privacy.

72
00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:49.120
I'll call you once he's ready.

73
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.199
Thank you.

74
00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:53.240
I think Tan and Rin will be alright.

75
00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:56.120
We just have to give them time.

76
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.959
Even though they said
they didn't want to bother us,

77
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.879
I don't know how they're dealing
with such a big issue.

78
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Hey.

79
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.360
Tan?

80
00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:21.720
You just can't keep
lazing around like that.

81
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.360
You've skipped all the meals.

82
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.800
You look terrible.

83
00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:27.639
Tan?

84
00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:34.600
Just let me be.

85
00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:41.799
You know you won't change Rin's mind
by doing this?

86
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.519
- Mind.
- Hmm?

87
00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:51.600
Do you know about
the stage of acceptance?

88
00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:56.960
What are you talking about?

89
00:08:57.879 --> 00:08:59.279
Please leave me alone.

90
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.919
Alright.

91
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.000
But tomorrow you have to shoot a
commercial. And in the afternoon...

92
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.960
Okay, I'll leave you alone.

93
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.519
You can be alone.

94
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:36.480
Rin,

95
00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:38.879
Rung's here.

96
00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:42.399
- Thank you.
- Okay.

97
00:09:58.879 --> 00:09:59.960
Hello, Rung.

98
00:10:06.639 --> 00:10:09.090
I know about you and Tan.

99
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.090
I respect both of your decisions.

100
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.960
Thank you.

101
00:10:21.159 --> 00:10:24.840
If there's something you want to say
to Tan, you can tell me.

102
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.639
I actually invited you over today

103
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:32.039
not to talk about Tan.

104
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.919
I want to talk about this place.

105
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.720
This place?

106
00:10:52.919 --> 00:10:54.840
Rung, do you like it here?

107
00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:56.600
Here?

108
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.519
It's nice. Why?

109
00:11:03.559 --> 00:11:05.799
I'm about to embark on a journey.

110
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.279
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

111
00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:25.159
I want to go out and find
the thing I'm still missing

112
00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:29.360
and experience new things

113
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.879
for inspiration.

114
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.919
I want to follow
my own heart for once.

115
00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:42.279
But I still don't know

116
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.360
how long it's going to take.

117
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.919
It could be months

118
00:11:49.759 --> 00:11:51.039
or years.

119
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.519
I still can't say for sure.

120
00:12:08.799 --> 00:12:11.159
And I want someone

121
00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.879
I really trust

122
00:12:16.159 --> 00:12:17.840
to look after this place.

123
00:12:23.279 --> 00:12:26.039
I want you to become the CEO

124
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.799
and take over the brand for me.

125
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.720
What's going on? I don't understand.

126
00:12:54.639 --> 00:12:57.600
Even though you've forgiven me
about the collection,

127
00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:00.039
in reality,

128
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.679
I'm still partially responsible
for halting your dream.

129
00:13:03.919 --> 00:13:06.159
Reality hasn't changed.

130
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:11.879
If I could do something to
make it up to you,

131
00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:15.559
it's probably this.

132
00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.720
I think "Thai Wear Thai" is the most
appropriate for our campaign.

133
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.320
I agree. It should be interesting.

134
00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.519
Okay. Let's settled
on the title then.

135
00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:46.519
We've covered everything for today.
We'll set up another meeting later.

136
00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:47.600
Okay.

137
00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.960
Thai Wear Thai?

138
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.159
Thai Wear Thai.

139
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.960
Why did you have a big meeting about
next year's campaign without me?

140
00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:01.519
Is that even possible?

141
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.879
If there's nothing else,
I have to excuse myself.

142
00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:06.480
How come there's nothing else?

143
00:14:07.559 --> 00:14:10.639
Because of that stupid news,
are you going to just cut me off?

144
00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:19.879
Aren't you still
under investigation?

145
00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:22.799
It's over.

146
00:14:23.759 --> 00:14:24.919
You know that I'm...

147
00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:29.960
In your eyes, am I really that bad?

148
00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:31.799
You're not going to
let me help anymore?

149
00:14:33.159 --> 00:14:34.559
Can't you spare me anything?

150
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:37.639
I think you should go, Kan.

151
00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:38.919
In this kind of situation,

152
00:14:39.399 --> 00:14:40.720
I can't let you work with us.

153
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.840
Is this a punishment?

154
00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:43.720
And what's wrong with you?

155
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.679
Why didn't you greet me
when I came in?

156
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.279
Don't you have any respect
for me anymore?

157
00:14:48.919 --> 00:14:50.559
Goodbye, Kan.

158
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.360
Alright.

159
00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:07.919
Alright!

160
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.799
Rin, everyone's waiting outside.

161
00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:49.720
I need five minutes.
I'll be out soon.

162
00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:53.120
Don't worry.
I've told everyone to wait.

163
00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:57.960
Isn't attention to detail important?

164
00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:47.080
Happy birthday,

165
00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:49.559
silly girl.

166
00:16:55.399 --> 00:16:56.960
You didn't tell me
there was a recording.

167
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.720
Uh...

168
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:05.440
I'm sorry.

169
00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:08.920
I'm not very good at talking.

170
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:11.720
I don't know how I should
make a wish for you.

171
00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.240
So I did a recording
with this plushy

172
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.359
so you can listen to it
when the weather is clear.

173
00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:22.410
I know

174
00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.559
that since we started hearing
each other's thoughts,

175
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:31.039
I didn't talk to you so nicely.

176
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.200
I'm always so self-centered.

177
00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:36.319
I'm sorry.

178
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.279
Consider this plushy
a reminder of me.

179
00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:47.890
When you need to hear my voice
but it's not raining,

180
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:51.519
just listen to this instead of me.

181
00:17:53.839 --> 00:17:56.759
Because I don't know

182
00:17:57.119 --> 00:17:59.759
when I'm going to feel
annoyed with you again.

183
00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.890
And I don't know if we're going to
see each other again.

184
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.359
I just feel

185
00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:12.410
like having you close to me,

186
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.890
I only cause you trouble.

187
00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.200
So I decided to stay away from you.

188
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.559
If you miss me...

189
00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:27.839
If you want to hear my voice,

190
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.799
you can always listen
to this recording.

191
00:18:33.319 --> 00:18:35.519
Oh, I forgot.

192
00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:38.759
For this year's birthday, I...

193
00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:42.480
Happy birthday,

194
00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:44.960
silly girl.

195
00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.839
Uh...

196
00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:50.519
I'm sorry.

197
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.680
I'm not very good at talking.

198
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.440
Please take good care of yourself.

199
00:19:09.799 --> 00:19:12.599
Please look after Rung
and the studio for me.

200
00:19:13.839 --> 00:19:14.839
Can I...

201
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.039
Can I hug you?

202
00:19:23.319 --> 00:19:24.650
I want to hug you too.

203
00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:27.599
We've worked together for so long.

204
00:19:28.119 --> 00:19:30.039
Take good care of yourself.

205
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.519
Mmm!

206
00:19:36.359 --> 00:19:37.680
Don't cry.

207
00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:40.519
I don't want to leave here crying.

208
00:19:41.279 --> 00:19:42.960
I can't help it.

209
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.359
Don't forget the souvenirs.

210
00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:48.890
Jib.

211
00:19:54.759 --> 00:19:56.799
Are you sure you don't need a lift?

212
00:19:57.319 --> 00:19:59.599
I'm sure. It's okay.

213
00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:04.079
I'm sorry I'm not able to stay
for your wedding.

214
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.890
- It's okay.
- It's fine.

215
00:20:09.319 --> 00:20:10.650
Am I gloating?

216
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.240
I'm already happy
that you made us our outfits.

217
00:20:14.119 --> 00:20:17.079
Anyway, you can call me any time
if you need anything.

218
00:20:18.839 --> 00:20:19.839
Any time?

219
00:20:21.279 --> 00:20:23.650
But not too often.
Just whenever you have a problem.

220
00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:29.359
Mmm. Thank you

221
00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:32.170
and sorry about everything.

222
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.440
Come on.

223
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.759
Don't say it as if we're not
going to see each other again.

224
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.119
Another thing,

225
00:20:45.799 --> 00:20:47.200
will you...

226
00:20:51.839 --> 00:20:54.359
be my friend forever?

227
00:20:55.839 --> 00:20:57.890
Just friends.

228
00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:07.759
Always.

229
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.720
It's nothing. We're friends.

230
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.119
- Okay.
- Just friends.

231
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.000
Good luck.

232
00:21:22.839 --> 00:21:24.519
Thanks so much, Mind.

233
00:21:24.759 --> 00:21:26.119
Look after yourself.

234
00:21:32.519 --> 00:21:33.519
I have to go now.

235
00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.170
Everyone, take care.

236
00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:41.559
Okay. Thank you very much.

237
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:46.799
- You take care too.
- Good luck, Rin.

238
00:22:15.759 --> 00:22:18.559
Your destination is Chiang Mai.
It's Gate 76.

239
00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:20.400
The boarding call is at 10:30 a.m.

240
00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.880
Thank you for using Nok Air.

241
00:22:23.519 --> 00:22:25.880
Tan, Rung is...

242
00:22:36.319 --> 00:22:37.880
Tan is...

243
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.400
I'm going to wait for you.

244
00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.400
No matter how long
it's going to take,

245
00:23:44.599 --> 00:23:45.720
I'm going to wait.

246
00:23:50.519 --> 00:23:53.039
I left something with Rung.

247
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.079
Don't forget to ask her about it.

248
00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:07.319
Will you miss me when it rains?

249
00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:10.480
Of course I will.

250
00:24:12.039 --> 00:24:13.839
I'm going to miss you

251
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.599
whether it's rainy,

252
00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:19.359
sunny,

253
00:24:20.519 --> 00:24:22.200
when the snow melts,

254
00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.519
or when the flowers bloom.

255
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.839
You're so cheesy.

256
00:24:32.599 --> 00:24:33.839
And do you love me?

257
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.240
Of course I do.

258
00:24:57.279 --> 00:24:58.480
Forever.

259
00:25:24.519 --> 00:25:25.680
Do you hear me?

260
00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:28.880
Forever.

261
00:25:58.599 --> 00:26:03.240
(The only one outfit in the world
that I promised)

262
00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.759
(I will miss you
and your voice forever)

263
00:26:06.759 --> 00:26:07.759
(From Rarin)

264
00:26:13.839 --> 00:26:16.079
I know.
There's a fitting today, right?

265
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.359
I'll meet you at the same place.

266
00:26:18.839 --> 00:26:20.640
I won't be late, Mind.

267
00:26:21.359 --> 00:26:22.960
I'm not my old self anymore.

268
00:26:24.039 --> 00:26:25.799
Okay, I'll see you later.

269
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.440
(Two years later)

270
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.519
You're here, Tanthai.

271
00:27:17.319 --> 00:27:18.559
Hello, Da.

272
00:27:19.799 --> 00:27:21.039
Please come inside.

273
00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.160
Let's continue.

274
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.200
All done.

275
00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:45.559
Oh.

276
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.839
How is it, Tan? Does this look okay?

277
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.440
It does.

278
00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.480
Now that you're a director,
you have to comment more than that!

279
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.160
Alright. I'll give you
another chance.

280
00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:59.400
What do you think?
Is it really okay?

281
00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.839
It's really okay.

282
00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:04.440
But if you want me to say more,

283
00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:06.079
then thank you

284
00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.640
for accepting the female lead role
in my first movie.

285
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.400
It's okay.

286
00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.839
Thank you as well
for choosing me to be in it,

287
00:28:16.319 --> 00:28:17.799
Mr. Director.

288
00:28:21.079 --> 00:28:22.960
Now that I'm in this position

289
00:28:23.799 --> 00:28:27.039
I understand the way our former
directors' used to feel.

290
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.480
You deserve it.

291
00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.960
Prim.

292
00:28:33.839 --> 00:28:36.720
Come on, I was only joking.

293
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.240
Hello, Mr. Tan.

294
00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:51.039
Hello.

295
00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:53.079
I can call you Mr. Tan, right?

296
00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.720
You can't.

297
00:28:55.799 --> 00:28:56.799
Tan.

298
00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.200
- You're being cheeky.
- Does it fit you properly, Ken?

299
00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.400
- Rung.
- Tan.

300
00:29:03.839 --> 00:29:06.039
This is Ken, my new muse.

301
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.720
Oh.

302
00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.240
How was it? Does it fit?

303
00:29:10.599 --> 00:29:11.599
It's fine.

304
00:29:11.799 --> 00:29:14.480
I feel very handsome wearing it.

305
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.200
You really are something.

306
00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.559
It's good you feel handsome.

307
00:29:18.559 --> 00:29:22.880
Let's talk about the opening
of the new collection next week.

308
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.799
- That's all for today.
- Okay.

309
00:29:25.799 --> 00:29:26.920
Keep going.

310
00:29:27.359 --> 00:29:28.759
Stay with her longer than I did.

311
00:29:31.839 --> 00:29:32.960
Of course.

312
00:29:37.319 --> 00:29:38.319
Where did you find him?

313
00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:43.079
- You've got chemistry.
- Good, isn't it?

314
00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:45.559
Do you want some?

315
00:29:47.839 --> 00:29:49.559
Ken is quite the charmer.

316
00:29:50.759 --> 00:29:52.200
I can't beat him.

317
00:29:52.599 --> 00:29:54.759
You can't beat him?

318
00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.279
My brother is the best muse
for Rarin.

319
00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.200
You're flattering me.

320
00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:03.559
Other people might hear
and complain.

321
00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.920
I was being sarcastic.

322
00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.519
Oh.

323
00:30:06.519 --> 00:30:10.319
Do you care about your image now?

324
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:16.200
You're getting scarier by the day.

325
00:30:16.599 --> 00:30:17.880
I'm already scary.

326
00:30:19.599 --> 00:30:21.319
- Rung.
- Hmm?

327
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.240
Thank you for everything
you've done for Rin.

328
00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.079
I actually have to thank her.

329
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.400
Anyway, have you heard
any news about...

330
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.440
Tan,

331
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:41.039
you promised me you're going to
walk the runway for me

332
00:30:41.039 --> 00:30:43.160
during the fashion show next week.

333
00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.799
Don't you dare forget that!

334
00:30:46.319 --> 00:30:48.119
But I haven't done that
in a while now.

335
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.640
I don't know if I can handle it.

336
00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.559
Don't worry.

337
00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.240
I'll give you an intensive class.

338
00:30:53.559 --> 00:30:56.759
Say hello.

339
00:30:56.759 --> 00:30:58.279
How are you?

340
00:30:58.279 --> 00:30:59.759
Don't touch. You're full of germs.

341
00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.519
How possessive.

342
00:31:01.519 --> 00:31:05.240
Even though I'm looking after Prim
now, I'm still your manager.

343
00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.160
I won't let you embarrass me.

344
00:31:09.519 --> 00:31:11.839
That's right. Listen to my wife.

345
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.119
And you should take care of your kid
at home and not come here.

346
00:31:15.119 --> 00:31:16.839
My hands might not be free,
but my legs are.

347
00:31:16.839 --> 00:31:18.880
Stop! Stop!

348
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.839
Just take care of the kid.

349
00:31:21.119 --> 00:31:22.359
We've talked about this.

350
00:31:22.359 --> 00:31:24.400
Okay. Don't cry.

351
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.519
Tan, you're going to Phuket, right?

352
00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.519
Mmm. I'll be back in a few days.

353
00:31:32.519 --> 00:31:34.039
Check the forecast too.

354
00:31:34.039 --> 00:31:36.079
There might be a storm.
I'm afraid it will be raining.

355
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.279
You know

356
00:31:39.839 --> 00:31:41.640
I like rain.

357
00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.640
What are you smiling about?

358
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.640
Rung, should we talk
about Tan's work?

359
00:31:53.839 --> 00:31:56.160
That's true. Let's talk over there.

360
00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.039
You might catch a cold if it rains.

361
00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.720
No touching!

362
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.160
- Should I help you?
- Leave me alone!

363
00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.880
No need for revision
on Tanthai's part.

364
00:32:09.319 --> 00:32:11.640
I'm trying to tweak this...

365
00:32:42.359 --> 00:32:44.119
We're here!

366
00:32:44.119 --> 00:32:45.200
Let's go.

367
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.720
That took ages!

368
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:48.319
Let's get out.

369
00:32:48.799 --> 00:32:50.400
Time waits for no one. Hurry.

370
00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.960
Whoa.

371
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.200
- Aek.
- Yes?

372
00:33:00.319 --> 00:33:02.880
Can I just check out the beach or
do I need to talk to someone first?

373
00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.319
You can. But for the fishermen...

374
00:33:06.519 --> 00:33:08.160
Okay. Let's go.

375
00:33:08.359 --> 00:33:10.160
How many places
are we going to look at today?

376
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.720
- Three.
- Three?

377
00:33:11.839 --> 00:33:14.799
Two of those beaches over there
and one more at that end.

378
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.920
Let's head over there first.
We'll talk later.

379
00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.440
- Hello.
- Hello.

380
00:33:21.759 --> 00:33:24.000
What is this for?

381
00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.319
Fishing.

382
00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.599
Oh, fishing.

383
00:33:27.799 --> 00:33:29.480
Should we use it as a prop?

384
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.559
Sure.

385
00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:33.359
Can you discuss this with him?
We'll use it as a prop.

386
00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.680
Please help.

387
00:33:35.519 --> 00:33:39.240
- Let's check out the beach.
- Okay.

388
00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.559
That's not it.

389
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:45.799
It might be difficult to film.

390
00:33:46.279 --> 00:33:48.279
We might have to shoot on a boat
in the morning.

391
00:33:48.519 --> 00:33:49.759
On a boat?

392
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.440
That sounds good.

393
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.759
- The angle on the right.
- Over there?

394
00:33:54.759 --> 00:33:56.279
So the hotels won't be in the frame.

395
00:33:58.359 --> 00:34:00.519
But the sun doesn't
rise in this direction.

396
00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:15.159
Should we shoot Scene 8 here?

397
00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:18.639
- This side?
- Should we let them talk here?

398
00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:19.639
Okay.

399
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.679
He's going to drive
the boat for us, right?

400
00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:25.769
Of course.

401
00:34:31.289 --> 00:34:33.159
- Hello, Mister.
- Hello.

402
00:34:33.519 --> 00:34:36.960
I'm looking for a local actor
to be in my movie.

403
00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.719
Do you know anyone?

404
00:34:39.289 --> 00:34:40.679
Do you want someone beautiful?

405
00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:42.289
Anyone is fine.

406
00:34:42.719 --> 00:34:44.199
Who's the male lead?

407
00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:47.000
It's me.

408
00:34:47.519 --> 00:34:49.920
You're handsome. I thought you were
going to let me take the role.

409
00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.039
I was kidding.

410
00:34:52.039 --> 00:34:54.480
Can I put you in the scene as well?

411
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.599
Sure. But I can't act.

412
00:34:56.599 --> 00:34:57.769
- You can't?
- No.

413
00:34:57.769 --> 00:34:58.840
- I'm embarrassed.
- Embarrassed?

414
00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.039
- That's right.
- Of whom?

415
00:35:00.039 --> 00:35:02.329
- The female lead.
- Do you know who she is?

416
00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.119
I saw her on TV.

417
00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.960
Just a second.

418
00:35:37.769 --> 00:35:39.559
- Tan.
- Yes?

419
00:35:39.559 --> 00:35:41.360
- Should we determine the blocking?
- Sure.

420
00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.719
Your clothes are beautiful.

421
00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.559
Who made it?

422
00:36:01.199 --> 00:36:03.360
That lady made them for us.

423
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.039
Tan, a moment.

424
00:36:17.769 --> 00:36:21.360
Can I discuss Scene 15 and 16?
Can I combine them?

425
00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.880
I think we should.

426
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.239
- Sounds good.
- Good?

427
00:36:24.239 --> 00:36:26.039
- Sure.
- Scene 15 and 16.

428
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.809
Fifteen. The female lead enters.

429
00:36:35.719 --> 00:36:36.719
Rob!

430
00:36:41.769 --> 00:36:45.159
Let's go, everyone. We'll finish
the blocking inside, Tan.

431
00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:46.360
Come on.

432
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:47.920
With Scene 15...

433
00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:49.480
Oh?

434
00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.360
Tan, come on!

435
00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.679
We might be late!
Let's finish the blocking.

436
00:37:01.079 --> 00:37:03.159
Ah, it's raining!

437
00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.769
Let's wait it out.
I'll book the rooms.

438
00:37:08.039 --> 00:37:10.239
- Hello.
- Hello, I'd like to book a room.

439
00:37:10.239 --> 00:37:11.840
Please come this way.

440
00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.639
Here they are.
Let's go up to our rooms.

441
00:37:32.039 --> 00:37:33.440
You're staying with Pao.

442
00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.599
Tan, you're alone.

443
00:37:35.809 --> 00:37:36.880
Thank you.

444
00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.679
Rob, you're staying with me.

445
00:37:38.809 --> 00:37:42.119
Let's go up first.
And we have a meeting at 5 p.m.

446
00:37:42.239 --> 00:37:44.039
As for you, Tanthai,

447
00:37:44.519 --> 00:37:45.519
I...

448
00:37:51.119 --> 00:37:52.119
We'll talk later.

449
00:38:11.639 --> 00:38:13.719
Do you need any help, sir?

450
00:38:16.079 --> 00:38:17.880
When was this painted?

451
00:38:18.239 --> 00:38:20.880
Around last year.

452
00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:24.880
Is everything okay?

453
00:38:26.159 --> 00:38:27.159
Yes.

454
00:38:38.639 --> 00:38:40.239
No matter how long
it's going to take,

455
00:38:43.239 --> 00:38:44.400
I'm going to wait for you.

456
00:38:46.599 --> 00:38:48.840
See? Like that.

457
00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.840
You say it like that because you're
sure she's going to come back.

458
00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.239
Give it a try.

459
00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:56.920
But

460
00:38:57.079 --> 00:38:59.880
if the female lead
really wants to go,

461
00:39:00.329 --> 00:39:03.289
shouldn't he try to hold her back
or say something?

462
00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.559
Hold her back?

463
00:39:09.199 --> 00:39:11.519
Prim, I'm being serious.

464
00:39:11.519 --> 00:39:12.809
Sorry.

465
00:39:13.119 --> 00:39:14.809
I just had a flashback.

466
00:39:19.199 --> 00:39:21.599
Anyway, let's try this. Okay?

467
00:39:22.159 --> 00:39:25.400
Alright. But I don't know
if it's going to work.

468
00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.159
Just give it a go, okay?

469
00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:31.840
- You're ready, Pai?
- Okay.

470
00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.440
Let's do another take, everyone.

471
00:39:34.519 --> 00:39:35.679
Wardrobe department,

472
00:39:35.679 --> 00:39:38.679
can you check the actor's outfit?
It's lopsided.

473
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.329
The female lead too.
Just do it in one go.

474
00:39:41.039 --> 00:39:42.480
Alright.

475
00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.559
Is the camera ready?

476
00:39:44.559 --> 00:39:46.400
Okay. Hurry up, everyone.

477
00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:26.679
What's the matter?

478
00:40:26.679 --> 00:40:27.679
Nothing.

479
00:40:28.769 --> 00:40:30.360
Smooth out the collar on his shirt.

480
00:40:32.079 --> 00:40:33.079
Sorry.

481
00:40:33.329 --> 00:40:35.880
Stop! Don't sprinkle that now!

482
00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.079
We're not filming.

483
00:40:37.079 --> 00:40:38.559
- Sorry.
- Do it after the signal.

484
00:40:39.039 --> 00:40:41.119
You're way too diligent.
Come on, everyone.

485
00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.769
Hurry up. Come on.

486
00:40:44.039 --> 00:40:45.599
Don't let anyone
who's not involved on set.

487
00:40:45.599 --> 00:40:47.440
Cameraperson, ready?
Actors, are you ready?

488
00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.920
- Yes.
- Okay. Let's go.

489
00:40:50.119 --> 00:40:53.000
- Camera!
- Up!

490
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.079
Voice in the Rain.
Scene 21. Cut 1. Take 1.

491
00:40:58.199 --> 00:41:00.400
And action!

492
00:41:02.199 --> 00:41:03.480
No matter how long
it's going to take,

493
00:41:05.559 --> 00:41:06.679
I'm going to wait.

494
00:41:08.559 --> 00:41:10.679
I'm still waiting for you.

495
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:16.289
I'm waiting for the day
you're ready to return.

496
00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.119
No matter how long
it's going to take,

497
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.239
I'm going to wait.

498
00:41:33.769 --> 00:41:35.289
Even though people

499
00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.639
are rushing forward
with their lives,

500
00:41:39.329 --> 00:41:40.480
including you,

501
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.880
who's also in a rush

502
00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:46.639
to find your dream like
everyone else,

503
00:41:48.159 --> 00:41:49.809
I'm still the same.

504
00:41:51.079 --> 00:41:52.840
I'm still the old me

505
00:41:54.329 --> 00:41:56.199
who will always wait for you.

506
00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.559
I've really missed your voice.

507
00:44:28.719 --> 00:44:29.840
Hello,

508
00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:33.840
Tanthai.

509
00:44:43.079 --> 00:44:45.480
Hello, Rarin.

510
00:44:52.199 --> 00:44:53.199
Rin,

511
00:44:53.639 --> 00:44:55.920
I have so many things to tell you.

512
00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.880
I do too. You don't know
what I've been through.

513
00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.199
- But I want to tell you...
- Rin,

514
00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:05.960
marry...
