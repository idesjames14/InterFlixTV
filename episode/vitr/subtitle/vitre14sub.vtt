00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.079
Rin, I'm sorry for blaming you
for everything.

2
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.319
I just realized that I never really
held a grudge against you.

3
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.920
I kept fighting
until I created a new collection.

4
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.959
But in the end, Kan stole it anyway.

5
00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:54.920
It's good Anya told me
the truth today.

6
00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.879
It helped me remember everything.

7
00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:59.000
Anya?

8
00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.719
- Really?
- Mmm.

9
00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.359
She's one of the few in the business
who knows about this.

10
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.960
If Kan really stole your idea,

11
00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:14.639
there must be proof,

12
00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.530
like a sketchbook
or something you designed.

13
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.719
Can you remember which one?

14
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.479
It's lost.
I've already tried finding it.

15
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.199
Sao used to tell me
information about you.

16
00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.879
She's probably read
all of your journals.

17
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.159
She might've kept the last one.

18
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.840
Oh? Why would she keep it?

19
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.680
Don't worry.

20
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.800
I believe we're going to
get through this.

21
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.560
What's up with you, Mind?

22
00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:26.759
Nothing.

23
00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:29.840
I was just thinking. Don't mind me.

24
00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.479
What were you thinking? Tell us.

25
00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.120
I just thought that

26
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.520
a lot of things have happened

27
00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.960
in this short period of time.

28
00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.800
And they're difficult
to get through as well.

29
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
But

30
00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:52.719
we all got through it.

31
00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.479
So,

32
00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.319
I feel like we're family.

33
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.199
See? I shouldn't have said it.

34
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.599
Well, isn't it like that?

35
00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:09.800
What now?

36
00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.360
We've always been, haven't we?

37
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.399
A family.

38
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.759
That's a cool verdict.

39
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.879
Since we're family,

40
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.959
take a bite of the noodles
to swear allegiance.

41
00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.610
- I don't want to.
- No?

42
00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.050
Why? Isn't anyone hungry?

43
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.680
Hello, Porsch. It's good you called.
I've got many things to tell you.

44
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.050
Are you free tomorrow?
Dad wants to see us.

45
00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:00.639
I completely forgot!

46
00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.800
Mind, come and see me at home.

47
00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:05.120
I have to hang up now. I'm driving.

48
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.120
Okay.

49
00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.279
I'm sorry.

50
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.199
For what?

51
00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:21.800
I feel like I can't help you
with anything.

52
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.959
And now there's Rung's problem.

53
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.120
Tan,

54
00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:33.519
about my problem,
we're going to find a way out.

55
00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:39.319
I actually have to thank you for...

56
00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.279
For what?

57
00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:46.360
Nothing.

58
00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:54.439
You're relieved, aren't you?

59
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.279
Now you know you're not the reason
why Rung tried to kill herself?

60
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.399
Am I being too selfish

61
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.279
for feeling relieved
about something like this?

62
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.160
Not at all, Rin.

63
00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:14.959
Not at all.

64
00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:19.120
I'm also relieved about it.

65
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.879
Didn't you tell me you'd like to go
to a department store?

66
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.399
I'm sorry, Pa.
I need to do something.

67
00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:59.519
Hello.

68
00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.560
I'm here to see Kan.

69
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.759
Do you have an appointment with him?

70
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.920
- I don't.
- Please arrange one in advance

71
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.199
or you can wait here.

72
00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:13.759
I can wait.

73
00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:15.800
I've been waiting for so long now.

74
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.120
I don't mind waiting
a little bit longer.

75
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.560
Are you going to enroll here?

76
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.319
I'd like to see the syllabus first

77
00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:30.839
and also meet the teacher.

78
00:07:33.399 --> 00:07:36.079
Rung, hello.

79
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.519
- Hello, Kan.
- Hello.

80
00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:40.519
What brings you here?

81
00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:44.680
I remember you told me
I used to study here.

82
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.240
So I'd like to re-enroll.

83
00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.360
It's a pleasure.
I always welcome alumni.

84
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.120
Would you like to register first?

85
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.319
Do you mind if I take a look around?

86
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.519
I just want to reminisce and
feel the atmosphere here.

87
00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:07.519
Of course.

88
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.879
Please come this way.

89
00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:53.919
Sao,

90
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.639
I'd like to ask you something.

91
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.210
Sao,

92
00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:25.120
you have Rung's journal, don't you?

93
00:09:43.919 --> 00:09:46.639
Da? Da?

94
00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.360
Rin.

95
00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:51.450
Oh? Where's Da?

96
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.559
Da's not here today.

97
00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:56.039
I can't get a hold of her.

98
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.879
Is something the matter?
You can leave it with me.

99
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.600
Hello.

100
00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:14.519
Rin told me that

101
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.279
you've read Rung's journals.

102
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.679
I'd like to know

103
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.330
if there's a particular journal

104
00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:26.879
that Rung wrote

105
00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.759
before she tried to kill herself.

106
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.279
Sao,

107
00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:37.960
please tell me if you know anything.

108
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.519
Everyone's in trouble right now.

109
00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:46.360
And I don't know if I can help them.

110
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.210
If you're not going to do it for me,

111
00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:52.840
please do it for Rung.

112
00:11:01.279 --> 00:11:02.679
I...

113
00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.519
I don't want...

114
00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:15.919
I don't want you
and Rung to get hurt.

115
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.240
So I hid the journal.

116
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:34.279
I don't want Rung to remember
those bad things.

117
00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:44.919
How is Rarin doing?

118
00:11:48.799 --> 00:11:50.080
Rin is

119
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.519
facing a huge problem as well.

120
00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.440
Is it because of me?

121
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.519
No.

122
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.919
All of a sudden, a fashion brand

123
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.639
started selling their collection
before hers.

124
00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:14.240
And all the outfits
are identical to hers.

125
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.639
It's as if

126
00:12:18.559 --> 00:12:20.279
they stole her ideas.

127
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.240
If there's anything I can help with,

128
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.519
I have something to tell you first.

129
00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:50.840
Tomorrow, you can come in late.

130
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.240
Thank you.

131
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.120
We'll get going then.

132
00:12:57.919 --> 00:12:58.960
Okay.

133
00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:04.200
Rin, can I borrow an umbrella?

134
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.320
An umbrella?

135
00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:09.279
It's about to rain.

136
00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.320
Sure.

137
00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:17.759
The car's here. I have to go now.

138
00:13:17.759 --> 00:13:21.080
Okay. Safe travels.

139
00:13:39.799 --> 00:13:40.919
Hello.

140
00:13:43.879 --> 00:13:46.159
Do I really have to do this?

141
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.120
Are you going to make me steal
my boss' work?

142
00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:57.840
I can't do it.

143
00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.240
Okay.

144
00:14:12.759 --> 00:14:13.960
I'll try.

145
00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:20.200
I'll contact you later.

146
00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:44.720
Then I went inside to see Rarin

147
00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:49.759
and I did something bad.

148
00:14:51.879 --> 00:14:53.360
I'm sorry.

149
00:14:55.159 --> 00:14:56.440
Da?

150
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.360
Would she even do
something of the sort?

151
00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.480
I want to hurry over and work.

152
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.039
No, you can't.

153
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.679
If you're overworked,
it will take a toll on your health.

154
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.200
I'll take a quick nap

155
00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:19.240
and then I'll be able to work.

156
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.519
Okay.

157
00:16:34.879 --> 00:16:39.080
But we still don't have evidence
proving that Da did it.

158
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.799
But according to Sao

159
00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.720
and judging from Da's absence today,

160
00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:47.480
it's probably...

161
00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:51.679
What if Da runs away?
What are we going to do?

162
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.200
What if she tries to kill herself?

163
00:16:55.399 --> 00:16:56.399
Jib,

164
00:16:57.159 --> 00:16:58.320
calm down.

165
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.159
We'll have to find her first.

166
00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.599
As you can see,

167
00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:17.039
our fashion design school
is standardized.

168
00:17:17.039 --> 00:17:18.119
Hello.

169
00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:20.119
Our unique teaching style

170
00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:22.650
helps students become
truly immersed in fashion.

171
00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:26.759
But consequently,
each course is quite pricey.

172
00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:31.559
Because we also take students
on overseas excursions.

173
00:17:37.359 --> 00:17:39.200
Should we keep going?

174
00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.480
Please.

175
00:17:42.839 --> 00:17:46.559
There's another room. I wasn't sure
at first if I should show it to you.

176
00:17:47.519 --> 00:17:49.559
It's all of my work,

177
00:17:50.559 --> 00:17:52.440
both old and new collections.

178
00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.200
This room.

179
00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:56.279
Can I take a look?

180
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.170
They're my treasured possessions.

181
00:18:01.279 --> 00:18:04.480
I can't let outsiders in
that easily,

182
00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:07.839
especially if they still have
connections to other brands.

183
00:18:10.279 --> 00:18:11.720
If you go in there,

184
00:18:12.599 --> 00:18:14.650
I guess you should know
how to behave.

185
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:22.720
Pa, I'm thirsty.

186
00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.200
Can you get me some water?

187
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.480
Of course. I'll buy some for you.

188
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:38.170
Please.

189
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.559
What do you think
of Kritsana's collection?

190
00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:05.359
It's different from what you've seen
from other brands, right?

191
00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:19.960
Especially this collection,

192
00:19:21.079 --> 00:19:22.119
"Queen."

193
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:26.119
When women wear it,

194
00:19:26.519 --> 00:19:27.519
they can feel the power.

195
00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:30.799
It's not just beautiful
but also elegant.

196
00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:37.519
Where did you get the inspiration

197
00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:40.599
for this collection?

198
00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:48.410
Why are you saying
as if you don't know who I am?

199
00:19:49.119 --> 00:19:50.599
Why are you asking me that?

200
00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.000
You know I can't
really remember much.

201
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.039
I forgot. I'm sorry.

202
00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.960
For me, the word "queen" refers to

203
00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:09.279
the queen of fashion.

204
00:20:11.319 --> 00:20:12.680
The queen of everything.

205
00:20:15.319 --> 00:20:16.720
Queen of Rainbow.

206
00:20:17.559 --> 00:20:19.440
Have you ever heard of that name?

207
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.200
Really?

208
00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:30.680
She's not there?

209
00:20:33.119 --> 00:20:35.170
Okay. Thank you.

210
00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:43.079
You should take a break.

211
00:20:44.279 --> 00:20:45.890
It's okay. I want to help.

212
00:20:46.039 --> 00:20:48.650
Jib, I'd like to be alone.

213
00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:03.920
As for the journal,

214
00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:07.319
it's not with me.

215
00:21:08.599 --> 00:21:10.200
I never took it.

216
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.960
It's always been in your room.

217
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.200
Rung,

218
00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.279
is there anything
you'd like to tell me?

219
00:22:09.519 --> 00:22:11.480
I'll get to the point then.

220
00:22:12.599 --> 00:22:15.640
Do you remember what happened
three years ago

221
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.200
and what you did to me?

222
00:22:31.799 --> 00:22:33.640
Please be careful what you say.

223
00:22:36.279 --> 00:22:38.079
I have the right to sue you
for slander

224
00:22:39.319 --> 00:22:42.400
with an empty accusation like that.

225
00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.680
If there's nothing to hide,

226
00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:51.720
then there's no need to be afraid.

227
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:57.720
You're a funny person, Rung.

228
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:03.200
How can someone like me
do something like that?

229
00:23:04.839 --> 00:23:05.839
Hmm?

230
00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:08.519
Besides,

231
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.160
"afraid" isn't part of
my vocabulary.

232
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:30.400
Are you interested in checking out
other rooms?

233
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.599
There are other interesting ones.
I can give you a tour.

234
00:23:34.119 --> 00:23:36.640
It's okay. I think I should go now.

235
00:23:37.319 --> 00:23:38.680
Thank you very much, Kan.

236
00:23:52.319 --> 00:23:53.559
Just a moment, Rung.

237
00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.160
It's Mind.

238
00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.319
Hello, Mind.

239
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.240
Oh, Rung is...

240
00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:11.200
She's out buying some new clothes.

241
00:24:12.319 --> 00:24:14.680
We'll be home soon. Don't worry.

242
00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:23.160
Buying new clothes?

243
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.480
Okay. I'll see you later.

244
00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.599
- Mind.
- Yes?

245
00:24:44.599 --> 00:24:45.640
Everyone's waiting.

246
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.200
Please come in.

247
00:25:00.079 --> 00:25:02.079
Oh, you're here.

248
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.440
Hello.

249
00:25:09.319 --> 00:25:11.400
I'm sorry it's last minute.

250
00:25:14.599 --> 00:25:16.759
- You're Mind?
- Yes, sir.

251
00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.359
Come closer.

252
00:25:25.519 --> 00:25:27.799
When did Porsch propose to you?

253
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.519
He didn't. I proposed to him.

254
00:25:52.599 --> 00:25:53.839
The look in your eyes

255
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.440
is identical to my wife's.

256
00:25:58.519 --> 00:25:59.880
Is that a good thing?

257
00:26:00.079 --> 00:26:01.359
It is.

258
00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.200
By the looks of it,

259
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.519
you can be quite sassy.

260
00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.960
My wife also proposed to me.

261
00:26:11.599 --> 00:26:14.880
Alright.
If you both love each other,

262
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.400
I'll find you

263
00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:18.599
a new auspicious date
for the wedding.

264
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.960
You're allowing us to be together?

265
00:26:37.119 --> 00:26:38.799
Right in front of your dad?

266
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.559
But this also means

267
00:26:45.759 --> 00:26:47.039
that I'll be alone, right?

268
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.559
It's not going to be like that.

269
00:26:53.559 --> 00:26:55.519
I won't let you feel lonely.

270
00:26:55.519 --> 00:26:58.759
I'm going to bring you
a grandchild to play with.

271
00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.880
Huh?

272
00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.480
Grandchild?

273
00:27:05.039 --> 00:27:06.079
Do you mean...

274
00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:07.720
Praew.

275
00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.279
Porsch, you're about to be an uncle.

276
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.359
Uncle Porsch?

277
00:27:17.039 --> 00:27:18.039
Hey!

278
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.119
Hey, rejoice! Rejoice!

279
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.519
- Congratulations, Praew.
- Rejoice!

280
00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:28.000
- Thank you.
- Hey, applause!

281
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.599
Boss Jr.!

282
00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.640
I'm going to be an uncle!

283
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.039
Dad,

284
00:27:40.319 --> 00:27:42.359
I'm sorry for interrupting.

285
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.880
It might be improper,
but can I have some time?

286
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:46.880
Just a moment.

287
00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:51.200
- Of course.
- Excuse me.

288
00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.200
Hey!

289
00:27:52.319 --> 00:27:53.559
Where are we going?

290
00:27:58.079 --> 00:27:59.519
- Porsch!
- Come on!

291
00:27:59.519 --> 00:28:01.759
- Where are you taking me?
- Come on!

292
00:28:01.759 --> 00:28:04.079
I don't have time
to be fooling around.

293
00:28:04.079 --> 00:28:05.839
Don't worry. I know everything.

294
00:28:06.559 --> 00:28:09.000
About what? Rung?

295
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
About Rin.

296
00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.200
- Rin?
- Yes, Rin.

297
00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.400
This is...

298
00:28:29.799 --> 00:28:33.119
I know that if you're
not home, you're here.

299
00:28:36.319 --> 00:28:39.839
- Pa, I have to...
- I'll wait outside.

300
00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.680
Call me if you need anything.

301
00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:50.160
I went to see Kan.

302
00:28:51.759 --> 00:28:53.319
Why did you do that?

303
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.200
I just want to confront
the past by myself.

304
00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.680
That's all.

305
00:29:07.839 --> 00:29:08.960
And how did it go?

306
00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.880
Just as we thought.

307
00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.920
He didn't slip up at all.

308
00:29:18.039 --> 00:29:20.200
You went to see Sao
today as well, didn't you?

309
00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:21.839
Rin told me everything.

310
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.240
That's right.

311
00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.400
Just as you said,

312
00:29:28.039 --> 00:29:29.559
Sao really hid it.

313
00:29:30.279 --> 00:29:31.759
The last journal.

314
00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.200
How is it?

315
00:29:53.559 --> 00:29:54.920
Just like Rung said,

316
00:29:56.039 --> 00:30:00.000
the information in this journal
isn't enough evidence.

317
00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.319
Who torn it? Was it Sao?

318
00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.799
- I don't...
- I did.

319
00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:12.960
I probably couldn't take it.

320
00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:19.480
I remember tearing the pages
with the designs for Queen.

321
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.960
What about you, Rin?
Have you talked to Da?

322
00:30:47.759 --> 00:30:50.079
I don't know where she went.

323
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.119
I couldn't find or contact her.

324
00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.440
Rin!

325
00:31:21.839 --> 00:31:23.599
How come you're like this?

326
00:31:26.359 --> 00:31:27.359
Rin,

327
00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:29.920
I...

328
00:31:33.319 --> 00:31:35.279
Let me tell you.

329
00:31:41.079 --> 00:31:43.440
I completely forgot!

330
00:31:43.799 --> 00:31:46.880
Mind, come and see me at home.

331
00:31:47.799 --> 00:31:51.319
I have to hang up now. I'm driving.

332
00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.480
Okay.

333
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.880
There's blood everywhere!

334
00:31:58.759 --> 00:32:01.000
She won't stop bleeding!

335
00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:03.559
A hit and run!

336
00:32:09.319 --> 00:32:10.640
Hey, hey!

337
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.640
It's... Da!

338
00:32:17.599 --> 00:32:18.599
Da?

339
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.440
Call an ambulance!

340
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.440
Hurry!

341
00:32:23.759 --> 00:32:25.039
Da got hit by a car.

342
00:32:25.559 --> 00:32:28.839
She should've gone to the hospital.
But she insisted on seeing you.

343
00:32:29.599 --> 00:32:33.279
So I used my connections
to call a doctor to my house.

344
00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.240
Now that she's better,
I brought her here.

345
00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.240
And why didn't you tell us earlier?

346
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.920
It's because of me.

347
00:32:41.799 --> 00:32:44.279
I asked him not to tell anyone.

348
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.240
I...

349
00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:52.119
I didn't want anyone to be worried.

350
00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:55.240
Even though I did a bad thing,

351
00:32:57.799 --> 00:32:59.279
I just thought that

352
00:32:59.839 --> 00:33:01.640
it would be better
if I just disappeared.

353
00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.720
Why do you think so?

354
00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:06.200
Because I did it.

355
00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:11.319
I stole your ideas
and gave them to Posey.

356
00:33:23.839 --> 00:33:25.640
I did everything.

357
00:33:29.599 --> 00:33:33.519
He promised me money
for my gravely sick mother.

358
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.480
And that he'd hire me.

359
00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.480
Why didn't you tell or talk to me

360
00:33:42.759 --> 00:33:44.799
when you were in trouble?

361
00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.640
You're not angry with me?

362
00:33:48.839 --> 00:33:49.960
I am.

363
00:33:55.519 --> 00:33:57.039
I'm angry with you

364
00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:02.559
because you didn't tell me
or let me help.

365
00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.400
And I won't forgive you.

366
00:34:14.079 --> 00:34:16.809
Unless you do the one thing
I'm about to ask you,

367
00:34:18.329 --> 00:34:19.960
then I'll forgive you.

368
00:34:20.769 --> 00:34:21.769
What is it?

369
00:34:23.519 --> 00:34:26.360
I will do anything if I can
atone for my crime.

370
00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:30.920
You have to

371
00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.559
get better soon

372
00:34:38.119 --> 00:34:40.119
and be my assistant again.

373
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.039
We have to go now.

374
00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:23.199
Now we have a witness
to testify against Kan.

375
00:35:23.559 --> 00:35:24.559
Right?

376
00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:25.880
That's right.

377
00:35:26.679 --> 00:35:27.719
No.

378
00:35:29.079 --> 00:35:30.289
I'm sorry

379
00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:33.840
but Da will stay out of this.

380
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.599
Think about it.

381
00:35:38.079 --> 00:35:41.920
If she becomes our witness,
what are the risks she's facing?

382
00:35:45.159 --> 00:35:47.809
Mmm. I understand.

383
00:35:49.329 --> 00:35:52.559
Why? We already have the chance.

384
00:35:53.559 --> 00:35:56.840
She doesn't want Da
to be a victim of society.

385
00:35:57.679 --> 00:36:00.400
Think about it.
If Da has to confess,

386
00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.360
it means she's admitting
that she's a traitor.

387
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:06.639
Then how is she

388
00:36:07.289 --> 00:36:10.079
going to be able to work
for other brands? Right, Rin?

389
00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:21.329
I have to excuse myself now.
There's a lot for me to think about.

390
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.599
Is anyone hungry?

391
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.769
What? If you're hungry,
you have to eat.

392
00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.599
If you want to eat, then you will.

393
00:36:50.599 --> 00:36:52.809
Two boxes of pizza
and two boxes of chicken.

394
00:36:52.809 --> 00:36:53.960
Dig in.

395
00:37:06.809 --> 00:37:08.360
I'll eat french fries then.

396
00:37:16.039 --> 00:37:17.039
Huh?

397
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.920
I'm off.

398
00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.960
What's up with him?

399
00:37:28.809 --> 00:37:31.239
Hey, what am I going to dip now?

400
00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:32.519
Oxygen?

401
00:37:32.719 --> 00:37:33.769
What do we have?

402
00:37:34.329 --> 00:37:35.329
I'm hungry.

403
00:37:36.159 --> 00:37:37.679
Give that to me.

404
00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:55.289
An army advances on a full stomach.

405
00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.199
Or do you want to eat me instead?

406
00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.289
Pervert!

407
00:38:23.639 --> 00:38:25.809
It'd be nice if it was raining.

408
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.769
Even if it rained now,

409
00:38:33.639 --> 00:38:35.639
I can't hear your voice anyway.

410
00:38:37.039 --> 00:38:38.360
Also,

411
00:38:39.239 --> 00:38:41.679
I won't have it
as my inspiration anymore.

412
00:38:47.719 --> 00:38:49.639
Actually, I've always wondered

413
00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.400
about you using
my voice as your inspiration.

414
00:38:57.159 --> 00:38:58.519
What do you mean?

415
00:39:00.769 --> 00:39:05.960
I never thought my voice could
do something amazing like that.

416
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:09.719
It probably just

417
00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:15.239
helps you to express
your own feelings honestly.

418
00:39:15.639 --> 00:39:16.639
That's all.

419
00:39:18.329 --> 00:39:21.769
I think when you're
designing clothes,

420
00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.880
there must already
be something on your mind.

421
00:39:27.329 --> 00:39:28.769
Something on my mind?

422
00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.960
Mmm.

423
00:39:32.519 --> 00:39:35.360
Even if there are hundreds of people
plagiarizing you,

424
00:39:36.329 --> 00:39:37.440
in the end,

425
00:39:37.719 --> 00:39:40.159
there's only you who can say

426
00:39:40.639 --> 00:39:42.809
why you designed those clothes.

427
00:39:46.719 --> 00:39:50.239
Do you know what Rung
wrote on the last page?

428
00:39:51.039 --> 00:39:52.769
The one that wasn't torn out?

429
00:39:55.639 --> 00:39:57.039
I remember it so well.

430
00:40:01.329 --> 00:40:02.679
The fashion world

431
00:40:04.329 --> 00:40:05.719
has never shown me mercy.

432
00:40:08.719 --> 00:40:11.679
I designed this collection
in my name.

433
00:40:12.599 --> 00:40:13.719
My birth name.

434
00:40:17.239 --> 00:40:20.480
Even though it was stolen right
in front of my eyes in the end,

435
00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:23.840
the person who stole it

436
00:40:25.559 --> 00:40:27.289
only got an empty shell.

437
00:40:30.769 --> 00:40:33.960
Perhaps I let
those outfits lead the way.

438
00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.809
Because they're my queen.

439
00:40:43.289 --> 00:40:44.559
I'm Rung.

440
00:40:46.039 --> 00:40:47.519
Queen of Rainbow.

441
00:41:01.289 --> 00:41:02.920
Thank you very much, Tan.

442
00:41:37.769 --> 00:41:38.769
Tan,

443
00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.639
I just came up with something.

444
00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.360
Mmm.

445
00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:53.920
Oh?

446
00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.480
Tan?

447
00:41:56.809 --> 00:41:58.119
I'm sorry.

448
00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.360
I got it!

449
00:42:42.239 --> 00:42:43.239
The models...

450
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.809
Hold on.

451
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.289
Chew and swallow first.

452
00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.559
The models get tired
after the runway.

453
00:42:52.559 --> 00:42:55.920
Therefore, our concept
is the value pack.

454
00:42:56.239 --> 00:42:58.329
Take this and put it on the outfit.

455
00:42:58.329 --> 00:43:01.239
When the models get hungry,
they can just take a bite.

456
00:43:01.239 --> 00:43:03.599
Genius!

457
00:43:03.599 --> 00:43:05.400
You're so clever.

458
00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.920
They can take a bite...
Are you crazy?

459
00:43:09.519 --> 00:43:12.480
I know how I should deal with them.

460
00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.769
I'm going to use the whole set

461
00:43:17.769 --> 00:43:20.920
without modifying
the pattern or anything.

462
00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.809
Because I'm going to directly
confront Posey...

463
00:43:24.329 --> 00:43:25.329
No.

464
00:43:25.809 --> 00:43:28.920
I'm going to
confront Kritsana directly.

465
00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:30.840
- OMG.
- OMG.

466
00:43:31.239 --> 00:43:32.239
Uh-oh.

467
00:43:35.639 --> 00:43:39.119
Because what they stole
are only the outer shells.

468
00:43:40.039 --> 00:43:42.159
But they can't steal their souls.

469
00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:43.960
Isn't that right?

470
00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.519
Tomorrow,

471
00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.360
I also invited the owner of Posey
to be in the front row.

472
00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.320
Hello.

473
00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:18.119
Are you showcasing your plagiarized
outfit today as well?

474
00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.840
They're identical. Look.

475
00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:26.000
Why are they so similar?

476
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.760
To put it simply, you're stupid

477
00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.679
for falling for my tricks
in this harsh capitalist society.
