1
00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:51.879
What?

2
00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:54.040
Nothing.

3
00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:56.359
I'm just here to check up on you.

4
00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.280
So you know that you have me
by your side.

5
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.480
Hmpf.

6
00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:19.090
Here. Let me help.

7
00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.439
Tan!

8
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.400
What are you doing?

9
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.599
It's stained now.

10
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.560
Oh? You weren't going
to paint the walls?

11
00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:30.879
No.

12
00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.960
Well, I...

13
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.680
I just don't know

14
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.599
what to do next.

15
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.560
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.319
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

17
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.280
You're being childish.

18
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.800
What's up with you?

19
00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.719
Let me have the brush.

20
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.800
I know.

21
00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:37.479
Thank you for talking to Dad for me.

22
00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:40.560
I'll apologize to Cindy myself.

23
00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.599
Huh?

24
00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.240
Are you for real?

25
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.879
Okay.

26
00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.199
Praew told me

27
00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.439
Dad's going to cancel the wedding.

28
00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.479
You want me, don't you?

29
00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.919
- Am I being too happy?
- Definitely.

30
00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.170
Dad also wants to see us both.

31
00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:18.839
Really?

32
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.240
Are we going to get killed and
tossed into the Gulf of Thailand?

33
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.399
I don't think so. It'll probably be
the Andaman Sea.

34
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.480
Shut up and go home.

35
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.610
How can I?

36
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.399
No one's here right now either.

37
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.170
Right here on the sofa.

38
00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:36.439
Come here!

39
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.879
Hey! Wait, wait!

40
00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:41.319
Oops.

41
00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:43.360
Sorry.

42
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.480
When did you get here?

43
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.759
When?

44
00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:47.730
I didn't notice you come in.

45
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.839
I'm just here to tell you
that I'm going out for a bit.

46
00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.959
- Alone?
- Mmm.

47
00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:55.399
Should I come with you?

48
00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:57.759
Look at this.

49
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.730
I've gotten much stronger now.

50
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.439
Mmm. Look at those guns.

51
00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:06.170
I'll reverse it myself.

52
00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:08.959
She's doing it herself!

53
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.279
I want one too.

54
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.050
It's not much further after we cross
this intersection.

55
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.879
Are you crossing the road?

56
00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:27.050
Can I help you?

57
00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:34.360
Please? I'm doing
good deeds right now

58
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.560
so I can write it down
in my Diary of Good Deeds.

59
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.439
A diary?

60
00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:48.160
Are you okay?

61
00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.240
Rung? Do you have a headache?

62
00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.759
Let's go home then.

63
00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:57.279
I hope you get better soon.

64
00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.399
It's a shame.

65
00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.079
I can't hear your voice anymore.

66
00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:19.959
My ears are feeling lonely.

67
00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:30.519
Let's find a way
to get the voice back.

68
00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:34.839
How?

69
00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:48.720
Wait here.

70
00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:57.560
I love you!

71
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.160
Are you crazy? It's embarrassing!

72
00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:06.680
No one's going to pay attention
to us in this rain.

73
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.560
The power might return if we
profess our love out loud.

74
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.759
I love you! Can you hear me?

75
00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:19.560
I love you the most!

76
00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:25.000
I love you too!

77
00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.959
Can you hear me?

78
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.120
Rarin is the cutest!

79
00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:53.680
Too bad it didn't work.

80
00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:55.319
Mmm.

81
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.360
The power probably
won't return easily.

82
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.199
Are you okay?

83
00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:28.160
Do you want some painkillers?

84
00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:31.199
Mmm.

85
00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:52.450
You're not going to take it anymore?

86
00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:58.240
It's you.

87
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:00.360
You are my painkiller.

88
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:33.600
Are you up,

89
00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.399
my painkiller?

90
00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:39.759
Mmm!

91
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.720
What painkiller?

92
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.039
What are you thinking?

93
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.000
Why are you making that face?

94
00:09:58.399 --> 00:09:59.639
Take a guess.

95
00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:04.919
Hmm.

96
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.120
You want to...

97
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.240
take a dump?

98
00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:22.960
What kind of guess is that?

99
00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.720
I was just thinking...

100
00:10:29.799 --> 00:10:32.840
why my girlfriend is so cute?

101
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.360
Mmm!

102
00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:36.279
What girlfriend?

103
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.450
You haven't officially
asked me out yet.

104
00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:42.210
But I think after last night,

105
00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:45.519
it's a bit too late for that.

106
00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:48.090
- Mmm!
- Ow!

107
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:03.840
But I still

108
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.360
want to hear it from you.

109
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.799
For some things,

110
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.440
it's better to hear it.

111
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.360
Okay.

112
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.799
I'll do it.

113
00:11:26.759 --> 00:11:27.799
Just a sec.

114
00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:36.799
Are you ready?

115
00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:39.039
I am.

116
00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:42.879
Rarin,

117
00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:46.320
can you be

118
00:11:49.039 --> 00:11:53.519
the person who snores
right next to me every night?

119
00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:55.200
Ugh!

120
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.679
If you're going to do it,
do it properly!

121
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.679
Well, you were snoring
the whole night.

122
00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:09.279
What kind of boyfriend
teases his girlfriend like this?

123
00:12:09.799 --> 00:12:10.799
Are you sulking?

124
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.240
Ugh!

125
00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:14.480
Haven't you heard that
the more you love,

126
00:12:15.159 --> 00:12:18.000
- the more you tease?
- Not at all.

127
00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:20.639
The more you love someone,

128
00:12:20.759 --> 00:12:23.919
the more you should
take care of them.

129
00:12:24.759 --> 00:12:28.720
Be a gentleman. Be respectful.
And don't be fussy.

130
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.279
Now that's my prince.

131
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:37.799
Then, between me

132
00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:40.200
and your prince,

133
00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:42.879
who do you love more?

134
00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:47.399
My prince, of course.

135
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.759
Are you serious?

136
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.320
Aw!

137
00:12:54.679 --> 00:12:57.360
- What?
- Go! Go and take a shower!

138
00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.919
- You've got gunk in your eyes.
- Get off!

139
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.200
Go!

140
00:13:11.679 --> 00:13:14.639
Did Rin draw this herself?
It's so cute.

141
00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:17.320
Tan helped me.

142
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.320
That's why I can feel the love aura
exuding from it.

143
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.240
Jib, hold your horses. It's me.

144
00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.360
Let's get back to work, Da.

145
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.440
I just realized that you're prone
to embarrassment.

146
00:13:41.879 --> 00:13:44.480
You should get ready
for the fitting.

147
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.480
I'm thinking of taking you
out for dinner.

148
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:49.480
What dinner?

149
00:13:52.679 --> 00:13:53.919
Ta-da.

150
00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.159
It's a party organized by Gorgeous.

151
00:13:56.679 --> 00:14:00.879
It's a small event where
the designers for BFW were invited.

152
00:14:01.279 --> 00:14:05.039
So I'm thinking of
taking you with me.

153
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.919
Don't worry. I already asked Mind
about your schedule.

154
00:14:08.919 --> 00:14:10.519
She said you're free.

155
00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.240
I just realized that you like
to show off your boyfriend.

156
00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:18.919
I don't.

157
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.000
I'm taking you as the muse.

158
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.360
Hurry on over, okay?

159
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.559
March 16,

160
00:15:19.679 --> 00:15:22.720
I'm so proud that my outfit
won first place

161
00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.759
for Best National Costume
at Miss Thailand.

162
00:15:27.159 --> 00:15:29.279
June 25,

163
00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:32.440
I can't believe one of
the outfits in my first collection

164
00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:35.120
is identical to another
newly-founded brand.

165
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.279
July 31,

166
00:15:49.279 --> 00:15:53.039
the collection for the opening
of my brand is almost completed.

167
00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:55.120
It's more perfect than I thought.

168
00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.600
I was a little concerned
so I emailed a fashion expert.

169
00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:05.320
I suspect something
so I'm thinking of investigating.

170
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.799
But I'm scared to face reality

171
00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:08.919
if my suspicion turns out
to be true.

172
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.279
Are there any other diaries?

173
00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:31.600
Tan, are you done?

174
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:34.480
I'm tying my bow-tie.

175
00:16:37.759 --> 00:16:38.759
Here.

176
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.200
- I'll do it for you.
- Okay.

177
00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:12.650
Okay.

178
00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.759
What do you think?

179
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.599
- Well...
- You should lose the jacket.

180
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.440
- Lose the jacket?
- Mmm.

181
00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.119
Let's take it off.

182
00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:38.599
Better.

183
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.599
I think the jacket makes it look

184
00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:44.759
too deliberate.

185
00:17:46.839 --> 00:17:48.240
Hmm.

186
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.759
Just wear these?

187
00:17:53.359 --> 00:17:54.519
I'll be right back.

188
00:17:54.519 --> 00:17:56.920
Let's add something.

189
00:18:20.839 --> 00:18:23.410
I heard there was a fire
at your studio?

190
00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:27.200
I was shocked when I heard the news.

191
00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:30.519
Yes, there was a bit of an accident.

192
00:18:30.519 --> 00:18:32.170
But it's fine now.

193
00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:34.599
Just tell me if you need my help.

194
00:18:35.559 --> 00:18:37.119
Thank you, Kan.

195
00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:40.519
And how's preparation going?

196
00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:42.759
Have you contacted
a modeling agency?

197
00:18:43.119 --> 00:18:44.119
Uhh...

198
00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.240
It's okay. Thank you very much.

199
00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.799
I've already partially prepared it.

200
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.960
I'm lucky I have Tanthai
as the muse.

201
00:18:55.359 --> 00:19:00.039
He's a great representation
of our brand.

202
00:19:00.359 --> 00:19:02.680
I can rest assured.

203
00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.839
I'm looking forward to seeing it.

204
00:19:07.039 --> 00:19:10.759
I'm a little surprised you managed
to bring him this far.

205
00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.410
Bring me this far? What do you mean?

206
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.170
We all know about it

207
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:20.650
that...

208
00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:30.079
Honestly,

209
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.079
I never thought a celebrity
with scandal like yours

210
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.279
could become the muse of a brand
with a sweet-style like Rarin's

211
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.680
and make...

212
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.890
No, create a nice impression.

213
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.319
It's a compliment.

214
00:19:47.039 --> 00:19:48.319
There is no hidden agenda.

215
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.440
Thank you, then.

216
00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:59.170
My muse definitely can't
compete with Tan, right Kate?

217
00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:00.720
Her?

218
00:20:01.079 --> 00:20:03.519
What does she have to
compete with him?

219
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.960
At least your muse

220
00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.519
has some respect for seniority.

221
00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:12.279
I gave my muse a few bags

222
00:20:12.279 --> 00:20:15.759
to review and she told me

223
00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.839
it's not convenient for use.

224
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.039
She's lucky I didn't reply to her

225
00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:22.279
that it's fashion, not function.

226
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.759
They're just models,
not the brand owner.

227
00:20:26.359 --> 00:20:27.359
Silly.

228
00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:28.920
You're being too harsh, Kate.

229
00:20:29.119 --> 00:20:31.480
Rin might get cocky.

230
00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.240
Right, Rin?

231
00:20:35.759 --> 00:20:39.559
Sometimes you have to be harsh
if it doesn't go the way you want.

232
00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.890
I have to go to the bathroom.

233
00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.359
Cheers, Anya.

234
00:21:10.599 --> 00:21:14.200
Thank you.
I like your new look as well.

235
00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:16.440
It's very beautiful.

236
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:26.410
Tan,

237
00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:28.559
where's your bow-tie?

238
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.519
You love me for being me.

239
00:21:41.279 --> 00:21:43.960
Or do you love me as the prince?

240
00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:49.519
Why are you asking me this now?

241
00:21:50.599 --> 00:21:52.599
Distinguish personal
from professional matters.

242
00:21:53.839 --> 00:21:55.319
Because I want to know
the answer now.

243
00:22:02.599 --> 00:22:03.599
Tan,

244
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.440
let's talk later.

245
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.279
Give me the bow-tie.
I'll tie it for you.

246
00:22:13.279 --> 00:22:14.759
What if I don't want to wear it?

247
00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:17.799
Are you going to force me?

248
00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:23.359
Tan,

249
00:22:25.319 --> 00:22:26.799
stop being silly.

250
00:22:28.799 --> 00:22:30.960
This is Gorgeous' party.

251
00:22:31.519 --> 00:22:32.680
Look,

252
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.039
there are a lot of esteemed guests.

253
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.640
I want you to look your best

254
00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.240
in everyone's eyes.

255
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.839
You can't act silly
and embarrass me.

256
00:22:50.519 --> 00:22:51.640
Listen to yourself talking.

257
00:22:52.759 --> 00:22:54.000
I might be silly

258
00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.759
and ill-mannered.

259
00:22:58.079 --> 00:23:00.680
But I just want you to love me
for being me,

260
00:23:01.599 --> 00:23:03.039
as a human being,

261
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.880
and not as a prince

262
00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.039
who follows your orders.

263
00:23:12.279 --> 00:23:13.279
Tan,

264
00:23:16.319 --> 00:23:17.960
I didn't mean it that way.

265
00:24:21.759 --> 00:24:24.839
I'm sorry but I have
to excuse myself now.

266
00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:32.480
Are you okay, Tan?

267
00:24:33.079 --> 00:24:34.119
Me?

268
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.039
I'm just a clothes hanger.

269
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.359
Please enjoy your meal.

270
00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.960
(Rarin)

271
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.720
Haven't you gone home?

272
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.519
Anya,

273
00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.759
I'm sorry for being rude earlier.

274
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:18.960
It's okay.

275
00:25:19.559 --> 00:25:21.039
I understand how you feel.

276
00:25:22.519 --> 00:25:24.680
When I was a fresh face
in the fashion world

277
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.519
around 20 to 30 years ago,

278
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.240
I wasn't used to this
extravagance either.

279
00:25:32.119 --> 00:25:34.319
I'd like to warn you

280
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:37.680
that you'll still have to face
many things in this business.

281
00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.480
Why don't you try acting casual
and indifferent like me?

282
00:25:43.039 --> 00:25:44.319
So you won't be stressed.

283
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.960
To be in this business,
it's like being cursed.

284
00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:53.880
Once you get in,
you can't find a way out

285
00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.799
until you've reached the top.

286
00:25:57.359 --> 00:26:00.160
But half of the people
die along the way.

287
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.960
Only one in a hundred
can become successful.

288
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:07.240
In my opinion,

289
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.319
Rarin is not bad at all.

290
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.640
You two have gotten
this far already.

291
00:26:13.119 --> 00:26:15.400
Don't lose faith in each other yet.

292
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.200
Okay.

293
00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.720
I don't know why so many people
like the fashion world.

294
00:26:26.599 --> 00:26:28.200
My sister as well.

295
00:26:30.759 --> 00:26:31.960
Your sister?

296
00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.880
What's her name? Maybe I know her.

297
00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.200
It's Rung.

298
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.440
Rungtiwa.

299
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.720
She didn't get to be
in the business though.

300
00:26:45.079 --> 00:26:47.079
She had an accident.

301
00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.920
Maybe the curse you mentioned
is quite powerful.

302
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.920
Hmm.

303
00:26:55.799 --> 00:26:58.279
What happened to your sister?

304
00:27:00.359 --> 00:27:01.400
She...

305
00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.440
tried to kill herself.

306
00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.680
So she went into a vegetative state
for around three years.

307
00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:12.160
But she's awake now.

308
00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.920
Oh,

309
00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:28.920
you told me to try
and be indifferent just now.

310
00:27:29.799 --> 00:27:31.319
I don't think I can do it.

311
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.200
Because being indifferent

312
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.880
just one time

313
00:27:40.079 --> 00:27:42.240
almost made me lose everything.

314
00:27:45.759 --> 00:27:48.000
- I have to excuse myself now.
- Of course.

315
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.440
Tan.

316
00:28:17.119 --> 00:28:18.519
I'm sorry.

317
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.079
I didn't know you'd overthink it.

318
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.559
Please don't leave me.

319
00:28:27.599 --> 00:28:28.720
You're the one who's overthinking.

320
00:28:29.599 --> 00:28:32.079
I won't leave you, silly.

321
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.599
You're acting as if you don't want
to be the muse

322
00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:38.279
and don't love me anymore.

323
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.960
Rin,

324
00:28:48.759 --> 00:28:49.920
listen to me.

325
00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:53.880
I love you too much

326
00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:59.160
to the point that I can't tell
the difference between work,

327
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.599
being the muse,

328
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.720
or being the prince.

329
00:29:05.559 --> 00:29:07.200
I'm all over the place.

330
00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:11.119
But that's why

331
00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.319
I can't tell things apart.

332
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.680
I have to apologize in advance

333
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.599
in case I do
something impulsive again.

334
00:29:25.839 --> 00:29:28.279
But I don't want you
to be impulsive.

335
00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:37.920
Tan,

336
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.960
didn't we agree

337
00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.079
that I'll transform you
into a perfect prince?

338
00:29:45.359 --> 00:29:47.160
We're almost there.

339
00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.519
Can't you help me a little longer?

340
00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.480
If you want it that way,

341
00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.279
I'd have to stop loving you first.

342
00:30:03.119 --> 00:30:06.960
That's the only way I'll be able
to do my best working with you.

343
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.440
Rin,

344
00:30:11.559 --> 00:30:13.400
I'm already doing my best.

345
00:30:20.519 --> 00:30:21.519
Rin?

346
00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.440
Where are you going?

347
00:30:24.319 --> 00:30:26.960
You should go.
I'll go home on my own.

348
00:30:27.279 --> 00:30:28.400
Wait, Rin!

349
00:30:29.839 --> 00:30:30.839
Rin!

350
00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.599
(Rungtiwa, Queen of Rainbow)

351
00:31:21.839 --> 00:31:22.839
Mmm.

352
00:31:24.359 --> 00:31:27.160
I'm sorry for visiting you
this late.

353
00:31:29.599 --> 00:31:31.000
It's okay.

354
00:31:32.319 --> 00:31:34.240
I guess you don't remember me.

355
00:31:40.119 --> 00:31:41.559
I'm Anya.

356
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:47.759
It's not surprising that you don't.

357
00:31:48.759 --> 00:31:50.559
We only knew each other in passing

358
00:31:50.559 --> 00:31:54.079
at the Miss Thailand costume design
competition three years ago.

359
00:31:56.119 --> 00:31:59.240
I chose your outfit
for the first place.

360
00:32:02.839 --> 00:32:06.359
Even though I don't
remember much, thank you.

361
00:32:09.119 --> 00:32:12.200
But I'd like to talk to you
about something.

362
00:32:13.839 --> 00:32:17.440
Your outfit almost didn't win.

363
00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:20.960
Pardon?

364
00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.039
Somebody lobbied
and fixed the results

365
00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.200
for that year's competition.

366
00:32:30.519 --> 00:32:34.440
But I protested and pushed
for your work to win.

367
00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.799
Is this the outfit
for the Miss Thailand competition?

368
00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.920
That's right.

369
00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.839
Not bad at all.

370
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.400
Thank you, Kan.

371
00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.920
I'm still nervous
because it's my first competition

372
00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:01.240
and the other competitors
are all veterans.

373
00:33:02.519 --> 00:33:05.920
I couldn't believe it either
when I won.

374
00:33:08.039 --> 00:33:12.640
But look, I'm the regular tailor
for Miss Thailand now.

375
00:33:14.279 --> 00:33:15.359
That's true.

376
00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:20.440
I'm proud

377
00:33:21.559 --> 00:33:22.599
to have a talented student like...

378
00:33:23.079 --> 00:33:26.599
Rung, right?

379
00:33:26.599 --> 00:33:27.599
That's right.

380
00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.000
The designer's name is Rungtiwa.

381
00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.039
That's right. She's my student.

382
00:33:39.599 --> 00:33:42.359
Can you eliminate her?

383
00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.880
That's right.
Make her lose the round.

384
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:51.680
Kan likes to destroy new brands
from getting ahead.

385
00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.279
He relies on the press
and powerful people.

386
00:33:55.839 --> 00:33:57.960
He gives the fashion world
a bad name.

387
00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.200
Darn it!

388
00:34:08.809 --> 00:34:09.809
What?

389
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.599
Kan, I'm here to say goodbye.

390
00:34:16.519 --> 00:34:17.880
Thank you for everything.

391
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.400
I know everything

392
00:34:27.329 --> 00:34:29.639
but I've always let him
get away with it.

393
00:34:32.809 --> 00:34:35.809
I was going to visit
when you had a problem.

394
00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.639
But it seems that I was late.

395
00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:42.559
Do you remember the concept
that was plagiarized?

396
00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.960
Do you mean Rarin's?

397
00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.519
Rarin's?

398
00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.960
That's not it.

399
00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:56.960
You sent me an email directly
for some advice.

400
00:34:57.769 --> 00:35:00.400
I still remember
that collection's concept well.

401
00:35:01.159 --> 00:35:04.440
You named it "Queen of Rainbow."

402
00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.809
Kritsana stole
and changed the concept.

403
00:35:08.809 --> 00:35:10.880
They've been making money
off it until now.

404
00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:21.239
It's so close now.

405
00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.599
The big day is almost here,
just a few more days.

406
00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:26.079
That's true.

407
00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:29.329
But I think I have to

408
00:35:29.639 --> 00:35:31.559
thank everyone!

409
00:35:32.769 --> 00:35:34.119
Well done!

410
00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.809
Rin, bad news!

411
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.960
There's news about our brand
copying another brand.

412
00:35:45.199 --> 00:35:47.880
Are you confirming
that you designed it?

413
00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.639
- Yes, I confirm...
- How could this happen?

414
00:35:51.639 --> 00:35:53.400
You can look at the proof.

415
00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.840
I've posted and updated
on social media

416
00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.809
before Rarin gave
an interview about it.

417
00:35:59.809 --> 00:36:02.039
It was probably around
two weeks ago.

418
00:36:02.039 --> 00:36:03.840
And I posted before that.

419
00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:07.000
I don't understand

420
00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.480
how she plagiarized it.

421
00:36:10.809 --> 00:36:15.960
Another thing I don't understand
is why a big brand like Rarin

422
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:20.599
would be bullying
a small brand like Posey.

423
00:36:21.809 --> 00:36:26.159
Rin, I think there's a mole

424
00:36:26.559 --> 00:36:28.599
who stole and leaked our design.

425
00:36:29.679 --> 00:36:32.289
It's no use trying to find out.

426
00:37:02.769 --> 00:37:03.880
Please have seat.

427
00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:06.119
I hope you didn't forget our promise

428
00:37:06.289 --> 00:37:08.599
and that you'll still let me
work for Kritsana.

429
00:37:09.559 --> 00:37:10.599
Don't worry.

430
00:37:11.289 --> 00:37:14.840
I have to accept you to work
based on your experience.

431
00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.119
- As for the pay...
- I'll transfer it to you.

432
00:37:17.289 --> 00:37:19.880
Thank you very much.
I'll get going then.

433
00:37:20.679 --> 00:37:23.880
I hope this will
be kept confidential, Da.

434
00:37:27.639 --> 00:37:29.880
But even if it gets leaked,

435
00:37:30.719 --> 00:37:33.679
the person who stole Rarin's design

436
00:37:33.679 --> 00:37:36.039
wasn't me or Posey

437
00:37:36.159 --> 00:37:37.199
but you.

438
00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:40.809
Remember that.

439
00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.639
You're soaking wet.

440
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.329
You might catch a cold.

441
00:38:16.679 --> 00:38:19.239
Why did these bad things
have to happen to me?

442
00:38:23.289 --> 00:38:25.440
Last time,
it was the fire at the studio.

443
00:38:26.519 --> 00:38:29.289
And now the news about plagiarism.

444
00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.960
Aren't I just a woman who wants
to follow her dreams?

445
00:38:38.639 --> 00:38:40.079
Is that really a bad thing?

446
00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.039
Please don't leave me.

447
00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.400
I don't care
if you're the prince or not.

448
00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.159
I still love you just the same.

449
00:39:16.769 --> 00:39:17.960
Silly girl,

450
00:39:20.639 --> 00:39:22.599
I told you that I'll love you
no matter what.

451
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.960
I won't leave you.

452
00:39:30.679 --> 00:39:32.000
Promise?

453
00:39:33.769 --> 00:39:35.960
I promise.

454
00:39:43.239 --> 00:39:44.559
Don't give up.

455
00:39:45.519 --> 00:39:48.440
I'll always be by your side.

456
00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.289
By the way, what did you call me?

457
00:40:00.769 --> 00:40:02.039
Silly girl?

458
00:40:03.519 --> 00:40:04.960
How could you call me that?

459
00:40:05.809 --> 00:40:08.079
I'm a year older than you.

460
00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.679
And do you like it?

461
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.519
It's kind of cute.

462
00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.960
Should I call you that every day?

463
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.599
Silly girl.

464
00:40:23.079 --> 00:40:24.400
Silly girl. Silly girl.

465
00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.719
That's enough.

466
00:40:27.159 --> 00:40:29.559
It sounds like a real insult when
you keep repeating it like that.

467
00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.329
Then what should I call you?

468
00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.639
Honey?

469
00:40:36.199 --> 00:40:37.360
Yuck.

470
00:40:38.119 --> 00:40:39.519
Thank you, Anya.

471
00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:41.960
There's no need to thank me.

472
00:40:42.599 --> 00:40:44.360
I actually have to apologize to you.

473
00:40:45.159 --> 00:40:46.719
I've been thinking.

474
00:40:47.289 --> 00:40:50.329
Why did I let these bad things
happen for so long?

475
00:40:51.039 --> 00:40:55.199
I probably didn't want any trouble.

476
00:40:56.079 --> 00:40:59.360
But many people were
on the receiving end of it instead.

477
00:41:00.239 --> 00:41:02.079
If I didn't come and see you today,

478
00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.079
I would regret it
for the rest of my life.

479
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.960
I still have to thank you for having
the courage to tell the truth.

480
00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.599
Because being indifferent
just one time

481
00:41:16.199 --> 00:41:18.360
almost made me lose everything.

482
00:41:20.289 --> 00:41:23.679
You have a good family.
Take care of them.

483
00:41:24.559 --> 00:41:27.960
- I'll go and see you off.
- It's okay.

484
00:41:28.289 --> 00:41:30.159
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

485
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:54.119
Rung, are you okay?

486
00:41:55.519 --> 00:41:57.329
I hope it's not going to be the same
as someone else's again.

487
00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.119
There's no need to be stressed.

488
00:42:04.079 --> 00:42:05.599
You came up with the idea first.

489
00:42:06.719 --> 00:42:08.599
I'll help you prove it.

490
00:42:10.599 --> 00:42:11.599
Sound good?

491
00:42:12.559 --> 00:42:13.719
Thank you.

492
00:42:14.519 --> 00:42:16.329
But it's okay.

493
00:42:16.769 --> 00:42:18.519
You're going to
ruin your reputation.

494
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:24.880
This could be karma

495
00:42:25.199 --> 00:42:27.239
for what I did to Rung.

496
00:42:33.559 --> 00:42:34.559
Yes, Mind?

497
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.039
Rarin's not the reason why I tried
to kill myself.

498
00:42:38.639 --> 00:42:41.840
The real reason is that my design

499
00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.809
was stolen by the person
I trusted the most.

500
00:42:46.119 --> 00:42:47.960
You stole my idea, didn't you?

501
00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.769
Please be polite.

502
00:42:50.719 --> 00:42:52.679
First of all,
they're two different concepts.

503
00:42:52.679 --> 00:42:55.840
My theme is the queen.
There's no rainbow.

504
00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.480
It's because you adapted my idea

505
00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.719
and it's identical to
all the work I showed you.

506
00:43:00.719 --> 00:43:01.809
Is there evidence?

507
00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.769
This sketchbook.

508
00:43:07.769 --> 00:43:09.559
Who's going to believe you
with only this much evidence?

509
00:43:10.679 --> 00:43:12.239
I can tell other people

510
00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.440
you plagiarized me.

511
00:43:14.639 --> 00:43:17.769
Because my collection's going to
be out for sale first anyway.

512
00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.559
You can take this to court
if you want.

513
00:43:22.119 --> 00:43:24.360
But I have to warn you
I have a good lawyer.

514
00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.960
The person I respected the most
betrayed me

515
00:43:48.239 --> 00:43:49.880
to the point that I felt lost,

516
00:43:50.159 --> 00:43:52.480
and I didn't want to live anymore.

517
00:43:54.679 --> 00:43:57.599
This is the real reason
for everything.

518
00:43:58.039 --> 00:43:59.880
The person who hurt me

519
00:44:01.159 --> 00:44:02.320
is Kan.

520
00:44:08.119 --> 00:44:09.119
Mom,

521
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:12.039
hang in there.

522
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.199
I'm going to transfer you
the money soon.

523
00:44:35.559 --> 00:44:37.840
What do you think
of Kritsana's collection?

524
00:44:38.159 --> 00:44:40.599
It's different from what you've seen
from other brands, right?

525
00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.440
If Kan really stole your idea,

526
00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.920
there must be proof.

527
00:44:46.039 --> 00:44:49.079
Sao, you have Rung's journal,
don't you?

528
00:44:49.079 --> 00:44:50.480
I went to see Kan.

529
00:44:50.639 --> 00:44:52.159
Why did you do that?

530
00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.199
Is there anything else you want
to say to me?

531
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.559
Do you remember what happened
three years ago

532
00:44:57.679 --> 00:44:59.719
and what you did to me?
