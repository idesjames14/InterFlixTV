1
00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.159
Rung.

2
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.810
Tan.

3
00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.639
Yes, Rung?

4
00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.199
The woman named Rarin.

5
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.960
Stay away from her.

6
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.759
She's the one who made me
lose the will to live.

7
00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.879
What do you mean?

8
00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:29.280
- Why is Rarin...
- She plagiarized my work.

9
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.370
Plagiarized?

10
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.240
But you and Rarin just met.

11
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.530
I remember

12
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.810
that the collection I was working on

13
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.960
was stolen by a brand called Rarin.

14
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.400
And everything was identical.

15
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.960
But

16
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.719
there's a chance that an idea
can coincidentally be the same.

17
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.960
Even my signature rainbow pattern

18
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.599
was identical.

19
00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.680
How is that possible

20
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.479
if she didn't plagiarize my work?

21
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.400
Rung,

22
00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.719
calm down.

23
00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:13.400
You have to believe me.

24
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.080
Believe me.

25
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.439
Okay, Rung. I believe you.

26
00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.639
But you have to rest now.

27
00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.159
You have to believe me.

28
00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:26.639
Tan.

29
00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:28.719
Tan.

30
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.000
Tan, it's time to get ready
for your scene.

31
00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.319
Okay.

32
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.520
I don't think
it's going to work between us.

33
00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:47.680
Do you understand?

34
00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:53.400
I understand.

35
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.560
Cut!

36
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.199
Everyone,

37
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.199
it's a wrap!

38
00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:17.480
Thank you.

39
00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.170
Thank you.

40
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.959
Why is it so difficult

41
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.480
for you to start a rumor
about a guy?

42
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.170
I did everything you asked.

43
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.399
But the news about Tanthai's
sister regaining consciousness

44
00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:51.439
buried all the news about me.

45
00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:53.730
So?

46
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.079
You can just go visit his sister
at the hospital.

47
00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.839
Simple.

48
00:04:59.839 --> 00:05:01.730
Or go and see her at home.

49
00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:03.399
Be friendly

50
00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:05.639
and seduce him.
It will blow up eventually.

51
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.439
But I've tried my best
in my own way.

52
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.439
And I don't want to cause
any trouble for Tanthai.

53
00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.839
Trouble?

54
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.920
You're the one who's going
to be in trouble.

55
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.170
Don't forget

56
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.639
that I'm holding on to
one of your secrets.

57
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.439
I don't care what you're
going to do to him.

58
00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:35.199
But it has to be
the talk of the town.

59
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.399
When it's time for us
to promote the movie,

60
00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:40.199
you have to do whatever you can

61
00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:42.879
to attract the most attention
from the press.

62
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.480
Do you understand?

63
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.360
I do.

64
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.279
I guarantee

65
00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:55.560
that it's going to be
the talk of the town.

66
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.759
You've always wondered, haven't you?

67
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.319
About your collection
that looks like Rung's?

68
00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:50.160
Do you think

69
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.399
that Tanthai's never seen
that sketchbook?

70
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.399
Are you okay, Rin?

71
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.240
I'm okay.

72
00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:03.120
I was being clumsy.

73
00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:05.319
We should clean up your wound.

74
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.759
It's a small wound. I'm fine.

75
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.439
Rin, Tanthai is here to see you.

76
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.560
Are you busy?

77
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.839
There's something
I need your help with.

78
00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:43.120
I understand how you feel.

79
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.240
It must be very uncomfortable.

80
00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.199
I'm sorry

81
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.360
for treating your outfit badly.

82
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.519
But it was one of the things that
my manager told me to do.

83
00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:03.800
I understand.

84
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.519
But

85
00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:10.920
are you sure you're
going to do this?

86
00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:14.399
Because it might affect your movie.

87
00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:21.759
I'm sure.

88
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:24.240
I've made my decision.

89
00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:34.120
If you're sure,

90
00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.120
then I'll do my best to help you.

91
00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.679
Da, the measuring tape, please.

92
00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.210
Here you are.

93
00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:53.799
I have to take your measurements.

94
00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:55.759
I'll start with...

95
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.450
Just a second, Prim.

96
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.600
I'll show you some examples.

97
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.480
Tan, what are you doing in here?

98
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.480
I saw you taking measurements.

99
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.279
So I didn't want to be in the way.

100
00:10:31.519 --> 00:10:35.039
You're clever to come up
with this plan.

101
00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:38.519
It wasn't my plan.

102
00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:41.759
It was Primrose who had the courage
to come and see you.

103
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.519
If we're going to make
this plan work,

104
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.919
we need someone's help.

105
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.159
As for you,

106
00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.440
have you thought of having a family?

107
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.840
Please.

108
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.960
What do you want? Why did you
send people to find me?

109
00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.360
I'm going to let you come back
and stay at home.

110
00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:32.799
I'll return you the condo,

111
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.159
the car,

112
00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:36.240
the credit card,

113
00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.799
and your position at the company.

114
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.159
Just be direct, Dad.

115
00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:54.919
Praew already told you.

116
00:11:56.159 --> 00:11:57.600
You have to get married.

117
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:01.960
Again.

118
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.879
This again.

119
00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:07.960
Why is it so important to you?
I don't understand!

120
00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:11.279
Porsch,

121
00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:15.639
you really want to ruin my family,
don't you?

122
00:12:16.879 --> 00:12:18.039
You can't see

123
00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:20.440
that this is
about business, can you?

124
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.960
How many times have I told you

125
00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:24.279
that true love

126
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.360
comes with a high price?

127
00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.679
No matter how much
you devote yourself,

128
00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:37.279
there's no way you're going
to get what you put in.

129
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.440
Are you okay, Dad?

130
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.679
Get his medication!

131
00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.240
No need.

132
00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.440
No need.

133
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.679
Wait in your room.

134
00:12:58.639 --> 00:13:00.679
And don't go anywhere
until I say so.

135
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.879
This way, please.

136
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.360
What's up, Rin?

137
00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.720
Porsch,

138
00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.919
I need your help.

139
00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.039
I've talked to Porsch.

140
00:13:39.679 --> 00:13:40.919
He's agreed to help.

141
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.879
And he said he'll handle everything.

142
00:13:44.879 --> 00:13:45.919
Okay.

143
00:13:46.679 --> 00:13:48.120
It's good if things
are falling into place.

144
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.799
By the way, how's Rung doing?

145
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.279
She's getting better.

146
00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:56.600
As good as she can be.

147
00:13:58.559 --> 00:14:01.679
She's starting to remember
some things.

148
00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:07.440
Does the nurse named Sao

149
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.240
still work for her?

150
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.200
Mmm.

151
00:14:11.879 --> 00:14:12.879
Why?

152
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.480
Well,

153
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.279
- Sao, she...
- Rin,

154
00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:23.679
Primrose wants to discuss
more details about the outfit.

155
00:14:24.519 --> 00:14:25.519
Okay.

156
00:14:29.559 --> 00:14:30.639
You should get back to work.

157
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:32.440
Okay.

158
00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.519
Here they are.

159
00:14:47.399 --> 00:14:48.399
Here.

160
00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:51.960
These are magazines

161
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:54.759
that featured Tan.

162
00:14:54.919 --> 00:14:57.559
As for the rest, you have to
look it up online.

163
00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:00.519
- Thank you very much.
- Mmm.

164
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.279
You're starting to be able to move
and do things on your own.

165
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.840
You'll have to practice
walking next.

166
00:15:10.279 --> 00:15:12.840
Mmm. I'll try.

167
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.720
Rung,

168
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.320
do you still remember about us?

169
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.600
I never

170
00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:33.200
forgot about you.

171
00:15:37.919 --> 00:15:40.960
By the way,

172
00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:44.720
I can't believe that it's Tan
when I read the interview.

173
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.799
- His thoughts have matured.
- Hmpf.

174
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.360
I don't think so.

175
00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:53.919
He's still very childish about
certain things. What a headache.

176
00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:57.519
He's got a nickname in the business.

177
00:15:57.519 --> 00:15:58.960
It's "scarecrow."

178
00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.279
They say he's really
difficult to handle.

179
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.879
He stirs up a scandal every day.

180
00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.159
My head is about to explode.

181
00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:07.879
He's that bad?

182
00:16:07.879 --> 00:16:09.960
Mmm. That bad.

183
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.720
But lately, he's improved

184
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.480
since he signed up to be
the muse for Rarin's brand.

185
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.480
Tan's probably

186
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:22.240
trying to be the prince
like the brand wants him to be.

187
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.159
I have to thank Rarin

188
00:16:27.039 --> 00:16:28.759
for helping Tan.

189
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.679
That's just the way it is.

190
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.480
It's the power of love.

191
00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.840
You're not going to live long
drinking like that.

192
00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.200
I told you to stay in your room.

193
00:17:09.519 --> 00:17:12.359
You were very mischievous
when you were younger.

194
00:17:15.039 --> 00:17:16.519
I still remember

195
00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.920
the day you pretended
to run away from home.

196
00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.279
Your mom was so worried.

197
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.279
She summoned hundreds
of people to look for you.

198
00:17:29.519 --> 00:17:30.599
In the end,

199
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.559
you told everyone

200
00:17:34.599 --> 00:17:36.759
that you were hiding in the closet
for the whole day.

201
00:17:38.319 --> 00:17:39.960
I've caused so much trouble.

202
00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:41.799
And you remember everything?

203
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.759
I do

204
00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.599
if it's about you.

205
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:05.960
I miss Mom.

206
00:18:11.839 --> 00:18:13.799
Our family was able
to become wealthy

207
00:18:15.839 --> 00:18:17.680
because of our
international business.

208
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.200
It was for your mom,

209
00:18:21.319 --> 00:18:22.680
your sister,

210
00:18:23.039 --> 00:18:24.039
and you.

211
00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:25.839
So that all of you can live happily.

212
00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.240
There's never been a day
that I didn't work.

213
00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.559
Sometimes

214
00:18:31.599 --> 00:18:33.599
I had to force myself
to do something

215
00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:36.079
so that it would be a success.

216
00:18:42.410 --> 00:18:44.240
Love is unconditional.

217
00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.839
There's no profit.

218
00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.200
Just like the love

219
00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:55.440
I have for our family.

220
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.759
This marriage

221
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:09.170
is related to the future
of our family's business.

222
00:19:11.319 --> 00:19:12.799
You said you were going
to return me everything.

223
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.000
Were you being truthful?

224
00:19:27.359 --> 00:19:28.359
Whoa.

225
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.519
It's so beautiful.

226
00:19:31.319 --> 00:19:32.319
Right?

227
00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.759
I got the inspiration from the day
we went on a stroll after the rain.

228
00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.079
So the theme is
the sky after the rain.

229
00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.720
The top part of the outfit

230
00:19:41.839 --> 00:19:43.680
looks masculine.

231
00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.319
So I revealed one of the shoulders.

232
00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.319
As for the bottom,

233
00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.410
it's a skirt

234
00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:52.720
and it's my signature.

235
00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:54.240
The rainbow.

236
00:19:58.839 --> 00:20:00.839
A bare-shouldered masculine top

237
00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:03.039
and a rainbow skirt.

238
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.799
I don't really understand.

239
00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:07.680
Oh, you.

240
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.720
Rung!

241
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.720
Rung!

242
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.960
Rung!

243
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.000
Thank you very much, Tan.

244
00:20:38.359 --> 00:20:40.680
Rung's idea is really great.

245
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.680
Tan,

246
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.839
please have some breakfast.

247
00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.440
I prepared it for you.

248
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.410
Where's Mind?

249
00:21:16.559 --> 00:21:18.079
She went out to buy something.

250
00:21:19.039 --> 00:21:20.799
Sao's been here since morning.

251
00:21:21.079 --> 00:21:22.680
She volunteered to cook

252
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.890
so you could eat
once you came downstairs.

253
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.410
Thank you.

254
00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:29.200
You didn't have to.

255
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.359
It's fine.

256
00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:31.960
I wanted to cook for you anyway.

257
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.319
I'll feed her myself today.

258
00:21:37.799 --> 00:21:40.480
Well, then. I'll excuse myself.

259
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.160
How is it going

260
00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.920
between you

261
00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.920
and that woman?

262
00:22:10.039 --> 00:22:11.079
I don't really know.

263
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.799
I haven't talked to her much.

264
00:22:17.319 --> 00:22:20.920
But there definitely are a lot
of things that look similar.

265
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.279
So that means you don't believe me.

266
00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:27.839
If someday

267
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.839
you had to choose
between me and Rarin,

268
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.319
who are you going to choose?

269
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.839
I'd probably couldn't choose.

270
00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.480
Rung,

271
00:22:49.079 --> 00:22:51.000
there's one thing
I have to tell you.

272
00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.359
It's about me

273
00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.440
and Rarin.

274
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.240
You don't have to believe me

275
00:23:03.559 --> 00:23:07.400
because it's quite unbelievable.

276
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.400
Are you telling me

277
00:23:11.799 --> 00:23:15.079
that Rarin got her ideas from me

278
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.240
because

279
00:23:20.079 --> 00:23:23.720
you can talk to each other
through the rain?

280
00:23:27.119 --> 00:23:28.119
That's right.

281
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.880
I don't know how to feel.

282
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:36.039
Rung, I'm not trying
to make excuses.

283
00:23:36.519 --> 00:23:38.640
- Because it's partially my fault.
- Leave.

284
00:23:40.359 --> 00:23:41.559
But Rung...

285
00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:43.319
I want to think about
something alone.

286
00:23:44.359 --> 00:23:46.359
- Rung...
- Can you leave me alone for now?

287
00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.400
I want to ask you about Sao.

288
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.559
Sao?

289
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.720
You could've just called me.
We didn't have to meet out here.

290
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.559
It's okay.

291
00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:31.720
I wanted to see you
in person anyway.

292
00:24:33.319 --> 00:24:35.279
So about the nurse named Sao,

293
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:38.759
when did she start
taking care of Rung?

294
00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.440
Around two years ago.

295
00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.960
She specializes in
bedridden patients.

296
00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.160
There's never been a problem.
So we hired her long term.

297
00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.680
Is there anything going on?
Why are you asking?

298
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.000
Well, I want you to keep
an eye on her.

299
00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:59.440
I don't really trust her.

300
00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.720
Are you overthinking it?

301
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.359
- Sao is...
- I'm being serious.

302
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.000
I'm sorry, Tan.

303
00:25:37.319 --> 00:25:38.359
I'm sorry.

304
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.960
Tan, I brought you coffee.

305
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.000
I wanted to apologize for
what happened just now.

306
00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.680
What are you thinking about?

307
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.480
I want to be able to hear it too.

308
00:27:03.359 --> 00:27:04.440
Tan?

309
00:27:06.599 --> 00:27:08.079
Tan, can you hear me?

310
00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.960
I just want to talk to you.

311
00:27:30.759 --> 00:27:32.720
Awesome!

312
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:33.759
You're funny.

313
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.079
I'll be right back.

314
00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.960
Rin, I've taken care of
what you asked.

315
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.480
Thank you very much, Porsch.

316
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.559
So you've made up with your family?

317
00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:58.400
Mmm. It's okay now.

318
00:27:58.519 --> 00:28:00.880
I'm sorry it's sudden. I haven't
even given you an explanation.

319
00:28:01.079 --> 00:28:02.079
Mmm.

320
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:03.759
It's good that you're home.

321
00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.519
Now, behave so that
you don't get kicked out again.

322
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.319
Why? I want to stay with you.

323
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.359
Greetings, everyone. I'm Thierry.

324
00:28:12.359 --> 00:28:15.720
I'm going to be your host tonight.

325
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.440
First of all,
let's give a round of applause

326
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.640
to the cast and crew of "The Basic",

327
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.359
who were able to finish
filming on time.

328
00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:28.799
It has started. Don't you have
to make a speech up there?

329
00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:30.599
Let's see how romantic...

330
00:28:30.599 --> 00:28:32.079
- A little.
- Tanthai and Primrose are.

331
00:28:32.079 --> 00:28:33.079
Come on.

332
00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.960
Tan,

333
00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:43.480
have you been feeling okay lately?

334
00:28:43.799 --> 00:28:45.880
How come I haven't been able
to get a hold of you?

335
00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:48.279
It's nothing.

336
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.079
I've been busy taking care of Rung.

337
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.279
There are a lot of reporters
here today.

338
00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:21.079
See, Prim?

339
00:29:22.079 --> 00:29:24.200
You can do it if you want to.

340
00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.079
It wasn't me who was able
to attract this much attention.

341
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:32.920
Anyway,

342
00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:34.799
it's good enough.

343
00:29:46.319 --> 00:29:48.119
I'll see you tonight
after the event.

344
00:30:04.319 --> 00:30:05.880
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

345
00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.880
You look so handsome.
I'm going to get a drink.

346
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.880
Okay.

347
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.279
- Hello, Aek.
- Hello.

348
00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:12.680
- Can I get an interview with you?
- Hello. Of course.

349
00:30:13.079 --> 00:30:15.359
Do you think you're going
to reach 100 million?

350
00:30:15.359 --> 00:30:16.359
100 million?

351
00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:18.720
I never really thought about it.

352
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.200
But it would great if we did.

353
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:22.720
How does it feel working
with the two lead actors?

354
00:30:23.079 --> 00:30:24.839
It's good.

355
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.559
They've improved,
and they tried hard

356
00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:30.440
- to do their best.
- It wouldn't have been successful

357
00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.559
if it wasn't
for this important person.

358
00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:34.640
Please welcome
the executive producer,

359
00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.960
Porsch,
Mr. Patchara Kriangkraisakun,

360
00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.279
the CEO of UF Group Co., Ltd.

361
00:30:39.279 --> 00:30:40.799
Please give him a hand.

362
00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.519
Thank you.

363
00:30:50.519 --> 00:30:52.160
Hello, everyone.

364
00:30:52.359 --> 00:30:55.079
Thank you everyone
for joining us tonight.

365
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.119
I have to thank all of
the cast and crew.

366
00:30:59.119 --> 00:31:02.880
But there's one person who deserves
a special thank you.

367
00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.279
Apart from her beauty and talent,

368
00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:11.279
I believe she can be an inspiration
to many others.

369
00:31:12.039 --> 00:31:14.319
I'd like you to give
a round of applause

370
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.559
to Primrose.

371
00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:30.119
Hello, everyone.

372
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:36.039
There are many people
I'd like to thank tonight.

373
00:31:37.119 --> 00:31:40.200
I'll begin with the cast and crew

374
00:31:40.559 --> 00:31:43.480
for sticking together
for months on end.

375
00:31:44.559 --> 00:31:46.480
Thank you, Tanthai.

376
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.559
Apart from being the hero on screen,

377
00:31:49.839 --> 00:31:54.079
he was also the hero in real life
who has given me strength.

378
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.960
Thank you, Rarin,

379
00:31:58.319 --> 00:32:01.079
for my beautiful outfit tonight.

380
00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:04.599
Do you think it's beautiful?

381
00:32:04.599 --> 00:32:06.799
- It is!
- It is!

382
00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.960
Of course.

383
00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.559
Every woman

384
00:32:13.279 --> 00:32:15.440
wants to be beautiful,

385
00:32:16.359 --> 00:32:18.279
to be complimented,

386
00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:21.400
and to be loved

387
00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.480
like this rose.

388
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.759
No matter how many
sharp thorns it has,

389
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:47.680
there are people
who want to pluck them out.

390
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.319
This rose

391
00:32:50.799 --> 00:32:52.559
is like myself.

392
00:32:53.079 --> 00:32:55.559
It got plucked at repeatedly

393
00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.200
to the point it was bruised

394
00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:00.480
by a filthy man.

395
00:33:00.759 --> 00:33:01.839
Who is it?

396
00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.920
You think

397
00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.799
there are a lot of scars

398
00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.799
on my outfit, don't you?

399
00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.680
Countless scars, right?

400
00:33:16.759 --> 00:33:20.559
Even though I can't fix the past,

401
00:33:21.759 --> 00:33:24.359
I'm going to live my own life
from now on.

402
00:33:28.599 --> 00:33:30.319
Thank you very much, Aek.

403
00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.119
Aek?

404
00:33:34.359 --> 00:33:37.000
As the director,
you've taught me many things,

405
00:33:38.319 --> 00:33:40.319
including telling me

406
00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.240
how my life is worth
more than I thought.

407
00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.839
Whoa!

408
00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.279
Why is he doing that?

409
00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.400
It's Aek!

410
00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.920
What is going on?

411
00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:59.119
I'll see you tonight
after the event.

412
00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.279
What's the truth?

413
00:34:01.279 --> 00:34:03.720
You're a famous director.
Why did you do that?

414
00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.039
- Please give us an answer.
- Please answer.

415
00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:08.119
Is there something we don't know?

416
00:34:08.119 --> 00:34:10.400
- Why did you do that?
- Please answer.

417
00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.880
Please don't go yet.

418
00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:15.079
How could you do that? Is it true?

419
00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.360
Aek!

420
00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:30.719
Thank you, everyone.

421
00:34:31.559 --> 00:34:33.639
There's no need to thank us.

422
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.400
I didn't do much.

423
00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.239
You're the one who
deserves the credit.

424
00:34:38.119 --> 00:34:41.400
I have a lot of respect for you.

425
00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.159
What are you going
to do tomorrow, Prim?

426
00:34:44.559 --> 00:34:46.159
The reporters are going to
be all over you.

427
00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:54.440
I've prepared myself mentally.

428
00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.039
Keep fighting.

429
00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.920
I have to excuse myself now.

430
00:35:39.639 --> 00:35:40.920
I'll give you a lift.

431
00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.329
Thanks for driving me home.

432
00:36:16.719 --> 00:36:18.039
It's nothing.

433
00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.000
You've helped me a lot.
I actually have to thank you.

434
00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.519
That's true.

435
00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.719
You're going to be the heir
to the throne again.

436
00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.559
You probably won't need me anymore.

437
00:36:27.769 --> 00:36:29.769
It's me who has to rely on you.

438
00:36:38.239 --> 00:36:39.239
Mind,

439
00:36:41.079 --> 00:36:43.289
I have to keep my promise to Dad.

440
00:36:45.639 --> 00:36:47.079
I have to get married.

441
00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:55.880
Geez,

442
00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:58.840
when you pestered Rarin
with proposals,

443
00:36:59.329 --> 00:37:00.809
you didn't even have to
get married back then.

444
00:37:00.809 --> 00:37:02.679
Now it's so soon.

445
00:37:12.559 --> 00:37:15.199
I wish you a happy family life.

446
00:37:28.679 --> 00:37:30.809
Hurry back home. It's about to rain.

447
00:38:16.039 --> 00:38:18.559
Oh, why did you pull over here?

448
00:38:19.289 --> 00:38:20.840
Are you going home tonight?

449
00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.809
I probably won't
go upstairs with you.

450
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.440
Tan,

451
00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.329
is something wrong?

452
00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.440
Rin,

453
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.480
I know about everything now.

454
00:38:41.079 --> 00:38:42.559
About you

455
00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.920
and Rung.

456
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:13.199
You got the inspiration
for the outfit from Rung.

457
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:14.960
No.

458
00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.239
From me?

459
00:39:17.239 --> 00:39:18.360
It's not true.

460
00:39:19.599 --> 00:39:22.119
I didn't mean to.

461
00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.480
I know.

462
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.809
It's because of the power.

463
00:39:27.289 --> 00:39:29.360
But that makes me
hate myself even more.

464
00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.719
No, Tan.

465
00:39:31.719 --> 00:39:33.960
I didn't want it
to turn out this way.

466
00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.880
You should go up to your condo.

467
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.639
I'll get you an umbrella.

468
00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.159
I just don't want to talk
to you right now.

469
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:51.920
Tan!

470
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.440
Tan!

471
00:39:55.329 --> 00:39:56.920
Tan, I'm sorry!

472
00:39:57.039 --> 00:39:59.559
I didn't know it was Rung's idea!

473
00:40:08.519 --> 00:40:09.840
It's my fault

474
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.960
for relying on your voice!

475
00:40:13.159 --> 00:40:16.329
I didn't know this would happen!

476
00:40:18.809 --> 00:40:20.639
- You should go now!
- Tan!

477
00:40:28.519 --> 00:40:29.809
- Tan.
- It's funny

478
00:40:30.559 --> 00:40:32.400
we can hear each other's voices.

479
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.519
But you were able to lie to me
for so long.

480
00:40:36.679 --> 00:40:38.360
- I hate...
- I love you.

481
00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.159
I hate everything

482
00:40:46.809 --> 00:40:48.119
that's caused this to happen!

483
00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:50.000
But I can't hate you!

484
00:40:50.289 --> 00:40:52.769
If I could do it,
things would be easier!

485
00:40:53.769 --> 00:40:54.920
Do you want to know

486
00:40:56.559 --> 00:40:58.039
why I hated this voice

487
00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.769
when we first met?

488
00:41:22.329 --> 00:41:23.639
Prince?

489
00:41:26.119 --> 00:41:29.880
I told you to stop calling me that.

490
00:41:32.199 --> 00:41:33.880
Do you have some time?

491
00:41:35.199 --> 00:41:36.920
I'd like you to hear my idea.

492
00:41:38.719 --> 00:41:39.719
Alright.

493
00:41:40.199 --> 00:41:41.880
But only for a little bit.

494
00:41:43.639 --> 00:41:44.639
Mmm!

495
00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.000
I'm going to start now.

496
00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.840
My concept

497
00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.809
is climate change.

498
00:42:04.119 --> 00:42:08.159
I'm going to express it through...

499
00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:38.199
(Rung 12 missed calls)

500
00:42:45.119 --> 00:42:46.119
Rung?

501
00:42:48.329 --> 00:42:49.769
Rung, what are you doing?

502
00:42:50.769 --> 00:42:52.880
Wake up! Rung!

503
00:42:57.079 --> 00:42:58.079
Rung!

504
00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.239
Rung, wake up!

505
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Rung!

506
00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.079
Rung!

507
00:43:19.519 --> 00:43:22.599
That day when Rung
decided to end her life

508
00:43:23.519 --> 00:43:25.119
while I was away

509
00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:28.679
was because of that stupid power!

510
00:43:30.719 --> 00:43:31.809
Do you know

511
00:43:32.199 --> 00:43:34.360
I almost liked that stupid voice?

512
00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.289
If that day Rung hadn't...

513
00:43:43.599 --> 00:43:45.360
I really hate it!

514
00:43:46.039 --> 00:43:47.880
I hate it! I hate it! I hate it!

515
00:43:50.039 --> 00:43:52.199
I don't want to hear
your voice anymore!

516
00:44:26.599 --> 00:44:27.960
Love me.

517
00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:29.639
Be obsessed with me.

518
00:44:30.199 --> 00:44:32.400
- Love me.
- I trusted you.

519
00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.800
And what are you doing in my house?

520
00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:35.440
If you're going to love Tan,

521
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.960
I want you to love him sincerely.

522
00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:40.880
I'm about to marry the woman
my dad chose for me.

523
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.360
Sao is a stalker.

524
00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.920
This is huge.

525
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.559
It might be safer
if you stay with Rin.

526
00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.960
How come you're here?
