1
00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:02.319
Oh, you're up?

2
00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.439
Hey!

3
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.480
You again?

4
00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.199
Did you do anything
to me last night?

5
00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.960
Don't you remember anything?

6
00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.599
We...

7
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.639
We're here.

8
00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.319
I'm going now.

9
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.120
Where are you going?

10
00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:52.199
Didn't your dad
confiscate all of your things?

11
00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.159
One of my friends lives in the area.

12
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.719
I can stay with him. No problem.

13
00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.199
You can come inside for a drink
if you'd like.

14
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.520
Mind?

15
00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.960
You have a guest.

16
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.520
Shouldn't you be serving
tea or coffee?

17
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.520
And what's this?

18
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.199
Tea or coffee at 9 p.m.?

19
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.280
- Beer is better.
- But...

20
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.560
Or not?

21
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.120
Try me.

22
00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:19.050
You drank yourself
into a stupor last night

23
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.170
and threw up all over your shirt.

24
00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.519
So I had to take your clothes off
and dragged you here.

25
00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.610
We didn't

26
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.399
sleep together, right?

27
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.170
Not last night, no.

28
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.759
But I'm not sure about other times.

29
00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:34.959
Shut up!

30
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.920
Do you want your clothes back?

31
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.519
Of course!

32
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.120
Here.

33
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.319
Hurry up and get dressed.
I'll make you breakfast.

34
00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:46.439
You can get out now.

35
00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.319
What are you looking at?

36
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.170
You're sexually harassing me.

37
00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.639
Why is she so thirsty?

38
00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.199
Here's your breakfast.

39
00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:27.279
What is this?

40
00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.439
Instant noodles.
Haven't you heard of them?

41
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.199
No American breakfast

42
00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:37.839
or a buffet?

43
00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.040
- A buffet?
- Right.

44
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.079
- You don't have to eat then.
- Hold on!

45
00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:45.040
I was only joking.
Why are you sulking?

46
00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:48.319
Here. Eat up.

47
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.480
Why didn't you tell me it's hot?

48
00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:07.839
- My mouth is burning!
- Take it slow!

49
00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:09.800
Turn around.
There's something on your face.

50
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.079
Tasty, isn't it?

51
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.199
So-so.

52
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.680
So-so? I did my best.
Just say so if it's tasty.

53
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.240
It's just instant noodles.

54
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.079
Just? It's not "just!".

55
00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:34.399
If we put our feelings into cooking,

56
00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:35.839
the food will be tastier.

57
00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:39.319
- Can't you feel it?
- Feel what?

58
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.720
Feel the love.

59
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.720
Mmm.

60
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.560
Hey!

61
00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:04.079
What are you doing here?

62
00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:07.759
Tan! Tan! Tan!

63
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.920
The thing is,

64
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.319
Porsche got kicked out of the house.

65
00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.600
So I let him stay here.

66
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.839
His dad confiscated his car
and credit cards.

67
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.759
Oh?

68
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.079
Have you fallen from grace?

69
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.560
Tan!

70
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.879
You're kicking me while I'm down?

71
00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:25.920
Huh? You're kicking me
while I'm down?

72
00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.560
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.

73
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.160
There's no need to talk.
I don't have to stay at your house.

74
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.959
Get out then! Who told you to stay?

75
00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:33.920
Tan, calm down!
Can you let me explain?

76
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.720
No need. Your house is filthy.

77
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.040
I don't have to stay here.
I can leave now.

78
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.439
- Porsch!
- Yes?

79
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.199
- I don't have to stay...
- Go upstairs!

80
00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:43.199
Yes, ma'am.

81
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.120
Mind,

82
00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:49.040
this is my house.

83
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.600
Tan,

84
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.439
let her explain first.

85
00:07:53.959 --> 00:07:55.600
Porsch is really in trouble.

86
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.920
Can't he stay for a few days?

87
00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.759
Did you make a decision
on your own again?

88
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.920
That's my shirt
and this is my house!

89
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.040
What do you want me to do? Let him
walk around the house naked?

90
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.040
That's right.
Tell him to get out now.

91
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.959
Can you just calm down for a sec?

92
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.120
Water.

93
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.120
Can I have some water?

94
00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:31.199
Can I have some water?

95
00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:34.759
Okay, okay.

96
00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.759
I'm going to behave. Happy?

97
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.559
Not just behave.

98
00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:42.120
You should also be friends.

99
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.919
My head is going to rupture if you
and him keep fighting every day.

100
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:50.759
Mind, who's the woman upstairs?

101
00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:56.360
It's my business.

102
00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.759
Stay out of it.

103
00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.330
I was just asking.
Why do you have to be angry?

104
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.159
- She said she's thirsty.
- She's none of your business.

105
00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:07.799
Show me some respect
if you want to stay.

106
00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:10.759
Besides, stay out of that room...

107
00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:15.279
What did you say just now?

108
00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.879
Porsch, what did you say?

109
00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:26.679
I said I was just asking.
Why do you have to be angry?

110
00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:27.720
No.

111
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:29.519
After that.

112
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.639
The woman upstairs is thirsty.

113
00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:38.399
Hey!

114
00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:40.879
What's going on?

115
00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:45.919
I'm coming with!

116
00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.120
I've examined her.

117
00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:35.320
She's exhausted

118
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.960
and she has myasthenia.

119
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.639
Let her rest a lot

120
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.399
and receive physical therapy.

121
00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:43.480
She's going to get better soon.

122
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.639
Other than that,

123
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.879
there's nothing to worry about.

124
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.240
She doesn't seem to
remember anything.

125
00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:53.840
It's normal.

126
00:11:54.399 --> 00:11:56.679
For bedridden patients,

127
00:11:57.159 --> 00:11:59.200
their muscles haven't been
used in a while,

128
00:11:59.519 --> 00:12:00.879
including their brain.

129
00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:03.840
Her memory will return soon.

130
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.919
But I'm not sure

131
00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.200
if she's going to
remember everything.

132
00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.080
I'm going to make an appointment

133
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.679
for her to be examined again.

134
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.919
- Please come this way.
- Okay.

135
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.519
How are you feeling, Rung?

136
00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:43.399
Oh,

137
00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:45.399
this is Rarin,

138
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.080
my girlfriend.

139
00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:55.480
You have a girlfriend?

140
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.960
You can call me Rin.

141
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.440
It's a pleasure to meet you.

142
00:13:05.399 --> 00:13:07.440
Tan must've caused you
a lot of headaches.

143
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.919
I didn't

144
00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:14.799
Are you okay?

145
00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:21.320
Let's let her rest.

146
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.919
We have to get back to work as well.

147
00:13:24.039 --> 00:13:25.039
Okay.

148
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.600
I won't bother you now.

149
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.480
I hope you get better soon.

150
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.240
Rin.

151
00:13:42.799 --> 00:13:44.000
I'll call you.

152
00:13:58.919 --> 00:14:00.480
Hello?

153
00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:04.919
I have to cancel
Tanthai's work for now.

154
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.639
There's a bit of a personal issue.

155
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.600
It's a family matter.

156
00:14:13.159 --> 00:14:15.679
Okay. I'm sorry.

157
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.000
Thank you very much. Goodbye.

158
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.000
Oh, Rin.

159
00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.399
Are you going now?

160
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.399
Mmm.

161
00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.960
I was thinking of talking to you

162
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.120
about Tanthai's fitting for BFW.

163
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.200
But

164
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.759
let's leave it for now.

165
00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:38.960
Mmm.

166
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.879
I want Tan to stay
with Rung for now.

167
00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.480
The reporters are going to have
a field day if they find out.

168
00:14:45.679 --> 00:14:46.840
I understand.

169
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.440
Speak of the devil.

170
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.960
Hello?

171
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.559
That's right.

172
00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.279
Tan's not really available
at this moment.

173
00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.240
Hmm.

174
00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:05.279
Can we leave it for another time?

175
00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:09.039
I'll contact you immediately
once Tan's available again.

176
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.720
Bangkok Fashion Week

177
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.360
is organized under the concept
"somewhere in Bangkok."

178
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.399
You've all been informed.

179
00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:21.279
In August, I hope to

180
00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:23.240
receive collaboration

181
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:27.320
and creativity from each of
your brands like in previous years.

182
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.440
But this year is
more special than others.

183
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.799
Because we have Anya,

184
00:15:31.799 --> 00:15:33.320
the legendary columnist,

185
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.960
as our consultant.

186
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.120
You're like our salvation.

187
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.799
You're flattering me.

188
00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:43.600
For the rough schedule, there will
be a press conference on the 25th

189
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.759
and a blocking rehearsal on the 8th
before the event like usual.

190
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.360
I'd like the organizing team to stay
back and further discuss things.

191
00:15:50.279 --> 00:15:52.600
That's all for the designers.

192
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.799
Would you like to
add anything, Anya?

193
00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.600
I don't think so.

194
00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.399
I hope everyone will do their best,

195
00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:02.600
create new things,

196
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.200
and preserve the honor
of being a designer.

197
00:16:14.759 --> 00:16:15.759
Rarin.

198
00:16:25.919 --> 00:16:27.399
- Rarin.
- Yes?

199
00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.600
Anya called you.

200
00:16:32.559 --> 00:16:34.120
It's nothing, really.

201
00:16:34.559 --> 00:16:37.679
I just saw that you weren't paying
attention during our meeting.

202
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.679
I hope

203
00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:42.240
that you'll have something
to surprise us with.

204
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.320
Of course.

205
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.320
It's my first time
collaborating with you.

206
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.039
I'll do my best.

207
00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:57.360
I won't disappoint you or
anyone else here.

208
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.119
Your stomach is still weak.

209
00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:22.799
The doctor recommended something
that's easy to digest.

210
00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:25.240
Once you've fully recovered,

211
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:29.200
I'm going to take you
to all your favorite places.

212
00:17:33.599 --> 00:17:35.170
I'm sorry, Tan.

213
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.559
What for?

214
00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.319
You waking up

215
00:17:44.759 --> 00:17:47.039
is already the best thing that's
ever happened in my life.

216
00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:52.960
A lot must've happened

217
00:17:53.279 --> 00:17:55.279
while I was asleep.

218
00:17:57.279 --> 00:17:58.279
That's right.

219
00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:01.119
If you want to know about something,

220
00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:03.680
I'll tell you.

221
00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.240
Can you tell me
about your girlfriend then?

222
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.559
About Rin?

223
00:18:18.119 --> 00:18:19.650
She's

224
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.410
a lovely person.

225
00:18:24.319 --> 00:18:25.839
And she's very talented.

226
00:18:27.119 --> 00:18:28.119
Oh,

227
00:18:28.599 --> 00:18:29.960
she's also a designer.

228
00:18:31.079 --> 00:18:32.839
I'm the muse for her brand.

229
00:18:35.559 --> 00:18:36.839
A designer?

230
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.960
Yes.

231
00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.480
When I'm with her,

232
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.559
I'm always reminded of you.

233
00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.759
If you want to see her,

234
00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:03.079
should I arrange a meeting?

235
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.720
Rin.

236
00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:34.960
- Yes?
- Uhh...

237
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.240
Are the patterns
for the finale done yet?

238
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.119
Well,

239
00:19:40.359 --> 00:19:42.480
I'm not rushing you or anything.

240
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:46.960
Not yet.

241
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.960
I'd like a bit more time.

242
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.960
I'm just worried about you.

243
00:19:57.039 --> 00:19:58.519
I'm sorry.

244
00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:25.319
Hello, is something the matter?

245
00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.410
Can't I call you otherwise?

246
00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.279
No, it's not like that.

247
00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:35.559
Are you okay?
You don't sound alright.

248
00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.240
Hmm.

249
00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:41.359
It's just work.

250
00:20:42.119 --> 00:20:44.039
I'm having a bit
of an artist's block.

251
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.240
Oh.

252
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.319
Do you want to talk to Rung?

253
00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:52.440
A designer talking to a designer.

254
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.650
You might get inspired.

255
00:20:55.599 --> 00:20:57.079
I don't want to be a bother.

256
00:20:58.079 --> 00:20:59.079
But I think

257
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.759
if you talk to her,

258
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.440
you might be able to help
jog her memory.

259
00:21:13.119 --> 00:21:14.960
But it's okay
if it's inconvenient for you.

260
00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.170
I'll come over then.

261
00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:22.279
Really?

262
00:21:23.359 --> 00:21:24.359
Mmm.

263
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.720
I have to hang up now.
I have a meeting.

264
00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:32.480
Okay. I'll see you later.

265
00:21:54.079 --> 00:21:55.359
Come on.

266
00:21:56.319 --> 00:21:57.519
Careful.

267
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.880
Careful.

268
00:22:06.759 --> 00:22:08.039
There.

269
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.359
Adjust her legs.

270
00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:22.599
What's that smell?

271
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.960
- It smells like...
- Something burning.

272
00:22:28.119 --> 00:22:29.400
Is there anyone else at home?

273
00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.799
Who else apart from Porsch?

274
00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.240
- Shoot!
- Shoot!

275
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.680
Hey!

276
00:22:38.359 --> 00:22:39.559
Let's take it slow, Rung.

277
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.680
You're home?

278
00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.279
- What are you doing?
- Welcoming food. Good, isn't it?

279
00:22:54.279 --> 00:22:56.640
Are you trying to burn
my kitchen down?

280
00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.000
Who can eat this garbage?

281
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.119
Hey, I'm being generous and helpful.

282
00:23:02.119 --> 00:23:03.640
When are you going to stop
being such a pain?

283
00:23:04.519 --> 00:23:06.279
Okay, now you're asking for it.

284
00:23:06.279 --> 00:23:07.279
Porsch!

285
00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:09.079
What are you doing?

286
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.759
The smoke's getting
into Rung's room.

287
00:23:11.519 --> 00:23:14.359
I'm cooking.
I made food for everyone.

288
00:23:14.519 --> 00:23:15.960
Shoot!

289
00:23:22.599 --> 00:23:23.599
Meow.

290
00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:36.079
If you try to burn
my house down again,

291
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.920
I'm going to kick you out.

292
00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:40.039
You're heartless.

293
00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:42.240
I put my feelings into my cooking.

294
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.839
I really did give it my best,
you know?

295
00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:48.319
What feelings?

296
00:23:49.119 --> 00:23:50.680
Mind told me if you put in...

297
00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.680
your feelings,
the food will be tasty.

298
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:03.519
Tan, I got rid of the smoke
in Rung's room.

299
00:24:03.839 --> 00:24:04.880
I'm going out.

300
00:24:05.319 --> 00:24:06.319
Mmm.

301
00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:09.200
- Where are you going?
- You're coming with me.

302
00:24:09.799 --> 00:24:10.960
Why do I have to?

303
00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.960
I don't want a fight to break out
while I'm away.

304
00:24:13.319 --> 00:24:14.319
Come on.

305
00:24:16.799 --> 00:24:18.200
- Hey!
- Keep walking.

306
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.519
Agh!

307
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:22.119
I hope you're gone for good.

308
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.160
Hello?

309
00:24:35.279 --> 00:24:36.279
Come on over.

310
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.720
Okay. See you.

311
00:25:09.119 --> 00:25:11.680
Rung, Rarin's here.

312
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.759
Hello.

313
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.920
Are you sure
that you don't want to rest?

314
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.160
I've rested enough. You know that.

315
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.440
You can sit down and talk to her.

316
00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:43.519
Mmm.

317
00:25:45.079 --> 00:25:46.680
I'll bring you some water.

318
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:04.400
Am I bothering you?

319
00:26:06.799 --> 00:26:07.920
Not at all.

320
00:26:09.319 --> 00:26:12.960
I heard you have your own brand?

321
00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.240
That's right.

322
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.480
But I'm trying to do a rebrand
at the moment.

323
00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:24.400
Bangkok Fashion Week is next month.

324
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Mmm.

325
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.839
You're quite talented.

326
00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.440
How come a talented person
became my brother's girlfriend?

327
00:26:34.119 --> 00:26:35.440
Actually,

328
00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.720
it's my first time
collaborating with them.

329
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.480
And

330
00:26:42.359 --> 00:26:44.799
I still can't come up
with an outfit for the finale.

331
00:26:45.519 --> 00:26:47.519
What are you going to do then?

332
00:26:48.079 --> 00:26:49.160
Hmm.

333
00:26:49.839 --> 00:26:52.359
I don't really know.

334
00:26:52.839 --> 00:26:56.039
Sometimes I look at references

335
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.680
or

336
00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.960
I sleep for the whole day.

337
00:27:06.599 --> 00:27:09.400
Or sometimes I just wait
for the rain.

338
00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.480
Rain?

339
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.200
Uhh...

340
00:27:23.759 --> 00:27:25.039
I mean that

341
00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.279
I look at the weather.

342
00:27:31.599 --> 00:27:33.039
I'll bring over some fruit.

343
00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.720
You're a designer as well?

344
00:27:50.279 --> 00:27:51.279
Mmm.

345
00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:55.759
But I don't really remember

346
00:27:55.759 --> 00:27:57.599
what kind of designer I was.

347
00:28:01.079 --> 00:28:04.960
Hasn't your memory returned?

348
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.839
I can vaguely remember.

349
00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.440
I remember before I went to sleep,

350
00:28:17.599 --> 00:28:19.480
I was designing an outfit.

351
00:28:22.079 --> 00:28:24.559
But I can't remember what style.

352
00:28:31.119 --> 00:28:33.519
But you're talented.
You'll come up with something.

353
00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:35.559
Huh.

354
00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.519
Not really.

355
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.759
But I work hard

356
00:28:42.519 --> 00:28:45.839
because there are a lot of things
that I still don't know.

357
00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.519
Hmm.

358
00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:54.720
Rung,

359
00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.240
do you mind

360
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.559
if I show you

361
00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.759
some of my old work?

362
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.400
I don't mind.

363
00:29:28.279 --> 00:29:29.599
This one

364
00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.319
is the 2019 collection.

365
00:29:34.599 --> 00:29:37.319
Lovely complementary colors.

366
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.240
There's beige, pastel...

367
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.920
Hmm.

368
00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:48.960
They look very masculine.

369
00:29:54.759 --> 00:29:56.240
This one

370
00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.839
is from my first collection.

371
00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:10.480
It's very beautiful.

372
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.759
Rung?

373
00:30:41.599 --> 00:30:43.599
Tan! Tan!

374
00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:47.960
What's wrong, Rung?

375
00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:49.119
I have a headache.

376
00:30:50.519 --> 00:30:51.720
You should rest.

377
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.240
I think

378
00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.400
that's all for today. I'm sorry.

379
00:31:16.319 --> 00:31:17.599
I'd like the spicy fish, please.

380
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.680
Not only did you not eat
the food I cooked,

381
00:31:26.079 --> 00:31:28.319
you're also taking me out for
a meal. Why are you so heartless?

382
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.119
You dare to call it food?

383
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.759
I cooked with my feelings
just like you told me to.

384
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.799
What feelings?

385
00:31:37.559 --> 00:31:38.559
The feelings of...

386
00:31:41.119 --> 00:31:42.119
The feelings of...

387
00:31:43.519 --> 00:31:44.680
La-la.

388
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.640
Enjoyment.
The feelings of enjoyment.

389
00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:52.200
It's already enjoyable
just by inhaling the smell.

390
00:31:53.599 --> 00:31:55.160
Really? Thanks.

391
00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.160
I was being sarcastic.

392
00:32:06.279 --> 00:32:07.799
Uhh...oh?

393
00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.000
I finally found you, Porsch.

394
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.279
I'll give you a lift.

395
00:32:30.319 --> 00:32:33.279
It's okay. You should stay
and take care of Rung.

396
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.480
I'm worried about her.

397
00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:36.519
Mmm.

398
00:32:37.519 --> 00:32:40.480
By the way, you've been
doing alright lately, right?

399
00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.480
Why?

400
00:32:46.319 --> 00:32:48.400
You seem more stressed than usual.

401
00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.640
I told you if there's anything,
you can tell me right away.

402
00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.160
Mmm.

403
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.680
It's nothing.

404
00:33:01.039 --> 00:33:02.200
It's just about work.

405
00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:05.359
Well, it's almost event day

406
00:33:05.359 --> 00:33:07.359
but nothing's finished.

407
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.039
It's probably going to rain soon.

408
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.920
You might not want to tell me,

409
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.039
but your heart will.

410
00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.400
We're lucky we have
our special powers.

411
00:33:49.279 --> 00:33:51.759
Alright. Tell me

412
00:33:52.119 --> 00:33:54.519
what's troubling you.

413
00:33:59.119 --> 00:34:00.480
It's okay.

414
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.799
You can trust me.

415
00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:09.880
I love you.

416
00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:13.329
I love you.

417
00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:14.840
I love you.

418
00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.960
I love you.

419
00:34:16.079 --> 00:34:18.400
I love you. I love you.

420
00:34:18.519 --> 00:34:21.480
I love you. I love you.

421
00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:33.519
I love you too.

422
00:34:35.639 --> 00:34:37.960
It's okay if you don't
want to say it right now.

423
00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.480
You don't have to.

424
00:34:50.519 --> 00:34:51.639
Is something wrong?

425
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.360
Nothing.

426
00:34:56.519 --> 00:34:58.480
Should we go inside for now?

427
00:34:58.679 --> 00:35:00.159
I'll give you a lift
once the rain stops.

428
00:35:11.329 --> 00:35:12.360
Why are you here?

429
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:15.079
I'm here to take you home.

430
00:35:15.769 --> 00:35:16.769
I'm not going.

431
00:35:22.639 --> 00:35:24.079
Is something the matter?

432
00:35:26.199 --> 00:35:27.400
Are you Mind?

433
00:35:29.809 --> 00:35:33.360
Excuse me, but I need to
bring Porsch home.

434
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:35.360
I said I'm not going.
Didn't you hear me?

435
00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.039
Porsch, you know what's going to
happen if you defy Dad.

436
00:35:41.039 --> 00:35:42.360
Are you my sister or my mother?

437
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.599
I know and I'm used to it by now.
And I'm not going.

438
00:35:47.039 --> 00:35:48.360
Seize him.

439
00:35:48.639 --> 00:35:50.239
Wait, wait, wait! Be gentle!

440
00:35:50.239 --> 00:35:52.559
- Hey!
- Be gentle!

441
00:35:52.559 --> 00:35:54.440
Hold on! What are you doing?

442
00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.960
Porsch!

443
00:35:59.289 --> 00:36:01.079
Listen to me carefully,

444
00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.809
you have to come back
and get married.

445
00:36:06.769 --> 00:36:07.840
- Huh?
- Huh?

446
00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:32.159
You also look cute

447
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.960
when your hair's wet.

448
00:36:34.769 --> 00:36:36.769
I want to give you a noogie.

449
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.440
Hey, I heard that.

450
00:36:44.679 --> 00:36:47.480
Oops, busted.

451
00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:51.519
Really!

452
00:36:52.809 --> 00:36:54.599
You're crazy.

453
00:36:55.519 --> 00:36:57.000
But no matter how crazy you are,

454
00:36:57.679 --> 00:36:59.599
I still love you.

455
00:37:00.719 --> 00:37:02.920
Hey, I can hear you too.

456
00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.639
You still love me
no matter how crazy I am, right?

457
00:37:10.719 --> 00:37:12.639
I won't think about you anymore.

458
00:37:16.039 --> 00:37:18.599
I'll only think
about work, work, work.

459
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.719
Rin, don't get all worked up
about it.

460
00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:24.880
You'll come up with something.

461
00:37:28.119 --> 00:37:30.809
I just want to come up
with a new concept.

462
00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.039
But I don't know where to start.

463
00:37:36.329 --> 00:37:37.329
Then,

464
00:37:37.719 --> 00:37:40.039
should you start
from something that's around you?

465
00:37:41.519 --> 00:37:42.679
Around me?

466
00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:48.199
Like, thinking of me a lot.

467
00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.809
That has nothing to do with it!

468
00:37:59.719 --> 00:38:00.719
Rin,

469
00:38:01.239 --> 00:38:04.559
if it only rains in certain areas,

470
00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.559
do you think we'll still
be able to hear each other?

471
00:38:10.199 --> 00:38:11.519
Do you mean

472
00:38:11.719 --> 00:38:13.679
if it rains where I am

473
00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.400
but not where you are?

474
00:38:17.559 --> 00:38:18.559
Mmm.

475
00:38:19.039 --> 00:38:22.920
Sometimes the rain clouds don't
surround both of us.

476
00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:27.519
Like us, we fight and we're good
to each other sometimes.

477
00:38:43.039 --> 00:38:44.480
We're good to each other

478
00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:46.599
and we fight sometimes?

479
00:38:51.119 --> 00:38:52.119
That's it!

480
00:38:53.809 --> 00:38:54.809
What?

481
00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:56.920
Thank you so much!

482
00:38:57.239 --> 00:38:59.440
You're an inspiration to me again!

483
00:39:03.679 --> 00:39:04.840
Give me 500.

484
00:39:08.199 --> 00:39:09.329
What for?

485
00:39:09.679 --> 00:39:10.960
For my idea.

486
00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.639
What's the matter?

487
00:39:23.289 --> 00:39:24.440
I was only joking.

488
00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.329
The rain's stopped.

489
00:39:32.159 --> 00:39:34.239
I should go.

490
00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.920
- Hold on.
- Hmm?

491
00:39:38.639 --> 00:39:39.960
Don't you want to
stay a little longer?

492
00:39:44.079 --> 00:39:47.079
I want to go back
and think about work.

493
00:39:54.519 --> 00:39:55.679
Then we'll see each other later.

494
00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.440
Mmm.

495
00:40:00.639 --> 00:40:01.639
Okay.

496
00:40:10.639 --> 00:40:11.840
I'll see you later.

497
00:40:39.159 --> 00:40:41.360
You're the one who kidnapped me?

498
00:40:45.519 --> 00:40:46.880
Why did you do that?

499
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.719
Because I love Tanthai.

500
00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.840
I know everything about him

501
00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:02.239
and everyone that's around him.

502
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.239
I'm going to report you
to the police

503
00:41:08.809 --> 00:41:10.769
and tell Tan

504
00:41:10.769 --> 00:41:12.289
that you're that insane fan.

505
00:41:12.289 --> 00:41:14.039
Are you sure
you're going to do that?

506
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.840
You've always wondered, haven't you?

507
00:41:20.599 --> 00:41:23.880
About your collection
that looks like Rung's?

508
00:41:27.289 --> 00:41:28.679
Do you think

509
00:41:29.809 --> 00:41:32.039
that Tanthai's never seen
that sketchbook?

510
00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:44.039
Rung!

511
00:41:49.679 --> 00:41:50.880
I know

512
00:41:51.289 --> 00:41:52.809
that you and Tanthai are connected

513
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.329
through some kind of special power.

514
00:41:56.599 --> 00:41:58.360
You probably think

515
00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:02.329
it's a miracle from heaven
that's meant for the both of you.

516
00:42:04.679 --> 00:42:06.159
But you probably don't know

517
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.880
that your power

518
00:42:08.599 --> 00:42:10.239
has harmed someone.

519
00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.840
If I explain,

520
00:42:14.809 --> 00:42:16.039
Tan will understand.

521
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.679
Rung is everything

522
00:42:21.079 --> 00:42:22.719
to Tanthai.

523
00:42:24.719 --> 00:42:26.880
I don't think he'll be
able to accept it.

524
00:42:31.809 --> 00:42:32.840
Tan.

525
00:42:33.519 --> 00:42:34.599
Yes, Rung?

526
00:42:38.119 --> 00:42:39.239
Rarin...

527
00:42:40.559 --> 00:42:41.769
The woman named Rarin.

528
00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.480
Stay away from her.

529
00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.639
She's the one who made me
lose the will to live.

530
00:42:56.809 --> 00:42:59.000
If you don't want this
to be exposed,

531
00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:02.559
then give that power to me!

532
00:43:05.679 --> 00:43:06.719
Give it to me!

533
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.769
I want you to keep an eye
on this nurse, Mind.

534
00:43:27.519 --> 00:43:29.239
I don't really trust her.

535
00:43:29.639 --> 00:43:31.079
What are you thinking about?

536
00:43:31.719 --> 00:43:33.480
Why is it so difficult

537
00:43:33.769 --> 00:43:35.199
for you to start a rumor
about a guy?

538
00:43:35.199 --> 00:43:37.239
The collection I was designing

539
00:43:37.519 --> 00:43:40.519
was stolen by the brand
called Rarin.

540
00:43:41.199 --> 00:43:43.840
She's the one who made me
lose the will to live.

541
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.679
Thank you very much, Tan.

542
00:43:46.199 --> 00:43:48.440
Rung's idea is really great.
