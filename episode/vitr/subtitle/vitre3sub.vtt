1
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.280
I'm here now.

2
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.280
I'll help you.

3
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.199
So what's going on
between you and Rarin?

4
00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:50.599
You've been spending a lot of
time together recently.

5
00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.960
Is there going to be some kind of
sudden announcement?

6
00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.199
Please answer the question.

7
00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.159
We're just colleagues
in a brand campaign.

8
00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.960
We might seem close
but it's all work.

9
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.879
What about the rumor that you're
already intimate?

10
00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.560
Please answer the question.

11
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.280
So are you two together now?

12
00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.439
I'm not sure how the rumor
got started.

13
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.400
But a rumor is a rumor.

14
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.639
Rumor has it

15
00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.199
that Rarin's covering
all of your expenses.

16
00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.039
We're just friends.

17
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.120
We're just friends.

18
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.400
We're in talks about me
becoming the muse.

19
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.319
We'll keep you posted on our
future collaborations.

20
00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.000
We'll keep you posted on our
future collaborations.

21
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.039
Okay. That's all for now.
He has somewhere else to be.

22
00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:49.240
Thank you.

23
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.319
Is it going to kill him
to answer the question?

24
00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.680
I don't know.
There's something between them.

25
00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.759
Okay.

26
00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.960
We'll be right there.

27
00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.039
I wanted to compliment you.

28
00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:06.039
You did a really good job
answering the questions.

29
00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.439
I was surprised to hear

30
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.280
that you're going
to be Rarin's muse.

31
00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.479
Says who? I didn't say that.

32
00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.120
You said it just now.

33
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.879
We're in talks

34
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.800
about me becoming

35
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.639
the muse.

36
00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.730
She's just assuming things.

37
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.480
What's up with you? I'm confused.

38
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.439
Well...

39
00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.240
Forget it. You wouldn't
understand it anyway.

40
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.800
Well, gee-whiz.

41
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.399
Only the two of you can understand?

42
00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:40.680
What is it with you and Rarin?

43
00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:42.759
You don't have to tell other people,
but you can still tell me.

44
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.399
What? There's nothing.

45
00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:46.839
- Nothing?
- What? Nothing.

46
00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:47.920
Nothing at all?

47
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.360
That's right. Who would want to mess
around with that dreamy girl?

48
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.560
Dreamy?

49
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.170
- What!?
- Nothing.

50
00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:56.360
Don't have a guilty conscience.

51
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.959
Hello?

52
00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:05.610
Just a second.

53
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.680
Hey,

54
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.560
the dreamy girl
wants to talk to you.

55
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.680
Where are you going?

56
00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.439
Don't follow me!

57
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.399
Would he prefer tea or coffee?

58
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.480
What if he doesn't want anything?

59
00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:38.839
I don't want anything.

60
00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:04.439
I'm sorry for bothering you.

61
00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:05.519
Yes,

62
00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:07.160
you're bothering me.

63
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.000
I don't want to bother you often.

64
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.279
I called you here because of work.

65
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.319
Work?

66
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.680
It's about you
being the muse for me.

67
00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:25.160
Isn't that right?

68
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.879
Another thing,

69
00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.279
stop assuming things.

70
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.000
- It's very annoying that...
- Alright.

71
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.279
I'm sorry.

72
00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:36.839
I was just playing along.

73
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.199
But only because I wanted to clear
things up between us.

74
00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:45.639
Why do you have to be so annoyed?

75
00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:48.079
I saved you, you know?

76
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.519
She's right.

77
00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:54.839
She saved me.

78
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.920
Right?

79
00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.399
Hey,

80
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.480
get out of my head right now.

81
00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.040
That's impossible.

82
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.560
Tan?

83
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.680
Tan?

84
00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:19.800
I'll scan the code.

85
00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:21.439
Wait, Tan!

86
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.879
I haven't finished talking yet.

87
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.839
Where are you going? Wait for me.

88
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.759
Stop following me.

89
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.120
But the press already thinks that

90
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.199
you're ready to be my muse.

91
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.720
Only because you made me say so.

92
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:47.600
Besides, you controlled my lips.

93
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.680
You were the one
that said we're still in talks.

94
00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:55.600
You're a newcomer to the industry
so you might not know yet.

95
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.839
But it's called
indirect confirmation.

96
00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:02.399
And the press

97
00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:04.959
was fine with the interview.

98
00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:07.160
Isn't it good

99
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.439
that you're changing
your image for the better?

100
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.040
You sly fox.

101
00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:18.920
It's called being a visionary.

102
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.519
Is this my life or yours?

103
00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:25.600
I'm starting to wonder.

104
00:08:27.279 --> 00:08:28.920
I'd also like to know

105
00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:32.120
what made you hate me this much.

106
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.759
It was never like this in the past.

107
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.090
Let's just say that
I have my own reasons.

108
00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:45.039
From now on, let's stay out of
each other's business.

109
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.159
But I've only just met you.

110
00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:52.399
You used to comfort me
when I was sad.

111
00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:57.090
You used to be the prince on
a white horse who would save me.

112
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.039
But look at you now,

113
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.840
you're rude.

114
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.519
You're inconsiderate.

115
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.450
You try to make
other people hate you.

116
00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:09.090
Hold on. You're probably assuming

117
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.960
that I'm that kind of person.

118
00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:17.000
Why don't you let other people know
that side of yours?

119
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.879
Why don't you let me
do something for you?

120
00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.120
Why do you have to push me away?

121
00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:26.960
Hey, watch out!

122
00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:51.519
I'll think about it.

123
00:09:52.759 --> 00:09:53.840
Really?

124
00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:56.240
- Alright. I'm going now.
- Wait!

125
00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.639
Are you free today?

126
00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:03.559
I saved you.

127
00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:37.759
Rin.

128
00:10:41.919 --> 00:10:43.279
What on earth are you wearing?

129
00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:45.000
Well,

130
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.240
you told me to come in disguise.

131
00:10:47.399 --> 00:10:48.480
So here I am.

132
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.210
I told you to come in disguise

133
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:55.639
so that you wouldn't
attract attention.

134
00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.799
But isn't this going to attract even
more attention?

135
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.679
Here.

136
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.720
No one will recognize me now.

137
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.039
Come on.

138
00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:15.480
What?

139
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.240
Hey, wait up!

140
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.559
When you said we were
going shopping,

141
00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:25.240
I thought you meant to shop for
clothes, shoes, or bags.

142
00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:28.720
I didn't think you were going to
shop for traditional fabrics.

143
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.080
Because you're part of
our brand's image.

144
00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:39.000
This year, the French Embassy

145
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.360
is organizing a charity auction with
the Thai Textile Society.

146
00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:46.320
They're inviting
lots of celebrities.

147
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.279
So I came here to look

148
00:11:48.399 --> 00:11:51.840
for some fabric for the outfit
that you're going to wear there.

149
00:11:53.759 --> 00:11:54.840
Hmm?

150
00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.720
No, I don't want to.

151
00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.159
I think this yellow color suits you.

152
00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:02.360
You can't just agree on everything.

153
00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:04.759
Why not?

154
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.759
Who came up with the rule that
men must wear dark colors

155
00:12:08.759 --> 00:12:11.320
and women must wear sweet tones?

156
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.720
Any gender can wear whatever
color they want.

157
00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:16.159
I'm not talking about the color.

158
00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:29.559
Just give it up.

159
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.039
At the moment, you don't know
how much

160
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.480
of a sucker I am.

161
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.679
So...

162
00:12:39.919 --> 00:12:42.279
Do you know that Thai silk

163
00:12:42.279 --> 00:12:44.320
is very high quality?

164
00:12:44.679 --> 00:12:47.919
But people often overlook it.

165
00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:50.759
Just like you.

166
00:12:51.039 --> 00:12:52.799
You like to overlook yourself.

167
00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:12.919
What fabric is that, Rung?
It's so old-fashioned.

168
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.320
Old-fashioned?

169
00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:17.720
This is silk.

170
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:20.159
It's traditional Thai wisdom.

171
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.639
The fabric is fluffy,

172
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.440
soft,

173
00:13:24.879 --> 00:13:26.240
and weighty.

174
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.559
It is timeless, Tan.

175
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.080
You always overlook
the quality of things,

176
00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.720
just like how you overlook yourself.

177
00:13:40.039 --> 00:13:41.399
This again, Rung?

178
00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.519
You know I'm such a loser.

179
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.600
Come on.

180
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.879
You might not see your own worth.

181
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.759
But one day,

182
00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:56.960
someone will see you like I do.

183
00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:59.360
Understand?

184
00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.159
Mmm.

185
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.080
Tan?

186
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.559
Tan?

187
00:14:09.399 --> 00:14:10.480
Tan?

188
00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:13.720
Can you help me choose the fabric?

189
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.679
Mmm.

190
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.679
- Hello, Kan.
- Hello, Rarin.

191
00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:41.960
There.

192
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.120
Are you also here to pick out
some Thai fabrics?

193
00:14:46.399 --> 00:14:49.679
No, I'm just here to observe.

194
00:14:51.799 --> 00:14:54.000
Do you like this one?

195
00:14:56.799 --> 00:14:57.960
I do.

196
00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.039
I think it's going to look
very beautiful as a suit.

197
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.519
A suit?

198
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.279
Oh.

199
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.240
A suit for Tanthai.

200
00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:19.200
So the rumor about him
being the muse

201
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.559
is true?

202
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.720
So you brought him here

203
00:15:24.279 --> 00:15:26.039
to pick out the fabric in person.

204
00:15:34.519 --> 00:15:36.799
- Hello, Kan.
- Hello, Tanthai.

205
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.799
Is that your new look?

206
00:15:38.799 --> 00:15:40.080
Or maybe this is...

207
00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.759
...the new look for Rarin Couture.

208
00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.399
It's not.

209
00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:53.759
I just wanted him to try dressing
in different styles

210
00:15:53.759 --> 00:15:56.000
to find out what works for him.

211
00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.279
I initially thought it was
some kind of out-of-this-world

212
00:16:00.519 --> 00:16:01.919
fashion experiment.

213
00:16:03.879 --> 00:16:08.679
But I'm looking forward to seeing
your work at the Thai textile event.

214
00:16:09.639 --> 00:16:12.399
I'm looking forward
to seeing yours too.

215
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:16.960
I hope you get the highest bid,
just like all the other years.

216
00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:23.440
No matter how much we earn
from these charity events,

217
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:25.679
we usually return it to society.

218
00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:31.120
If you think this piece of fabric

219
00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.720
will look nice as a suit,

220
00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:36.240
then you should

221
00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:37.919
use it to make a suit.

222
00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:40.559
I'd like to see
Tanthai wear it as well.

223
00:16:43.559 --> 00:16:44.960
You're giving it to me?

224
00:16:46.639 --> 00:16:47.720
That's right.

225
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.000
I'm only here to observe.

226
00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.320
Besides,

227
00:16:51.799 --> 00:16:53.000
my brand

228
00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.279
only uses custom handmade
Thai fabric.

229
00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.639
I have to excuse myself now.

230
00:17:02.799 --> 00:17:04.680
I have to catch a flight to New York
this evening.

231
00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:10.890
Next time we meet, I hope to see Tan
dressed like this again.

232
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:13.960
I'll see you later.

233
00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:22.240
So is he complimenting my outfit?

234
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.480
There's a lovely cafe around here.

235
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.839
Let's take a rest first.

236
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.240
Once we've rested, I'd like to look
for some buttons.

237
00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.359
This still isn't enough?

238
00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:49.200
This is just the beginning.

239
00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.890
If you know that you're going
shopping with a girl,

240
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.960
you have to be mentally prepared.

241
00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.759
Mmm!

242
00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.440
Now that you know,

243
00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:01.920
then let's get going!

244
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.279
- Rin!
- No!

245
00:18:06.279 --> 00:18:07.359
Eh!?

246
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.480
I haven't even said anything.
Wait until I'm finished.

247
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.839
I haven't even brought out the ring.

248
00:18:11.839 --> 00:18:15.200
Porche, you've probably proposed to
me 100 times already.

249
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.410
It's good that you're here alone.

250
00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.720
If you brought a flash mob
like at the graduation,

251
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:21.039
you're dead.

252
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.799
Are you crazy? Who would do that?

253
00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:32.279
You're so funny!

254
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:39.559
It's like you have a sixth sense.

255
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.960
By the way, hon...

256
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.000
Porsche, can you stop
calling me "hon"?

257
00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:47.559
Well, I...

258
00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.200
I'm used to it.
Can't you make an exception?

259
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.440
Do you want me to start calling you
"Mr. Porsche?"

260
00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:54.960
You're bullying me.

261
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:57.200
I deferred my degree so I could
graduate with you.

262
00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.559
We're the same age now.

263
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.079
I'll feel old if you call me mister.

264
00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:03.039
What kind of logic is this?

265
00:19:08.839 --> 00:19:12.359
Anyway, how did you know
that I was here?

266
00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:14.759
I know everything about you, Rin.

267
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.279
Oh, hey!

268
00:19:17.279 --> 00:19:19.650
I just saw you! How are you doing?

269
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:21.559
- You just saw me?
- Yes.

270
00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.480
Why are you here together?

271
00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.200
Don't tell me you're on a date.

272
00:19:25.839 --> 00:19:28.279
Think what you want.

273
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.559
I came to buy Thai fabrics

274
00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:32.650
for the event at the French Embassy.

275
00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.440
I asked him to help carry
some things for me.

276
00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.720
Oh, it's about work.

277
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:40.799
So he's the bellboy?

278
00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:41.960
Is this a hotel?

279
00:19:43.559 --> 00:19:45.440
Anyway, I'm also going to
that event.

280
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.559
But I haven't gotten an outfit yet.

281
00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:49.079
Can you help me with that?

282
00:19:49.359 --> 00:19:51.200
As for the stuff you bought,
it's a piece of cake.

283
00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.039
I'll make a call to have them
delivered to your studio.

284
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.319
Then,

285
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.319
you can take these,

286
00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.839
Bro.

287
00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:03.890
Bye.

288
00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:06.680
Tan! Tanthai!

289
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:09.720
- How am I going to get home?
- You can come with me.

290
00:20:12.599 --> 00:20:13.680
See?

291
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.079
And who's that? Tong Twopee?

292
00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.890
He's not.

293
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.079
Hey, Southside, baby!

294
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.079
Whoa.

295
00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:35.920
It looks like it's going to rain.

296
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.960
You'd be in trouble if you had to
carry everything by yourself.

297
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.650
Thanks.

298
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:41.799
My pleasure.

299
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:44.440
- Hello, Rin.
- Hello.

300
00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.440
Hello.

301
00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:52.680
Rin, what's wrong?

302
00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.680
Are you sick?

303
00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.759
Do you have a fever?

304
00:20:57.559 --> 00:20:59.960
It's nothing. I'm probably
just not getting enough sleep.

305
00:21:00.599 --> 00:21:01.720
As always.

306
00:21:01.839 --> 00:21:04.519
Once you've finished, take some
medicine and rest.

307
00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.559
Alright?

308
00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:09.599
Come on!

309
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.039
Get some rest, okay?

310
00:21:12.759 --> 00:21:13.839
Mmm!

311
00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:16.559
Mmm! No need to be embarrassed.

312
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.279
Mmm!

313
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.559
Rin?

314
00:21:23.759 --> 00:21:24.839
Rin?

315
00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.650
What about a kiss goodbye?

316
00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:31.559
Darn.

317
00:21:32.319 --> 00:21:34.279
Hmph, really?

318
00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:37.119
Mai, I'll stay at the condo tonight.
I'm not coming home.

319
00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.720
Alright. I know.

320
00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.920
You've been staying over at
the condo a lot lately.

321
00:21:43.119 --> 00:21:45.519
Are you trying to stay close
to someone?

322
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.720
Don't stir the pot.

323
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.170
And that Thai textile gala,

324
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.039
I didn't know
that I have to be there.

325
00:21:52.039 --> 00:21:54.200
How did you find out
about it so quickly?

326
00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.000
Of course, you're close to Rin.

327
00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.480
Well, you always accept jobs
without my knowledge.

328
00:22:02.359 --> 00:22:03.960
Well, I'm your manager.

329
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.640
I have to accept jobs for you.

330
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.319
If I ask you, you'd refuse.

331
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.720
How do you know that I'd refuse?

332
00:22:12.119 --> 00:22:13.839
Oh my gosh,

333
00:22:13.839 --> 00:22:16.119
don't tell me you're
interested in going?

334
00:22:16.119 --> 00:22:17.279
Are my ears playing tricks on me?

335
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:18.960
I wasn't saying that.

336
00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.200
Can't I become
interested in Thai textiles?

337
00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.440
Now that's news.
You never said so before.

338
00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:31.079
How come you're interested
all of a sudden?

339
00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.240
Actually, it's just...

340
00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:41.480
She reminds me of Rung.

341
00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.039
Mmm. I understand how you feel.

342
00:22:50.319 --> 00:22:51.799
How is Rung doing today?

343
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:00.559
She's sleeping peacefully as always.

344
00:23:01.759 --> 00:23:02.839
Then,

345
00:23:03.319 --> 00:23:05.839
I'm going to bed now.
Please take care of the house.

346
00:23:06.319 --> 00:23:08.359
Okay. Look after yourself.

347
00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:12.599
Anyway, I'm not sure if the shoot
will be canceled or not tomorrow.

348
00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:14.200
I heard there's going to be a storm.

349
00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:16.559
I'll tell you if it gets canceled.

350
00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:18.480
Okay.

351
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.279
- Later, then.
- Bye.

352
00:23:27.079 --> 00:23:29.119
Our brother is growing up.

353
00:25:46.599 --> 00:25:47.680
Tan!

354
00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.720
Tan!

355
00:25:52.039 --> 00:25:53.119
Tan!

356
00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.720
Tan!

357
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.519
Tan!

358
00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.720
Help me!

359
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.960
Tan!

360
00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.920
Is that you, Rin?

361
00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.640
Tan.

362
00:26:46.359 --> 00:26:47.440
Rin?

363
00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.200
Tanthai, please help me.

364
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.119
Help me.

365
00:27:19.359 --> 00:27:20.839
Hang in there, Rin.

366
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.599
I'm coming to see you.

367
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.400
Tan.

368
00:27:29.039 --> 00:27:31.279
- I can't take it anymore.
- Rin!

369
00:27:32.119 --> 00:27:33.480
Rin, can you hear me?

370
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.720
Help.

371
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.000
Hello?

372
00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:01.880
Hello?

373
00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.119
Porsche, go help Rin. Quick.

374
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.119
Hang in there, Rin.

375
00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.319
Rin?

376
00:28:22.279 --> 00:28:23.359
Rin?

377
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.279
Rin?

378
00:28:26.839 --> 00:28:27.920
Rin?

379
00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.359
Rin?

380
00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.480
Rin?

381
00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.720
Good morning!

382
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.079
You're up?

383
00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:12.200
How are you doing?

384
00:29:12.319 --> 00:29:14.079
Are you hungry?

385
00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.440
- I'm not.
- I've brought you some fruit.

386
00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.599
Are you thirsty? Just tell
me if you need anything.

387
00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:21.519
Let me check your fever.

388
00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:26.039
Mmm.

389
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.079
No fever.

390
00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:34.799
You'll be able to go home soon.

391
00:29:35.599 --> 00:29:36.799
Mmm.

392
00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.880
It's probably the lack of sleep.

393
00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:49.079
The world is spinning.

394
00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:51.880
Exactly.

395
00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.279
What are you laughing about?

396
00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.960
It's deja vu, just like
when we're studying.

397
00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.079
Pulling an all-nighter,
being sleep deprived,

398
00:29:59.079 --> 00:30:01.000
the world spinning,
and then passing out.

399
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.519
Eat up.

400
00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.599
Why are we reminiscing now?

401
00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.960
How did I get here?

402
00:30:15.799 --> 00:30:16.880
You still don't know.

403
00:30:17.119 --> 00:30:18.799
Last night, you were
unconscious at your studio.

404
00:30:18.799 --> 00:30:20.160
I was so worried.

405
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.799
You brought me to the hospital?

406
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:28.119
Of course. Who else if it's not me?

407
00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.559
Rin!

408
00:30:31.799 --> 00:30:32.880
Rin!

409
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.480
Rin!

410
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.279
Well, it's nothing.

411
00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:42.680
How come you came to help me?

412
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.920
I thought you went home.

413
00:30:49.359 --> 00:30:50.640
Because it's you.

414
00:30:51.079 --> 00:30:53.079
I know everything about you.

415
00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.160
Where you are, what you're doing,
and what time you'll be home.

416
00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.720
No matter what, I'll always come
to see you.

417
00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.240
You're exaggerating.

418
00:31:01.599 --> 00:31:02.680
Eat up.

419
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.440
Come on. Would you like some grapes?

420
00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:10.920
Mmm.

421
00:31:11.279 --> 00:31:12.359
Eat up.

422
00:31:21.039 --> 00:31:23.440
I'll be right back. Just a sec.

423
00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.440
Where are you going?

424
00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.559
Miss me already?

425
00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:29.680
I don't have to go
if you want me to stay.

426
00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.160
Just go wherever you want.

427
00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.119
Ouch.

428
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.599
Rin's overworked and sleep-deprived.

429
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:39.960
So she's got vertigo.

430
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.079
She'll be able to go home tomorrow.

431
00:32:48.799 --> 00:32:49.880
That's good.

432
00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.519
Good thing
I called the right person.

433
00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.039
That's right.

434
00:32:57.079 --> 00:32:58.400
You called the right person.

435
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.160
I can look after Rin.

436
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:06.759
Don't you think she's lovely?

437
00:33:09.599 --> 00:33:10.680
Hmm?

438
00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.519
Everyone close to her
always says she is.

439
00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.839
You've been working together a lot.

440
00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:19.759
But don't overthink it.
It's all about work.

441
00:33:21.079 --> 00:33:22.160
How do you know?

442
00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:27.400
Do you think I can't see it?

443
00:33:31.759 --> 00:33:32.880
You're in love with Rin.

444
00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.400
Me? In love with Rin?

445
00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.960
If there's nothing else,
I have to go now.

446
00:33:42.519 --> 00:33:44.279
I don't want you going near
her anymore.

447
00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.920
Her life is chaotic enough as it is.

448
00:33:51.119 --> 00:33:54.000
It's gotten more chaotic
since she met you.

449
00:33:55.079 --> 00:33:56.240
I hope you understand.

450
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.799
Then please take care of her.

451
00:34:03.039 --> 00:34:04.960
Don't let this become a
burden on me again.

452
00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:10.360
Excuse me,

453
00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.960
this is a hospital. Please be quiet.

454
00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.329
Kids these days have
no common sense.

455
00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.199
See? You're annoying.

456
00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.639
You're annoying.

457
00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:24.960
You're a jerk, don't you know that?

458
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.920
- You're an even bigger jerk.
- You're the jerk.

459
00:34:27.079 --> 00:34:28.329
I'm handsome.

460
00:34:28.329 --> 00:34:30.289
I'm a model and an actor.

461
00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:32.880
I'm also a scarecrow.
Isn't that cool?

462
00:34:34.329 --> 00:34:35.679
How can you be proud of that?

463
00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:38.719
It's my nickname from the press.

464
00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:41.079
Do you have one? Oh, you don't.

465
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.039
I'm rich!

466
00:34:47.159 --> 00:34:48.400
You're not rich.

467
00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:49.920
Your dad is.

468
00:34:50.039 --> 00:34:51.159
How do you know that?

469
00:34:51.289 --> 00:34:52.920
Rin's told me everything about you.

470
00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:54.960
I know everything.

471
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.289
You...

472
00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:57.769
rich kid.

473
00:34:58.039 --> 00:34:59.119
Hold on.

474
00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:00.679
Another thing.

475
00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.360
How did you know that Rin was
in a bad state?

476
00:35:19.519 --> 00:35:20.719
Tan!

477
00:35:21.199 --> 00:35:22.920
You're here.
I've been looking for you.

478
00:35:23.039 --> 00:35:24.599
Take it. You forgot it again.

479
00:35:25.159 --> 00:35:26.719
Take it. Come on.

480
00:35:29.199 --> 00:35:30.289
Oh?

481
00:35:31.199 --> 00:35:32.559
Hello, rich kid.

482
00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.119
What a coincidence.

483
00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:40.000
The nurse is looking for you.
Where have you been?

484
00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.920
I bumped into this guy.

485
00:35:47.289 --> 00:35:48.360
Whatever.

486
00:35:49.639 --> 00:35:51.199
Don't forget what we talked about.

487
00:35:58.159 --> 00:35:59.239
What did you talk about?

488
00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:01.719
It's nothing. Let's go home.

489
00:36:01.719 --> 00:36:02.809
Wait.

490
00:36:04.239 --> 00:36:07.769
You asked me to bring you here, but
you're not going to see a doctor?

491
00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.039
Well, I feel better now.

492
00:36:15.599 --> 00:36:16.769
You little...

493
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.000
Rin!

494
00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.639
I've brought some clothes
for you to change into.

495
00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:42.079
There you are.
Pick whichever one you like.

496
00:36:43.079 --> 00:36:46.440
Porsche, are you crazy? Why so many?

497
00:36:47.199 --> 00:36:49.559
I'd like you to be
the most beautiful patient.

498
00:36:50.559 --> 00:36:51.639
Choose one.

499
00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.039
- Can I take your blood pressure?
- Please.

500
00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.809
- I'm sorry about the clothes rack.
- It's okay.

501
00:37:07.769 --> 00:37:08.880
How are you feeling?

502
00:37:09.079 --> 00:37:11.199
Better.

503
00:37:11.199 --> 00:37:12.480
You'll be able to go home soon.

504
00:37:12.599 --> 00:37:14.079
Mmm.

505
00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:17.039
- Please stretch out your arm.
- Okay.

506
00:37:17.159 --> 00:37:18.840
Excuse me.

507
00:37:23.199 --> 00:37:24.809
What are you looking at, Porsche?

508
00:37:25.239 --> 00:37:27.000
Straighten your arm, please.

509
00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:33.809
You'll feel it getting tight.

510
00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.119
- Porsche.
- Hmm?

511
00:37:45.119 --> 00:37:48.599
After this, I'd like
to get some rest.

512
00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:49.719
You can go home, okay?

513
00:37:51.039 --> 00:37:53.559
- Rin, but I think I should...
- Porsche,

514
00:37:55.199 --> 00:37:56.679
I'm sick.

515
00:38:01.079 --> 00:38:03.239
Alright. You can call me anytime.

516
00:38:03.719 --> 00:38:04.840
Mmm.

517
00:38:06.559 --> 00:38:07.639
Nurse,

518
00:38:08.039 --> 00:38:10.039
please look after my future wife.

519
00:38:10.679 --> 00:38:12.119
Of course.

520
00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:16.960
I'm happy for you that you have
someone who worries about you.

521
00:38:18.559 --> 00:38:21.480
All good. Your blood pressure
is normal.

522
00:38:21.769 --> 00:38:23.960
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

523
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.519
What's the matter?

524
00:38:54.809 --> 00:38:57.400
Nothing.

525
00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.239
Where are you?

526
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.039
I'm on set.

527
00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.000
Oh, right.

528
00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.880
Sorry. Am I bothering you?

529
00:39:10.719 --> 00:39:12.000
Is something the matter?

530
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.329
Last night, when it was raining,

531
00:39:17.639 --> 00:39:20.159
did you hear anything?

532
00:39:27.329 --> 00:39:28.400
I don't think so.

533
00:39:29.039 --> 00:39:30.559
I went to bed early.

534
00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.440
Really?

535
00:39:37.519 --> 00:39:40.719
But you called me
so many times last night.

536
00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.920
Is there anything else?

537
00:39:44.239 --> 00:39:45.809
I have to get back to work now.

538
00:39:47.159 --> 00:39:50.329
Oh, there's nothing else. Just go.

539
00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.000
Here.

540
00:40:00.119 --> 00:40:01.199
I don't want any.

541
00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.960
Let's go home.

542
00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:06.559
You little...

543
00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.960
Pay me for the water.

544
00:40:11.079 --> 00:40:13.960
Pay me for the water
and my effort too.

545
00:40:14.159 --> 00:40:15.239
I'm tired.

546
00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:52.880
- Mai.
- What now?

547
00:41:55.039 --> 00:41:58.400
I won't wear Rarin's
clothing anymore.

548
00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.559
Huh?

549
00:42:03.679 --> 00:42:05.079
Are you still sick?

550
00:42:05.079 --> 00:42:07.840
Your brain's on the fritz. Should
you go back and see the doctor?

551
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.880
I said,

552
00:42:12.679 --> 00:42:13.769
I won't wear

553
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.440
Rarin's clothing anymore.

554
00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:44.719
(Available tomorrow? I want to talk
about being the muse and contract.)

555
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.519
Mai.

556
00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.239
I don't want to be
your mannequin anymore.

557
00:43:01.559 --> 00:43:03.199
I won't wear
your clothes ever again.

558
00:43:04.079 --> 00:43:07.360
This is the contract I sent
for you to look over.

559
00:43:07.769 --> 00:43:10.199
I told you that I won't wear
Rarin's clothes anymore.

560
00:43:10.199 --> 00:43:11.920
It's good to be Rarin's muse.

561
00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:13.079
The pay is great too.

562
00:43:13.079 --> 00:43:15.039
- How could you let it pass by?
- No!

563
00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.079
You're such a good actor.

564
00:43:18.079 --> 00:43:20.239
Rin will probably
start to hate you now.

565
00:43:21.199 --> 00:43:22.960
Maybe it's my own misunderstanding

566
00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.329
that you're the prince.

567
00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.920
Actually, no.

568
00:43:27.769 --> 00:43:29.329
That you could become
a better person.
