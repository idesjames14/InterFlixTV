00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:18.879
Hello, Rarin.

2
00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.919
Hello, Kan.

3
00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.120
It seems that your brand

4
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.120
has been in trouble recently.

5
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.370
But it's probably not as bad
as someone at the top

6
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.240
who's trying to cling onto
the pedestal for dear life

7
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.879
because they're afraid someone
might kick them off.

8
00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:54.599
Be careful with what you say and do.
The fashion world is cruel.

9
00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:57.719
There are a lot of
savage beasts around.

10
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.280
I understand.

11
00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:05.840
But I won't surrender
to wrongfulness.

12
00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.400
You said it yourself
that the fashion world is cruel.

13
00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.960
You should watch yourself as well.

14
00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.479
If I was scared,

15
00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.520
do you think

16
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.960
Kritsana would've lasted this long?

17
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.280
And what did you have to
give in exchange?

18
00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.080
Your dignity

19
00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.639
and honor as a fashion designer,

20
00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:33.479
right?

21
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.800
The outcome will be
the judge for everything.

22
00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.400
Another thing,

23
00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.080
I've also invited the owner of Posey

24
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.960
to be in the front row tomorrow.

25
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.199
I'm looking forward to the show.

26
00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:00.080
If you're done,
check over there as well.

27
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.080
Okay.

28
00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.039
We need a little touch-up here too.

29
00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:05.280
Right away.

30
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.759
Okay? And there's this too.

31
00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.039
Can I talk to you now?

32
00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.879
Okay, okay.

33
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.199
Everyone,

34
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:22.959
I know many of you are feeling
uncomfortable about the recent news.

35
00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.519
But I still can't tell you the truth

36
00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:29.079
or give you any details.

37
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.439
But there's one thing
I'd like to tell you.

38
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.680
Thank you very much

39
00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.480
for being a part of today.

40
00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:41.199
If one of you was missing,
I wouldn't be here today.

41
00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.120
I also created this brand with love

42
00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.920
and the belief that everyone

43
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.050
can be a princess and a prince
in their own way.

44
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.920
I don't expect today's
show to be perfect.

45
00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:56.439
But I hope

46
00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.800
that when people wear our clothes,

47
00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:03.000
they will be happy being themselves

48
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.560
and convey this to the audience.

49
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.170
Let's make today's
fashion show memorable!

50
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.360
That was a very nice speech.

51
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.279
I just spoke my mind.

52
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.079
But I'm still very worried.

53
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.040
Come with me.

54
00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.279
Why did you bring me here?

55
00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:02.279
You have to get dressed soon.

56
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.519
Close your eyes.

57
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.839
Can you hear it?

58
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.480
Hear what?

59
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.160
The sound of my heart.

60
00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:17.360
How could I hear it?

61
00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.240
The power is gone.

62
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.560
If you listen carefully,

63
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.519
you'll hear it.

64
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.279
My heart is saying only one thing.

65
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.480
Don't worry.

66
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.800
Just do your best.

67
00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:12.279
Okay.

68
00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:15.120
Do you feel energized now?

69
00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:18.480
Or do you need another hug?

70
00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:19.639
But this time,

71
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.680
it won't be just a hug.

72
00:08:22.959 --> 00:08:23.959
Silly.

73
00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:27.079
Go and get touched up.

74
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.680
Go.

75
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.560
Hurry.

76
00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:31.839
Okay.

77
00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:38.600
This way, please.

78
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.799
This way.

79
00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:40.799
Another one, please.

80
00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:42.559
Another photo.

81
00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.039
Thank you.

82
00:08:46.679 --> 00:08:47.840
This way.

83
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.279
Look at this camera, please.

84
00:08:50.559 --> 00:08:52.159
Do you have a favorite brand?

85
00:08:52.159 --> 00:08:54.360
I'm here to support all of them.

86
00:08:54.759 --> 00:08:56.399
Great.

87
00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:59.090
Hello.

88
00:09:03.759 --> 00:09:05.519
- How is it going?
- Is it okay here?

89
00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:07.840
- I think just leave it that way.
- Okay.

90
00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:10.879
And this one, can you adjust it?

91
00:09:10.879 --> 00:09:12.679
- It tends to protrude here.
- Sure.

92
00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:14.330
- Okay.
- Okay.

93
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.720
Okay.

94
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.090
Okay.

95
00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:24.279
Tan?

96
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:26.519
Why haven't you changed?

97
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.450
- Jib, can you get Tanthai's outfit?
- Okay.

98
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.279
This is yours.
Hurry up and get changed.

99
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.039
And why haven't you changed?

100
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.960
You have to be on stage
as well, don't you?

101
00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:50.879
Only for a second. This is fine.

102
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.399
- Hmm?
- No, you can't.

103
00:09:53.559 --> 00:09:55.240
You're the centerpiece of the show.

104
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.879
I'll get you a makeup artist.

105
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.450
Uh...

106
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.759
Okay. I'll go
and wash my face first.

107
00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:05.039
Hurry up and get changed.

108
00:10:50.519 --> 00:10:52.090
Rarin, can I get an interview?

109
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:55.799
Is it true that you
plagiarized Posey's designs?

110
00:10:55.799 --> 00:10:59.399
Is the plagiarized outfit going
to be included in today's show?

111
00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:01.399
Why do they look so similar?

112
00:11:01.399 --> 00:11:05.120
- That's right.
- Why did you plagiarize?

113
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.759
Please answer me.

114
00:11:06.759 --> 00:11:10.039
Everyone, the press is not
permitted to be in this space.

115
00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:13.159
- Is it true, Rarin?
- Can you answer us?

116
00:11:13.159 --> 00:11:16.279
If you want to know who plagiarized
whom, get a front-row seat

117
00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:17.679
so you can scrutinize
everything from there.

118
00:11:17.919 --> 00:11:20.720
Alright?
There are still seats available.

119
00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:23.600
You should head there now
or you won't get a seat.

120
00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.759
That's right. There's
a lot of good angles there.

121
00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:36.039
Have you forgotten who I managed?

122
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.000
The rest is up to you now. Fight!

123
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.600
Let's go.

124
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.080
Thank you very much.

125
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.120
It was a great show.

126
00:14:03.399 --> 00:14:04.799
He goes all out every year.

127
00:14:06.039 --> 00:14:09.159
I think the concept's
still the same.

128
00:14:09.679 --> 00:14:11.039
Nothing's changed.

129
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.960
Really?

130
00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:25.840
Ready, everyone?

131
00:14:35.519 --> 00:14:37.039
Hello, Anya.

132
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.879
Hello, Kan.

133
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.240
What do you think of my show?

134
00:14:41.679 --> 00:14:44.200
Well, it was standard.

135
00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.279
I'm sorry.

136
00:14:52.279 --> 00:14:55.759
This spot is reserved
for a VIP guest.

137
00:14:57.039 --> 00:15:00.799
And who is your VIP guest?

138
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.000
You'll find out when she gets here.

139
00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:14.120
Are you looking for a seat?

140
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.159
Move over.

141
00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.600
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Please.

142
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.919
Today's show was awesome.

143
00:15:21.919 --> 00:15:24.159
- Did you like it?
- Yes, we did. Right?

144
00:15:24.159 --> 00:15:27.440
The color scheme will
definitely be the trend this year.

145
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.919
Please stay tuned for the next one.

146
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.840
Is everyone ready?

147
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.360
Five,

148
00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:43.600
four,

149
00:15:43.799 --> 00:15:44.879
three,

150
00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:45.919
two,

151
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.080
cue!

152
00:15:59.559 --> 00:16:01.279
Over there!

153
00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:03.279
It's identical.

154
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.080
What is this?

155
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.600
It's uncanny.

156
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:16.919
It's so similar.

157
00:16:16.919 --> 00:16:18.960
Look at that.

158
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.759
Was it this brand
that plagiarized Posey?

159
00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.279
It's so similar.

160
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.639
All of them are. Look through it.

161
00:16:29.159 --> 00:16:30.320
That's right.

162
00:16:33.799 --> 00:16:36.360
It's identical again.

163
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.879
It's typical.
There's nothing special.

164
00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:44.840
I hope it stays that way.

165
00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:58.039
- Hello.
- Hello.

166
00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.440
Hello.

167
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.410
Hello, Kan.

168
00:17:06.279 --> 00:17:08.000
I didn't think you'd come.

169
00:17:08.559 --> 00:17:10.200
And why wouldn't I?

170
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.680
Shouldn't I be in the front row?

171
00:17:14.759 --> 00:17:17.119
Actually, I should've been on stage.

172
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.960
My concept is human nature.

173
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:29.519
So I chose green as the color

174
00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.599
to express it.

175
00:20:32.599 --> 00:20:34.799
But I've been thinking.

176
00:20:35.559 --> 00:20:38.279
Human nature is fluid.

177
00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.319
Everything is impermanent.

178
00:20:43.079 --> 00:20:44.119
Me,

179
00:20:45.079 --> 00:20:46.240
Tan,

180
00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:47.680
Rung,

181
00:20:48.039 --> 00:20:49.200
and everyone.

182
00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:54.319
Everything can be changed
according to time and context.

183
00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:04.799
I've installed a sprinkler
above the stage.

184
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.599
After everyone has come out,

185
00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:12.519
the water will rain down.

186
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:16.119
And the color
of the outfit will change.

187
00:21:17.759 --> 00:21:18.799
That sounds fun.

188
00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:20.599
Just the thought of it makes me
want to be in your show.

189
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.960
I just want to convey
the thoughtfulness and effort

190
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.559
of the people behind the scenes.

191
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.359
Da,

192
00:21:35.079 --> 00:21:36.079
Jib

193
00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.039
and everyone else.

194
00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:42.079
This is good. It feels like
you're shaming Kan.

195
00:21:42.079 --> 00:21:45.410
He can steal all he wants but he can
only steal the outer shells.

196
00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:03.960
Jib,

197
00:22:04.839 --> 00:22:06.279
I want to be alone.

198
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.759
I love you.

199
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.279
I love you too.

200
00:25:23.559 --> 00:25:24.640
Excuse me.

201
00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:29.720
Kan? Kan? Kan?

202
00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:41.920
Well done, Rin!

203
00:25:43.359 --> 00:25:46.960
- Yay!
- Yay!

204
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.960
I hope today's surprise
was fun for everyone.

205
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.759
Thank you for making
today's show our best one yet!

206
00:25:57.759 --> 00:25:59.960
- Yay!
- Yay!

207
00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:35.039
Miki, Rarin's outfit can
change colors. Do you know that?

208
00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:36.400
I didn't know anything about that.

209
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.599
Yours can't. So who came up
with the original idea?

210
00:26:39.599 --> 00:26:42.440
- I don't know.
- So who plagiarized whom?

211
00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.480
That's right. Can you answer?

212
00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.640
Please answer us.

213
00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.200
Kan, you should stop.

214
00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.839
Stop? Stop what?

215
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.720
What did I do to you?

216
00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.400
Do you think ganging up on me

217
00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.000
is going to make it easier to

218
00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.640
take me down?

219
00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:35.799
Impossible.

220
00:27:36.079 --> 00:27:38.839
You use people and
plagiarized other people's work.

221
00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.039
You also ordered a hit on someone.

222
00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.400
How long do you think you'll last

223
00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.880
committing all these evil deeds?

224
00:27:47.559 --> 00:27:48.839
Evil deeds?

225
00:27:51.559 --> 00:27:52.559
Little girl,

226
00:27:52.839 --> 00:27:54.839
you might see it

227
00:27:55.079 --> 00:27:56.759
as superficial and evil.

228
00:27:58.519 --> 00:27:59.559
But I'm sorry.

229
00:28:00.039 --> 00:28:01.640
To me, it's called

230
00:28:02.079 --> 00:28:03.119
survival.

231
00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.759
The world is cruel.

232
00:28:09.759 --> 00:28:13.680
Each of us has to survive
in our own way.

233
00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:19.279
Do you know how difficult it was

234
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.519
to be able to get to this point?

235
00:28:24.799 --> 00:28:25.920
What I did

236
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.799
and what I've been doing

237
00:28:28.519 --> 00:28:29.599
all this time

238
00:28:30.559 --> 00:28:32.119
takes a lot of grit.

239
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.240
There's no one to care for me.

240
00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.319
No one sympathizes with me.

241
00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:39.640
I have nightmares every night.

242
00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:42.440
I wake up and hope it isn't true.

243
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.920
But it is.

244
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.119
It has made me understand

245
00:28:47.119 --> 00:28:49.920
that someone like you
is just a human

246
00:28:52.319 --> 00:28:53.640
with low-level intelligence

247
00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.279
who sees things in black and white,

248
00:29:01.319 --> 00:29:02.640
good and bad,

249
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.759
love and hate.

250
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.240
To put it simply, you're stupid

251
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.160
for falling for my tricks
in this harsh capitalist society.

252
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.440
It's just a game, Rin.

253
00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.880
It's just a game.

254
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.000
You're such a lost cause.

255
00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.240
What about Rung?

256
00:29:27.519 --> 00:29:29.319
She respected you.

257
00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:33.039
But you did that to her!

258
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:36.920
Was she just easy prey to you?

259
00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.160
She was just easy prey to me.

260
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.160
You!

261
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.960
If you don't respect other people

262
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.839
or see them as mere objects,

263
00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.160
you should at least
respect your work.

264
00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.119
And how am I not respecting my work?

265
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.839
How?

266
00:29:54.079 --> 00:29:56.279
And what is
your actual definition of fashion?

267
00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.319
Winning?

268
00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.559
To be at the top?

269
00:30:03.079 --> 00:30:06.119
Or just claiming your territory?

270
00:30:41.359 --> 00:30:44.359
Kan, what is
your definition of fashion?

271
00:30:45.759 --> 00:30:48.839
For me, fashion is

272
00:30:49.599 --> 00:30:52.920
being able to see people happy
when they wear my outfits.

273
00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.839
I believe good outfits design us.

274
00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.599
Cheers.

275
00:30:59.839 --> 00:31:01.279
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

276
00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.240
Let's make a toast.

277
00:31:08.799 --> 00:31:10.400
No one knows

278
00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.960
what the business has done to me.

279
00:31:16.759 --> 00:31:19.720
It's a rotten world
that needs to change.

280
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.799
And the only way to do it
is to be powerful.

281
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.160
You have to be powerful
to be able to change it!

282
00:31:31.559 --> 00:31:34.160
But kids like you
would never understand.

283
00:31:36.519 --> 00:31:37.599
Now that it's come to this,

284
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.039
are you going to still be arrogant?

285
00:31:41.519 --> 00:31:42.720
Aren't you even afraid
of going to jail?

286
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.799
Tanthai, don't you understand
anything I just said?

287
00:31:47.559 --> 00:31:49.119
You still don't know

288
00:31:49.799 --> 00:31:51.240
the reason why

289
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.720
I was able to stay in the business

290
00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.960
for decades?

291
00:32:03.119 --> 00:32:04.119
Mmm.

292
00:32:56.079 --> 00:32:57.079
Oh,

293
00:32:57.359 --> 00:32:58.920
we've worked together
for less than a year.

294
00:32:59.319 --> 00:33:00.799
Are you going to betray me now?

295
00:33:01.119 --> 00:33:02.480
Are you mentally prepared?

296
00:33:03.839 --> 00:33:04.839
As for me,

297
00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.480
I've been ready for a while now.

298
00:33:07.359 --> 00:33:08.680
How much more do you want?

299
00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:12.880
The amount you gave me
is definitely worth it.

300
00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.200
But that guy paid me much more.

301
00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.960
Nice suit.

302
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.759
It's probably expensive.

303
00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:27.240
But it's a shame.

304
00:33:28.119 --> 00:33:29.279
It might get a little dusty.

305
00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.400
- Can I buy that?
- Who are you?

306
00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.599
I'm your customer, of course.

307
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.359
I'd like to buy one more thing.

308
00:33:38.359 --> 00:33:39.559
Your dignity.

309
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.799
- Hey.
- Kan.

310
00:34:02.839 --> 00:34:03.839
Let me go!

311
00:34:13.079 --> 00:34:15.559
I designed them first.
She plagiarized my designs.

312
00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:19.119
I'm sorry. She plagiarized
my designs.

313
00:34:19.559 --> 00:34:21.159
I think I have the right to sue her.

314
00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:25.769
Why can't I? I designed them first.

315
00:34:27.599 --> 00:34:29.239
You have no right to do this to me.

316
00:34:29.519 --> 00:34:31.559
You have no right to do this to me!

317
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.880
I created it with my own hands.

318
00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.880
I created it with my own hands.

319
00:34:59.039 --> 00:35:00.920
How can they just
take it away from me?

320
00:35:05.289 --> 00:35:06.289
Why?

321
00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:09.769
I can't deny that,
during the course of my career,

322
00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.199
I've always met many people

323
00:36:12.199 --> 00:36:15.400
who have tried to enter
the fashion world of Thailand.

324
00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:22.480
The thirst for success
is always there.

325
00:36:24.639 --> 00:36:27.809
But not everyone
who enters will be successful.

326
00:36:28.079 --> 00:36:33.559
The body count on the battlefield
is much higher than fabric scraps.

327
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.079
And even though
this article will be my last

328
00:36:39.079 --> 00:36:41.000
as a columnist,

329
00:36:41.159 --> 00:36:45.840
this year's Bangkok Fashion Week
will forever be a lesson to me.

330
00:36:50.289 --> 00:36:53.079
If the fashion world is a house,

331
00:36:54.519 --> 00:36:58.039
I've always seen Kritsana
as my younger brother.

332
00:37:00.719 --> 00:37:04.960
But today, Kritsana still has
the same concept and theme.

333
00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:10.289
Even though you can't take
your eyes off it,

334
00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.639
there was no improvement.

335
00:37:14.289 --> 00:37:17.239
It still behaves like
the giant of the runway

336
00:37:18.159 --> 00:37:19.880
without knowing

337
00:37:20.159 --> 00:37:24.599
the next brand to be onstage
would utterly destroy everything

338
00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:27.119
like an atomic bomb.

339
00:37:28.239 --> 00:37:31.840
(An atomic bomb)

340
00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.559
I'm talking about Rarin,

341
00:37:50.719 --> 00:37:53.599
the girl next door with big dreams

342
00:37:53.719 --> 00:37:55.809
who's very ambitious.

343
00:37:55.809 --> 00:37:56.809
Her love,

344
00:37:57.159 --> 00:37:58.239
dreams,

345
00:37:58.519 --> 00:38:00.960
and desire to be number one

346
00:38:01.519 --> 00:38:04.840
screamed out loud
throughout the collection

347
00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.289
and easily penetrated
the hearts of the people.

348
00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:14.769
The first protagonist who fulfilled
the dream of the girl named Rarin

349
00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.519
was Tanthai,

350
00:38:17.119 --> 00:38:20.480
a scandalous model and actor.

351
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.769
He stepped onto the runway
as the prince of the rainy season

352
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.329
without any traces of being
the troublemaker of showbiz.

353
00:38:32.639 --> 00:38:36.079
Also, the final hidden tactic

354
00:38:36.079 --> 00:38:40.400
fearlessly challenged the definition
and limit of the Thai fashion world.

355
00:38:41.199 --> 00:38:43.159
I shall define it as

356
00:38:44.559 --> 00:38:45.880
"miraculous".

357
00:38:51.289 --> 00:38:53.840
This girl has taught me

358
00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.880
that by having good people,

359
00:38:57.519 --> 00:38:58.639
good friends,

360
00:38:59.599 --> 00:39:00.960
and a good partner close by,

361
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:05.880
"success" will be within reach.

362
00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.360
Apart from seeing another step
forward in the house

363
00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:42.119
called the fashion world
in the last year of my own career,

364
00:39:43.329 --> 00:39:47.769
I won't be able to stop watching
over its members growing up.

365
00:39:48.769 --> 00:39:50.480
Don't stop sewing.

366
00:39:50.769 --> 00:39:52.809
Don't be afraid of creating.

367
00:39:53.039 --> 00:39:57.480
Every inch of every kind of fabric
in this world is waiting for you.

368
00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:02.159
(Every inch of every kind of fabric
in this world is waiting for you.)

369
00:40:05.329 --> 00:40:08.159
What's the matter?
You don't look well.

370
00:40:09.199 --> 00:40:11.840
You're the winner today.
Don't forget that.

371
00:40:14.079 --> 00:40:16.880
I'm thinking about
what's going to happen next.

372
00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.440
What's going to happen next?

373
00:40:19.809 --> 00:40:21.000
Easy.

374
00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:24.119
You're still a designer who will
keep designing beautiful clothes.

375
00:40:24.329 --> 00:40:26.400
And I'm the muse who supports you.

376
00:40:27.289 --> 00:40:29.809
Or do you need a new one?

377
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.920
But it might be difficult to find
an awesome prince like me.

378
00:40:35.679 --> 00:40:38.599
What about us?

379
00:40:39.679 --> 00:40:43.039
We'll still be the couple that
everyone envies.

380
00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.880
Are you ready
to be my princess, Rarin?

381
00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.769
What are you talking about?

382
00:40:57.639 --> 00:41:00.679
Didn't we kiss on stage tonight?

383
00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.289
It's going to be big news tomorrow.

384
00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:07.809
The handsome, cool, manly,
and buffed prince

385
00:41:08.769 --> 00:41:12.079
kissed the princess of
the fashion on stage.

386
00:41:16.199 --> 00:41:17.199
Tan,

387
00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.809
I have something to tell you.

388
00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.440
What is it?

389
00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:32.880
Well,

390
00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.329
I don't think it's possible

391
00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.679
between us anymore.

392
00:41:53.719 --> 00:41:55.880
I've made a decision

393
00:41:57.239 --> 00:41:58.880
to leave this place.

394
00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:04.840
What do you mean?

395
00:42:11.679 --> 00:42:13.920
I told you to stop
calling me the prince.

396
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.039
Do you have some time?

397
00:42:18.159 --> 00:42:19.769
I'd like you to listen to my ideas.

398
00:42:21.679 --> 00:42:22.679
Alright.

399
00:42:23.119 --> 00:42:24.639
But just a bit, okay?

400
00:42:26.519 --> 00:42:27.519
Mmm!

401
00:42:29.199 --> 00:42:30.559
Chest, 40.

402
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:33.519
Upper arm, 15.

403
00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.840
Arm length, 16.5

404
00:42:37.159 --> 00:42:38.559
and 28.5.

405
00:42:39.239 --> 00:42:40.639
Wrist, 7.

406
00:42:43.809 --> 00:42:45.519
Shoulder, 18.5.

407
00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:49.480
Front shoulder, 16.5.

408
00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.400
Front length, 17.

409
00:42:54.329 --> 00:42:56.239
Back shoulder, 16.5.

410
00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.440
Back length, 19.

411
00:43:06.079 --> 00:43:08.159
No matter how miraculous
the power is,

412
00:43:08.159 --> 00:43:09.920
don't rely on it too much.

413
00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:16.079
If you know you love him,

414
00:43:16.679 --> 00:43:19.239
just listen to your heart.

415
00:43:20.719 --> 00:43:22.119
Thank you so much, Tan.

416
00:43:22.559 --> 00:43:24.719
You've inspired me again.

417
00:43:31.329 --> 00:43:32.440
I think

418
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.769
when you design clothes,

419
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:38.880
you probably already have
something on your mind.

420
00:43:52.039 --> 00:43:53.960
In the past,

421
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.880
I've always been relying
on the power in the rain.

422
00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.639
And this time as well.

423
00:43:59.159 --> 00:44:01.800
I was very lucky
to have everyone helping.

424
00:44:02.519 --> 00:44:06.119
And I didn't just think about this.

425
00:44:07.079 --> 00:44:08.840
I've been thinking about it
for a while now.

426
00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.119
I want to get out there
and discover who I am.

427
00:44:15.639 --> 00:44:16.800
What are you talking about?

428
00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.320
You've always been
working by yourself.

429
00:44:21.519 --> 00:44:22.920
I'm talking about

430
00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:25.719
my true self.

431
00:44:26.719 --> 00:44:28.960
The one that doesn't need
to wait for the rain.

432
00:44:29.960 --> 00:44:32.239
The one that doesn't need
to rely on others.

433
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:37.480
The one that actually listens
to my heart.

434
00:44:41.119 --> 00:44:44.039
Come on, Rin.
Aren't you overthinking it?

435
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.480
What about your studio?

436
00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.880
I already have a plan for it.

437
00:44:54.199 --> 00:44:55.519
Don't worry.

438
00:45:00.039 --> 00:45:01.199
What about me?

439
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.960
Am I there, among your heartbeat?

440
00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:33.400
What about me?
Am I there, among your heartbeat?

441
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.079
Because of that stupid news,
are you going to just cut me off?

442
00:45:36.079 --> 00:45:37.920
Rung, do you like it here?

443
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:39.199
Take good care of yourself.

444
00:45:39.199 --> 00:45:42.800
You know you won't change Rin's mind
by doing this?
