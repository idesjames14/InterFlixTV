(Episode 16: Questions About Things That Disappear)

3
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.960
When did you come back?

4
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.400
Mr. Lee recently called and asked me to be in charge of a shoot.

5
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.870
Ms. Jang is doing okay.

6
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.539
She's okay.

7
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.979
Are you over her now?

8
00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.280
I tried so hard to avoid her.

9
00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.319
But I saw her by coincidence.

10
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.530
And that was enough...

11
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.729
to make me crumble down again.

12
00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.000
If you miss her, just go see her.

13
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.370
I don't have an excuse to suddenly go up to her and say hello.

14
00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.079
I know it's tormenting to not be able to do something for your woman.

15
00:04:34.239 --> 00:04:36.949
It's hard to see your loved one giving up on something she wants...

16
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.449
just because of you.

17
00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:41.120
But what if...

18
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.889
you're causing the two of you to be miserable...

19
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.060
by thinking of it that way?

20
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.030
It's not that I don't understand what you mean.

21
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.200
But I personally don't think it's right when people say...

22
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.030
they're sacrificing themselves for their significant other.

23
00:04:56.369 --> 00:04:58.169
People just say that because they're not confident enough.

24
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.239
I'm very disappointed in you for behaving like this.

25
00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:04.510

27
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.820
Hey, Ha Ri. Is she in labor now?

Okay, I'll be right there.

29
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.059
Hey, the baby's coming. I need to shoot her giving birth.

30
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:48.950
I'll call you back.

31
00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:50.919
Where's Ji Hye?

32
00:05:51.049 --> 00:05:52.160
She's getting ready for childbirth.

33
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.260
I was asked to step outside for a second.

34
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.629
The doctor said her membranes ruptured prematurely,

35
00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:57.390
but it's been sorted out.

36
00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:58.799
I'm glad.

37
00:05:58.799 --> 00:06:00.330
No filming will be allowed in the delivery room...

38
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.470
since there could be an emergency.

39
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:03.729
You should get it done right now.

40
00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:06.270
Got it.

41
00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.669
She'll soon give birth. You may head inside.

42
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.140

Why isn't he picking up?

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:01.119
She'll go to the delivery room soon. You need to do the shoot right now.

48
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.530
Okay.

coming back faster now.

52
00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:20.840
I'm guessing the baby will come out soon.

there was a lot of bleeding due to uterine atony,

64

make you happy by all means.

132
00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.050

about being the cause...

134
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.790
- of your misery... - I already knew.

138
00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:04.769
Are you still worried?

139
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.340
Is that why you can't come back to me...

You weren't the only one who was devastated.

I wished for the treatment to have been a success too,

144

and I felt like my world had collapsed.

145

Is this your answer then?

146
00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.040
You really haven't changed at all during these past three months.

147
00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:49.180
What do you want from me?

148
00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.090
I'm worried that I'll be your demise.

149
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:00.989
You'll be miserable...

150
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.090
and in pain,

151
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.029
so how can I ask you to let me love you?

152
00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:15.139
You told me never to give up,

153
00:17:17.139 --> 00:17:18.869
but you waved the white flag first.

154
00:18:22.324 --> 00:18:23.794
What if I waited a little longer?

155
00:18:25.693 --> 00:18:27.334
How much more time do you need?

156
00:18:32.363 --> 00:18:33.474
I know...

157
00:18:35.234 --> 00:18:36.373
how pathetic I am.

158
00:18:38.074 --> 00:18:39.443
While we were apart,

159
00:18:40.673 --> 00:18:42.484
it killed me not to be with you.

160
00:18:45.143 --> 00:18:46.254
And even though you're here,

161
00:18:48.383 --> 00:18:50.423
I still can't show you how much I love you.

162
00:18:55.794 --> 00:18:56.994
It's just like you said.

163
00:19:01.393 --> 00:19:02.834
Nothing has changed.

164
00:19:06.034 --> 00:19:07.804
Just like Sang Gon and Ji Hye,

165
00:19:08.873 --> 00:19:10.774
I should be with you...

166
00:19:11.443 --> 00:19:13.113
even when our lives might be at risk.

167
00:19:20.713 --> 00:19:22.113
I told you I loved you.

168
00:19:23.623 --> 00:19:24.883
But I kept feeling apologetic...

169
00:19:25.853 --> 00:19:27.123
and nervous.

170
00:19:29.764 --> 00:19:31.163
I want to stop that now.

171
00:19:36.663 --> 00:19:38.133
Though it may bring misery,

172
00:19:40.403 --> 00:19:42.004
I want to be with you.

173
00:19:48.274 --> 00:19:49.383
Is that okay?

174
00:19:53.554 --> 00:19:55.284
Who says we're going to be miserable?

175
00:19:59.754 --> 00:20:01.294
And why are you so obsessed about being happy?

176
00:20:03.623 --> 00:20:05.423
So what if we're miserable at times?

177
00:20:07.094 --> 00:20:08.893
It's natural to struggle and get hurt.

178
00:20:19.314 --> 00:20:20.713
Even so, I will never change.

179
00:20:43.764 --> 00:20:45.504
I won't change,

180
00:20:51.004 --> 00:20:52.744
so neither will you.

181
00:20:54.044 --> 00:20:55.173
Am I right?

182
00:21:53.334 --> 00:21:54.433
Tell me.

183
00:21:55.173 --> 00:21:57.244
So what's your answer?

184
00:22:00.474 --> 00:22:03.443
I don't care if I have a baby or not.

185
00:22:04.814 --> 00:22:06.784
I don't care if I'm with someone or not.

186
00:22:09.524 --> 00:22:11.524
I just want to be happy on my own.

187
00:22:15.054 --> 00:22:16.294
So now that...

188
00:22:16.764 --> 00:22:19.193
you've decided to love yourself,

189
00:22:19.893 --> 00:22:21.834
are you telling me...

190
00:22:21.834 --> 00:22:24.004
that you don't care whether I stay with you or not?

191
00:22:27.103 --> 00:22:29.544
I don't care if you're competent or not.

192
00:22:30.004 --> 00:22:32.274
I don't care how rich you are.

193
00:22:32.913 --> 00:22:35.413
What matters is that I love you.

194
00:22:36.443 --> 00:22:38.383
And I'm saying I won't ever get swayed.

195
00:22:44.883 --> 00:22:48.224
I will never run away again.

196
00:22:49.724 --> 00:22:53.034
The fact that I'm able to be with you like this...

197
00:22:53.193 --> 00:22:54.534
is enough to make me feel grateful.

198
00:22:55.764 --> 00:22:57.234
There's not much to happiness.

199
00:22:58.103 --> 00:22:59.873
A morning like this is enough to make me happy.

200
00:23:03.074 --> 00:23:04.143
Get some more sleep.

201
00:23:04.744 --> 00:23:07.074
I'll make you breakfast.

202
00:23:28.794 --> 00:23:31.133
What a beautiful world.

203
00:23:31.433 --> 00:23:33.834
This is such a beautiful world.

204
00:23:47.683 --> 00:23:51.183
All men want the same thing. My gosh, seriously.

205
00:24:03.633 --> 00:24:06.234
Why do you look so startled?

206
00:24:11.103 --> 00:24:13.744
I ironed that dress shirt so I could wear it later.

207
00:24:15.643 --> 00:24:17.943
Oh... I see.

208
00:24:18.744 --> 00:24:21.853
I just really wanted to try it on.

209
00:24:26.994 --> 00:24:30.224
Why did she wear my shirt instead of her own clothes?

210
00:24:33.163 --> 00:24:34.294
Do you know something?

211
00:24:35.463 --> 00:24:38.334
The sun rises from the east.

212
00:24:38.433 --> 00:24:39.603
And in my heart...

213
00:24:40.004 --> 00:24:42.133
You're going to say you love me. You really need to stop.

214
00:25:04.724 --> 00:25:06.594
The baby takes after the mother.

215
00:25:09.363 --> 00:25:10.903
You can see that?

216
00:25:15.203 --> 00:25:18.744
Have you given up on having a child?

217
00:25:21.713 --> 00:25:25.584
I guess it'd be nice to have one and hope to get pregnant one day.

218
00:25:26.353 --> 00:25:28.913
But I don't think I'll be sad about not having a child.

219
00:25:30.584 --> 00:25:32.683
We can have fun together.

220
00:25:33.893 --> 00:25:37.324
We'll be fine as long as you stop making dad jokes.

221
00:25:42.863 --> 00:25:44.034
Dad.

222
00:25:44.903 --> 00:25:46.504
Are you in love with me?

223
00:25:47.103 --> 00:25:50.643
If you keep looking at me like that, I can't eat.

224
00:25:50.943 --> 00:25:53.814
And why do you keep making dad jokes...

225
00:25:53.814 --> 00:25:56.984
when we're living in 2020?

226
00:25:57.584 --> 00:25:59.413
You make me feel so embarrassed.

227
00:26:03.984 --> 00:26:06.893
Think of something pure and clean.

228
00:26:08.224 --> 00:26:10.693
I was thinking of something very pure right now.

229
00:26:13.433 --> 00:26:14.463
Eat up.

230
00:26:16.433 --> 00:26:18.534
- It's delicious. - Enjoy your meal.

231
00:26:18.663 --> 00:26:19.673
Okay.

232
00:26:21.203 --> 00:26:23.643
A child could be a miracle for you guys.

233
00:26:24.943 --> 00:26:28.443
I'm sure you both tried your best, but it didn't work out.

234
00:26:29.213 --> 00:26:30.913
So it's fair to say that having a child is a miracle.

235
00:26:32.084 --> 00:26:33.784
If the treatment works,

236
00:26:34.514 --> 00:26:36.484
that means we can try IVF.

237
00:26:37.183 --> 00:26:39.353
That will give us a higher chance of having a baby, right?

238
00:26:39.653 --> 00:26:40.893
Yes, of course.

239
00:26:41.623 --> 00:26:43.594
Are you willing to start the treatment again?

240
00:26:46.663 --> 00:26:50.264
After I made up my mind, I started wanting a baby.

241
00:26:51.933 --> 00:26:54.234
And now, I keep wanting one even more.

242
00:27:08.413 --> 00:27:09.784
How adorable.

243
00:27:11.024 --> 00:27:12.153
You look familiar.

244
00:27:13.324 --> 00:27:14.824
Why are you making my kid cry?

245
00:27:17.294 --> 00:27:18.294
I Sang.

246
00:27:18.724 --> 00:27:19.863
Jae Young.

247
00:27:21.693 --> 00:27:23.564
I didn't leave Ha Ri...

248
00:27:24.264 --> 00:27:26.004
because I had a change of heart.

249
00:27:28.304 --> 00:27:31.373
This might not be the best topic to talk about.

250
00:27:32.974 --> 00:27:34.373
But before I met Ha Ri,

251
00:27:34.814 --> 00:27:37.284
I was with someone for 17 years.

252
00:27:38.613 --> 00:27:41.413
But now, I'm going to love Ha Ri...

253
00:27:42.413 --> 00:27:43.653
even more than that,

254
00:27:45.324 --> 00:27:46.623
and I'll never change.

255
00:27:47.594 --> 00:27:48.953
I never asked.

256
00:27:52.693 --> 00:27:56.163
I just want to get...

257
00:27:56.903 --> 00:27:58.163
your acknowledgment.

258
00:27:59.774 --> 00:28:01.804
I'm no longer going to be...

259
00:28:01.974 --> 00:28:05.203
the annoying guy friend, so you don't need to worry.

260
00:28:06.474 --> 00:28:09.713
But of course, I'm not important enough to make you guys to break up.

261
00:28:13.754 --> 00:28:16.284
You've known each other for so long.

262
00:28:16.524 --> 00:28:18.054
I will never be able to beat that.

263
00:28:19.853 --> 00:28:21.024
But...

264
00:28:22.153 --> 00:28:24.623
can't you come back,

265
00:28:25.524 --> 00:28:26.564
and be her best friend again?

266
00:28:28.433 --> 00:28:30.734
You're a really weird guy.

267
00:28:30.903 --> 00:28:33.433
Are you looking down on me, or are you trying to make fun of me?

268
00:28:33.633 --> 00:28:34.673
What are you doing?

269
00:28:37.544 --> 00:28:40.413
I didn't want to tell you this,

270
00:28:41.814 --> 00:28:44.213
but I like you.

271
00:28:46.554 --> 00:28:47.713
Me?

272
00:28:48.913 --> 00:28:50.123
What about Ha Ri?

273
00:28:53.824 --> 00:28:57.264
I don't think we should be talking about this at a playground.

274
00:28:58.094 --> 00:28:59.094
Who knows?

275
00:28:59.893 --> 00:29:03.103
We could turn out to be good friends.

276
00:29:03.703 --> 00:29:05.234
I doubt it.

277
00:29:05.334 --> 00:29:06.574
I already have many.

278
00:29:07.334 --> 00:29:08.534
But I don't.

279
00:29:16.373 --> 00:29:19.443
- No, it's all right. - Please accept it.

280
00:29:19.443 --> 00:29:20.514
Can you at least let go of my hand?

281
00:29:20.883 --> 00:29:21.953
- Just... - Ms. Lee.

282
00:29:21.953 --> 00:29:23.054
- But... - What's going on?

283
00:29:23.054 --> 00:29:24.683
- Ms. Lee... - Let go of her right now.

284
00:29:25.284 --> 00:29:26.824
Who on earth are you?

285
00:29:27.824 --> 00:29:29.224
Are you selling her something?

286
00:29:29.353 --> 00:29:30.564
Auntie, did he steal from you?

287
00:29:31.393 --> 00:29:32.794
What did you just say?

288
00:29:33.334 --> 00:29:35.663
- And who may you two be? - I'm her son.

289
00:29:35.933 --> 00:29:37.034
And I'm her son-in-law.

290
00:29:39.564 --> 00:29:42.673
There's no need to glare at me like that.

291
00:29:43.703 --> 00:29:47.044
Goodness. It must feel reassuring to have these two.

292
00:29:48.113 --> 00:29:49.244
My gosh.

293
00:29:49.244 --> 00:29:51.883
- Wait a second. - Auntie, stop.

294
00:29:54.153 --> 00:29:55.514
Who on earth is he?

295
00:29:55.913 --> 00:29:59.584
Did he approach you knowing you had money?

296
00:30:00.054 --> 00:30:02.754
You're too beautiful,

297
00:30:02.923 --> 00:30:05.423
and must watch out for creepy men.

298
00:30:05.423 --> 00:30:07.193
Unbelievable!

299
00:30:08.294 --> 00:30:11.603
I haven't had a man ask for my number in decades.

300
00:30:11.703 --> 00:30:13.903
It was my chance to go to Na Hoon A's concert.

301
00:30:14.034 --> 00:30:16.574
What gives you the right to ruin my lucky day!

302
00:30:17.274 --> 00:30:18.544
But you were like,

303
00:30:19.044 --> 00:30:21.673
"No, please don't."

304
00:30:21.774 --> 00:30:24.044
I was playing hard to get, you fool.

305
00:30:24.183 --> 00:30:26.014
I'm sorry, Ms. Lee.

306
00:30:26.014 --> 00:30:28.014
I wasn't trying to ruin your dating life.

307
00:30:29.754 --> 00:30:31.183
Fancy seeing you here though.

308
00:30:33.853 --> 00:30:35.494
Tell me about it.

309
00:30:35.494 --> 00:30:38.663
I can't believe you'd ruin her chances of a date.

310
00:30:39.163 --> 00:30:40.234
Unbelievable.

311
00:30:40.494 --> 00:30:42.433
Anyway, I should get going.

312
00:30:43.133 --> 00:30:44.264
Darn it.

313
00:30:58.044 --> 00:31:00.413
Do you have the list of new companies?

314
00:31:00.554 --> 00:31:01.613
Yes, right here.

315
00:31:02.683 --> 00:31:05.453
Still, wouldn't it be better to focus on the companies...

316
00:31:05.453 --> 00:31:09.224
we have a contract with instead of finding new ones to approach?

317
00:31:09.494 --> 00:31:11.463
There's not enough.

318
00:31:12.594 --> 00:31:14.363
Renewing contracts is hard enough.

319
00:31:14.363 --> 00:31:16.534
The renewal alone won't stop "The Baby" from being canceled.

320
00:31:18.034 --> 00:31:19.564
Shouldn't we at least renew the contracts first...

321
00:31:20.334 --> 00:31:21.633
to fight another day?

322
00:31:22.873 --> 00:31:25.774
Do you not have a fighting spirit or is it your confidence that lacks?

323
00:31:30.314 --> 00:31:31.383
Sorry about that.

324
00:31:32.284 --> 00:31:34.314
I'm just trying to do a good job, that's all.

325
00:31:35.453 --> 00:31:37.824
In the past, I did what I want...

326
00:31:37.824 --> 00:31:39.923
not following the rules or others.

327
00:31:40.494 --> 00:31:42.824
But now that I want to do better,

328
00:31:43.193 --> 00:31:44.824
everything seems like a mess,

329
00:31:45.594 --> 00:31:47.863
and I can't tell if I'm doing a good job.

330
00:31:51.734 --> 00:31:55.474
I've seen improvement in your recent writing.

331
00:31:58.274 --> 00:32:00.913
Well, then. Let's pull an all-nighter,

332
00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:03.314
and think of a way to score more advertisement deals.

333
00:32:04.183 --> 00:32:06.443
I'll head outside and get us a bite to eat.

334
00:32:06.613 --> 00:32:07.683
Sure.

335
00:32:36.844 --> 00:32:38.584
Gosh, I must've dozed off.

336
00:32:45.123 --> 00:32:46.353
Why are you laughing?

337
00:32:47.724 --> 00:32:51.193
I had no idea you could be this adorable.

338
00:32:52.064 --> 00:32:54.963
Are you flirting with me again? Well, I won't fall for it.

339
00:32:55.863 --> 00:32:57.103
You'll need this.

340
00:32:58.004 --> 00:32:59.064
Why?

341
00:33:01.304 --> 00:33:02.574
Like this?

342
00:33:04.744 --> 00:33:05.943
Go ahead and wipe your face.

343
00:33:08.074 --> 00:33:11.183
The chairman and the executives...

344
00:33:13.613 --> 00:33:16.314
are leaning toward the cancellation of "The Baby".

345
00:33:19.623 --> 00:33:22.094
Is it just the paper magazine...

346
00:33:22.653 --> 00:33:24.794
or the online operation as well?

347
00:33:26.064 --> 00:33:29.264
They're talking about ceasing both.

348
00:33:32.133 --> 00:33:33.873
What about our teams then?

349
00:33:35.504 --> 00:33:37.673
Those of the Advertising Department...

350
00:33:37.943 --> 00:33:40.413
can move to another department within the company.

351
00:33:41.373 --> 00:33:42.544
Mr. Kim,

352
00:33:43.213 --> 00:33:45.043
the Management Department has an opening,

353
00:33:45.043 --> 00:33:46.414
so consider the position.

354
00:33:48.313 --> 00:33:51.624
Ms. Jang, we'll make room for you too somewhere,

355
00:33:51.784 --> 00:33:53.854
so wait for the transfer.

356
00:33:56.653 --> 00:33:58.224
Let the journalists know that...

357
00:33:58.224 --> 00:34:00.394
they'll be transferred to the department of their liking.

358
00:34:02.994 --> 00:34:06.003
In other words, we're being kicked out.

359
00:34:07.633 --> 00:34:08.704
I'm sorry...

360
00:34:09.974 --> 00:34:12.874
for not being able to stop this.

361
00:34:24.083 --> 00:34:25.854
I know this is sudden,

362
00:34:27.293 --> 00:34:28.854
but Hyo Joo and So Yoon will have a place...

363
00:34:29.253 --> 00:34:31.193
in the fashion or home decoration department.

364
00:34:31.923 --> 00:34:35.034
Yeon Ho, you're being offered a position as deputy manager...

365
00:34:35.034 --> 00:34:37.934
at the new home decoration department,

366
00:34:38.503 --> 00:34:41.233
so think about it unless you want to move to another company.

367
00:34:42.704 --> 00:34:45.273
What about you though?

368
00:34:47.443 --> 00:34:48.574
I'm still thinking.

369
00:34:55.583 --> 00:34:57.583
Of course I don't want "The Baby" to be canceled...

370
00:34:58.684 --> 00:35:00.894
when I'm the editor-in-chief.

371
00:35:02.293 --> 00:35:04.264
But we've had a good run.

372
00:35:05.164 --> 00:35:06.693
You all did a good job,

373
00:35:08.434 --> 00:35:10.604
so only think about your futures,

374
00:35:11.233 --> 00:35:12.563
and make a wise decision.

375
00:35:16.003 --> 00:35:18.974
So it was all for nothing.

376
00:35:19.574 --> 00:35:23.414
We worked day and night trying to sign new advertisement deals.

377
00:35:23.744 --> 00:35:25.414
Weren't we doing a good job?

378
00:35:26.144 --> 00:35:27.983
How can they decide to cut us like this?

379
00:35:28.313 --> 00:35:30.753
Isn't there anything we can try?

380
00:35:31.224 --> 00:35:33.153
This is upsetting, you know.

381
00:35:33.153 --> 00:35:35.193
You're not the only one who is devoted to "The Baby".

382
00:35:35.624 --> 00:35:37.863
It's also ours too.

383
00:35:39.563 --> 00:35:41.434
It's partially mine as well.

384
00:35:42.963 --> 00:35:45.363
Ms. Jang, let's at least try something.

385
00:35:45.604 --> 00:35:47.804
That way, we can learn one more thing before calling it quits.

386
00:35:52.874 --> 00:35:54.874
I'd like to be clear that it's you guys who insisted this.

387
00:35:57.483 --> 00:35:59.113
Anyway, I'll give a presentation...

388
00:35:59.113 --> 00:36:00.613
objecting to the magazine's cancellation.

389
00:36:02.284 --> 00:36:03.414
Get ready for an all-nighter.

390
00:36:05.854 --> 00:36:07.324
As if that's new to us.

391
00:36:07.324 --> 00:36:09.894
I can't let my skin go bad for nothing.

392
00:36:09.894 --> 00:36:12.363
The cancellation will be revoked no matter what.

393
00:36:12.563 --> 00:36:15.293
Okay. Let's wish us luck.

394
00:36:15.894 --> 00:36:17.733
Save the energy for the presentation.

395
00:36:22.474 --> 00:36:24.374
Is that how it is?

396
00:36:24.704 --> 00:36:25.874
Gosh.

397
00:36:26.104 --> 00:36:27.313
How about just us then?

398
00:36:30.483 --> 00:36:32.983
So Yoon, you're good at making presentation slides, right?

399
00:36:33.443 --> 00:36:35.854
- Yes, hand over the materials. - Sure.

400
00:36:36.684 --> 00:36:39.253
Hyo Joo, do some research on the supporters of our competitors.

401
00:36:39.354 --> 00:36:40.454
Sure.

402
00:36:40.753 --> 00:36:43.354
Ms. Jang, wouldn't it be better with a visual aid?

403
00:36:43.863 --> 00:36:45.023
Can you do it?

404
00:36:45.164 --> 00:36:47.463
- So Yoon and I will give it a shot. - Sure.

405
00:36:54.034 --> 00:36:55.074
(Si Ye from The Mom)

406
00:36:57.204 --> 00:36:59.003
Hi, it's me.

407
00:36:59.604 --> 00:37:01.673
I know it's been so long.

408
00:37:02.273 --> 00:37:03.983
Yes, I'm still with "The Baby".

409
00:37:04.543 --> 00:37:07.684
Actually, I called for a favor.

410
00:37:11.854 --> 00:37:15.324
The studio will have to close if "The Baby" is canceled.

411
00:37:15.624 --> 00:37:17.494
It'll be like digging out my own heart.

412
00:37:18.423 --> 00:37:22.394
Ha Ri will save the day, so don't worry too much.

413
00:37:23.094 --> 00:37:24.304
Then I'll be glad,

414
00:37:25.633 --> 00:37:28.733
but if the magazine is canceled,

415
00:37:28.733 --> 00:37:30.104
I'll be in trouble.

416
00:37:30.344 --> 00:37:32.144
My fixed income will be gone.

417
00:37:32.704 --> 00:37:35.273
It's not like I can find another magazine to work with...

418
00:37:35.273 --> 00:37:36.744
when there is so little left.

419
00:37:37.883 --> 00:37:39.213
Darn it.

420
00:37:43.954 --> 00:37:45.583
I'm done renting out the space too.

421
00:37:47.793 --> 00:37:50.324
When I'm already at a loss?

422
00:37:50.824 --> 00:37:53.264
It's not Ms. Jang I don't trust,

423
00:37:53.264 --> 00:37:54.463
but that company.

424
00:37:54.463 --> 00:37:56.394
You can't take it out on me like this.

425
00:37:56.863 --> 00:37:57.963
Are you kidding me?

426
00:38:03.644 --> 00:38:05.204
I won't pay the rent anymore.

427
00:38:07.974 --> 00:38:09.144
Let's run this place together instead.

428
00:38:11.613 --> 00:38:12.844
Have me as a co-owner.

429
00:38:14.213 --> 00:38:15.313
What?

430
00:38:15.613 --> 00:38:18.184
I should have a decent studio myself anyway.

431
00:38:19.083 --> 00:38:21.094
This is more than enough.

432
00:38:23.253 --> 00:38:24.363
You...

433
00:38:25.563 --> 00:38:28.563
Someone as talented and considerate as you...

434
00:38:28.664 --> 00:38:30.233
should be my co-owner.

435
00:38:30.233 --> 00:38:31.633
It'll be a pleasure, Mr. Han.

436
00:38:39.874 --> 00:38:41.014
Are you all ready?

437
00:38:41.574 --> 00:38:42.744
- Sure. - Of course.

438
00:38:43.813 --> 00:38:44.914
Let's go then.

439
00:39:05.186 --> 00:39:07.155
Thank you for attending today.

440
00:39:07.586 --> 00:39:10.215
We asked you to join us today,

441
00:39:10.555 --> 00:39:13.186
so we could explain how competitive "The Baby" is.

442
00:39:13.856 --> 00:39:15.755
Please take a look at the screen.

443
00:39:19.896 --> 00:39:22.396
These are popular videos that got a lot of views.

444
00:39:22.836 --> 00:39:26.035
Lots of comments said they started reading our magazine...

445
00:39:26.706 --> 00:39:29.206
after they saw these videos in order to learn more.

446
00:39:29.936 --> 00:39:31.175
It may seem like online contents...

447
00:39:31.175 --> 00:39:33.206
lead the viewers to subscribe our magazine.

448
00:39:33.876 --> 00:39:37.115
But it also shows that magazines have more contents and stories,

449
00:39:37.115 --> 00:39:39.985
and therefore should remain as our main business.

450
00:39:40.146 --> 00:39:43.115
But compared to the increase of the views we get online,

451
00:39:43.285 --> 00:39:45.555
our magazine subscription rate keeps falling.

452
00:39:47.055 --> 00:39:48.095
That's...

453
00:39:48.626 --> 00:39:50.296
As you already know,

454
00:39:50.595 --> 00:39:52.595
we have a fixed target audience,

455
00:39:52.796 --> 00:39:54.796
so it's not easy to expand our pool of subscribers.

456
00:39:56.666 --> 00:39:57.766
Keep going.

457
00:40:00.936 --> 00:40:03.436
Compared to our competitor,

458
00:40:03.505 --> 00:40:05.945
we have twice as many supporters as they have.

459
00:40:06.345 --> 00:40:09.376
These people are power bloggers,

460
00:40:09.376 --> 00:40:10.885
social media influencers,

461
00:40:10.885 --> 00:40:13.816
and our loyal subscribers.

462
00:40:14.686 --> 00:40:16.055
The fact that we've had...

463
00:40:16.555 --> 00:40:19.626
loyal subscribers for 10 years...

464
00:40:19.785 --> 00:40:21.695
means we have a strong root...

465
00:40:21.825 --> 00:40:25.166
and capacity to maintain our magazine brand for the future.

466
00:40:25.796 --> 00:40:28.796
The viral marketing we carried out with The Mom was very effective.

467
00:40:28.796 --> 00:40:30.805
Our clients freaking...

468
00:40:31.635 --> 00:40:32.865
They very much loved it.

469
00:40:36.706 --> 00:40:37.976
I always put...

470
00:40:38.445 --> 00:40:40.715
our subscribers first.

471
00:40:41.376 --> 00:40:44.546
But the small number of supporters can't be a good enough reason...

472
00:40:44.546 --> 00:40:47.115
to maintain the magazine.

473
00:40:50.316 --> 00:40:52.126
There's no way to make money.

474
00:40:53.325 --> 00:40:54.755
We'll make company newsletters for other companies...

475
00:40:55.095 --> 00:40:56.655
and promote products using our magazine.

476
00:40:57.195 --> 00:41:00.396
We'll use our knowledge regarding publishing and advertisement...

477
00:41:00.396 --> 00:41:03.166
and do our best to carry out additional businesses.

478
00:41:06.035 --> 00:41:08.305
I understand what you mean.

479
00:41:09.976 --> 00:41:11.345
But I think it's time we stop.

480
00:41:13.505 --> 00:41:17.285
I know very well how hard you all worked...

481
00:41:17.985 --> 00:41:19.816
to increase our sales.

482
00:41:20.316 --> 00:41:22.586
I'm not blaming you for anything.

483
00:41:23.186 --> 00:41:24.586
I'm just saying...

484
00:41:24.825 --> 00:41:27.255
it's no longer possible for us to make money.

485
00:41:28.026 --> 00:41:29.555
That's our reality.

486
00:41:31.396 --> 00:41:34.766
I also don't want to cancel the magazine...

487
00:41:35.166 --> 00:41:36.766
that I created.

488
00:41:41.135 --> 00:41:42.376
I think...

489
00:41:43.106 --> 00:41:45.405
I've heard enough.

490
00:41:46.976 --> 00:41:48.115
Ms. Jang.

491
00:41:50.615 --> 00:41:53.445
Thank you for working so hard until now.

492
00:41:55.316 --> 00:41:57.626
Then for the very last time,

493
00:41:58.356 --> 00:42:00.896
can you please take a look at this?

494
00:42:04.066 --> 00:42:05.095
Sir.

495
00:42:17.445 --> 00:42:19.476
Every time my son got sick,

496
00:42:19.575 --> 00:42:21.546
I looked into "The Baby".

497
00:42:22.376 --> 00:42:25.215
I know I could search online, but it's become a habit.

498
00:42:25.945 --> 00:42:29.086
Every time I felt lost, I could rely on "The Baby".

499
00:42:29.885 --> 00:42:32.626
I called the reporters to complain so many times,

500
00:42:33.526 --> 00:42:35.126
and I also asked them for advice.

501
00:42:36.296 --> 00:42:37.925
I was really stressed due to childcare,

502
00:42:37.925 --> 00:42:39.325
but they helped me relieve my stress.

503
00:42:40.126 --> 00:42:41.566
I had so much fun...

504
00:42:42.135 --> 00:42:43.595
when I wrote postcards for the magazine...

505
00:42:43.595 --> 00:42:45.066
after I put my baby to bed.

506
00:42:45.635 --> 00:42:48.206
But of course, my purpose was to get a prize.

507
00:42:49.276 --> 00:42:52.706
I collected every one of your magazine for two years.

508
00:42:54.175 --> 00:42:57.916
I really don't want "The Baby" to disappear.

509
00:42:58.016 --> 00:43:00.445
I had my first shoot when I was five with Aunt Ha Ri.

510
00:43:00.885 --> 00:43:03.356
I've been working as a model ever since.

511
00:43:03.885 --> 00:43:06.755
And now, I'm a university student. My dream is to become an actor.

512
00:43:07.086 --> 00:43:09.496
To some people, it might just be a magazine.

513
00:43:09.925 --> 00:43:12.095
But to me, it was where I took my first step to achieve my dream.

514
00:43:28.115 --> 00:43:29.416
This is a business,

515
00:43:30.586 --> 00:43:32.586
so I know we need to make profit.

516
00:43:34.655 --> 00:43:36.285
But I personally think...

517
00:43:37.626 --> 00:43:40.356
we can't put a price on our magazine.

518
00:43:41.055 --> 00:43:43.496
It's worth so much more than that,

519
00:43:45.095 --> 00:43:46.166
and it's very meaningful.

520
00:43:47.535 --> 00:43:49.095
If you give us a chance,

521
00:43:50.535 --> 00:43:52.365
we will turn this into a valuable magazine...

522
00:43:54.305 --> 00:43:57.206
since we know how much our magazine is worth.

523
00:44:10.686 --> 00:44:12.785
That was great. You may leave now.

524
00:44:28.276 --> 00:44:29.376
Sir.

525
00:44:41.586 --> 00:44:44.526
Let's discuss what we should do.

526
00:45:49.115 --> 00:45:50.485
Haven't you heard anything yet?

527
00:46:20.785 --> 00:46:23.916
The executives were very resolute.

528
00:46:28.296 --> 00:46:30.695
But we decided to keep...

529
00:46:30.695 --> 00:46:32.425
our online business.

530
00:46:37.365 --> 00:46:38.505
You guys can focus on...

531
00:46:38.505 --> 00:46:41.005
getting advertisements for our online platform now.

532
00:46:52.016 --> 00:46:53.385
Do your best...

533
00:46:55.516 --> 00:46:57.016
on the last edition to wrap up nicely.

534
00:47:00.155 --> 00:47:01.255
Okay.

535
00:47:54.615 --> 00:47:58.485
(Shim Jung Hwa)

536
00:48:04.655 --> 00:48:05.755
Jung Hwa,

537
00:48:08.856 --> 00:48:10.155
can you buy me a drink?

538
00:48:13.825 --> 00:48:16.296
Hold on just a second.

539
00:48:37.856 --> 00:48:38.925
Come here.

540
00:48:48.635 --> 00:48:49.796
You did well.

541
00:48:51.465 --> 00:48:52.566
You did a good job.

542
00:49:03.146 --> 00:49:05.485
I have a deadline to meet. I'm almost done.

543
00:49:06.246 --> 00:49:09.155
You seem busier than you were back at "The Baby".

544
00:49:09.316 --> 00:49:10.555
Working at home means...

545
00:49:10.555 --> 00:49:12.385
that I have to work while babysitting.

546
00:49:12.856 --> 00:49:15.425
"And getting attention was the goal all along."

547
00:49:19.296 --> 00:49:20.396
Done.

548
00:49:21.595 --> 00:49:23.796
My gosh. Girls, you're here.

549
00:49:27.135 --> 00:49:29.535
What's with those uneasy gazes?

550
00:49:30.945 --> 00:49:33.706
It's our first time seeing you in your natural state.

551
00:49:35.345 --> 00:49:36.516
Leave if you can't stand it.

552
00:49:36.675 --> 00:49:39.016
That's not it, Ms. Shim.

553
00:49:39.715 --> 00:49:42.385
You're too beautiful, that's all.

554
00:49:43.356 --> 00:49:46.655
We might make a scene today.

555
00:49:46.885 --> 00:49:48.255
Are you sure you can handle it?

556
00:49:49.155 --> 00:49:50.896
It's why I chose this place.

557
00:49:51.796 --> 00:49:54.465
Girls, set the table.

558
00:49:54.766 --> 00:49:56.465
- Sure. - Yes, ma'am.

559
00:49:57.836 --> 00:49:59.635
I'm blinded by your beauty!

560
00:50:00.135 --> 00:50:02.075
- Cheers. - Cheers.

561
00:50:08.516 --> 00:50:10.175
We knew it wouldn't last.

562
00:50:10.345 --> 00:50:12.686
I felt like driving toward a dead end too.

563
00:50:16.016 --> 00:50:17.485
I often thought...

564
00:50:18.255 --> 00:50:20.285
that was I holding onto something...

565
00:50:20.555 --> 00:50:22.255
that wouldn't last too.

566
00:50:23.526 --> 00:50:26.896
Still, I didn't want to be in charge while the ship sank.

567
00:50:27.735 --> 00:50:28.996
I understand that too.

568
00:50:30.266 --> 00:50:32.566
So where will you all go from here?

569
00:50:33.336 --> 00:50:36.075
I agreed to be in charge of the online business.

570
00:50:36.476 --> 00:50:37.746
Ms. Jang put in a good word for me.

571
00:50:38.445 --> 00:50:40.646
I haven't built a good enough career...

572
00:50:40.646 --> 00:50:42.046
to move to another company.

573
00:50:42.945 --> 00:50:44.945
I agreed to stay as well.

574
00:50:45.485 --> 00:50:48.686
I'm also considering going to graduate school.

575
00:50:48.985 --> 00:50:51.385
I'll think about it while working at the company.

576
00:50:52.385 --> 00:50:54.155
I'm moving to the fashion department.

577
00:50:54.726 --> 00:50:57.055
My transfer requests were never taken seriously.

578
00:50:57.055 --> 00:50:59.325
It feels iffy to work there now under these circumstances.

579
00:50:59.396 --> 00:51:02.195
They only agreed to take you because of the circumstances.

580
00:51:03.135 --> 00:51:05.735
The people there will be nothing but territorial,

581
00:51:05.735 --> 00:51:07.805
- so don't let them intimidate you. - I won't.

582
00:51:10.135 --> 00:51:11.246
What about you?

583
00:51:13.746 --> 00:51:15.646
I'm drawing a blank.

584
00:51:17.416 --> 00:51:18.785
What am I supposed to do with my life?

585
00:51:20.985 --> 00:51:22.755
Don't you know that life is a marathon?

586
00:51:23.285 --> 00:51:25.925
Complete one course and another will present itself.

587
00:51:26.126 --> 00:51:29.226
Look at me, for instance. Freelancing isn't so bad.

588
00:51:30.095 --> 00:51:31.896
Only the paycheck is.

589
00:51:34.026 --> 00:51:36.865
You seem to be following the right path,

590
00:51:37.865 --> 00:51:41.606
but why does it feel like I'm always taking the hardest route?

591
00:51:44.606 --> 00:51:47.405
The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.

592
00:51:48.376 --> 00:51:51.046
It's the same for everyone though. We all need...

593
00:51:51.485 --> 00:51:53.916
to crawl our way on the path we chose.

594
00:51:58.325 --> 00:52:00.425
At this moment though,

595
00:52:02.155 --> 00:52:04.356
don't think that the cancellation of "The Baby" was your fault.

596
00:52:06.595 --> 00:52:08.896
It had nothing to do with your performances.

597
00:52:10.195 --> 00:52:12.305
Blame the darn company instead!

598
00:52:13.266 --> 00:52:14.776
- You're right. - Here, here.

599
00:52:14.776 --> 00:52:16.476
Goodness.

600
00:52:17.675 --> 00:52:19.776
Sorry about that. Gosh.

601
00:53:46.965 --> 00:53:48.166
"Goodbye."

602
00:53:49.635 --> 00:53:50.936
"Be well."

603
00:53:51.865 --> 00:53:52.965
"I love you."

604
00:53:55.436 --> 00:53:58.706
How should one say the last goodbye?

605
00:54:05.345 --> 00:54:08.186
Unfortunately, "The Baby"...

606
00:54:08.856 --> 00:54:11.925
is closing its doors that opened 30 years ago.

607
00:54:14.186 --> 00:54:17.595
Paper magazines must be one of the things...

608
00:54:17.595 --> 00:54:18.925
that are pushed out by digital life.

609
00:54:21.496 --> 00:54:25.235
I promised you that I'd find an answer with you all,

610
00:54:26.635 --> 00:54:28.305
but I won't be able to keep what I said.

611
00:54:30.276 --> 00:54:32.706
I'm still unmarried...

612
00:54:33.276 --> 00:54:34.476
and without children.

613
00:54:35.445 --> 00:54:37.675
However, I now have...

614
00:54:37.675 --> 00:54:39.945
someone I truly love.

615
00:54:41.356 --> 00:54:43.755
My boyfriend was against having children at first,

616
00:54:44.356 --> 00:54:47.255
but he's been collecting baby shoes in secret.

617
00:54:49.595 --> 00:54:51.095
What could've gotten into him?

618
00:54:54.425 --> 00:54:56.566
My friend who took a deep dive...

619
00:54:56.896 --> 00:54:58.706
from his successful life...

620
00:54:59.436 --> 00:55:02.905
is now back on his feet and finding his way again.

621
00:55:03.005 --> 00:55:06.046
Hyuk Joon, didn't I tell you not to be back here?

622
00:55:06.046 --> 00:55:07.075
Did you get sick again?

623
00:55:07.476 --> 00:55:09.876
Here. Let me hear what's up.

624
00:55:13.046 --> 00:55:14.885
My other friend who had to put her career on hold...

625
00:55:14.885 --> 00:55:16.316
to raise her children...

626
00:55:16.655 --> 00:55:18.255
never gave up...

627
00:55:18.526 --> 00:55:21.496
and is knocking the high doors of the job market again.

628
00:55:24.396 --> 00:55:26.796
We may seem like we haven't achieved anything,

629
00:55:27.226 --> 00:55:30.496
but we've been taking small steps forward all this time.

630
00:55:30.865 --> 00:55:31.936
How about a smile?

631
00:55:32.365 --> 00:55:33.936
Now there's that handsome face.

632
00:55:35.206 --> 00:55:37.276
As if 30 years had been a mirage,

633
00:55:37.735 --> 00:55:40.005
"The Baby" vanished into the darkness,

634
00:55:40.805 --> 00:55:43.876
but the magazine and our time spent on it...

635
00:55:43.876 --> 00:55:45.146
I look forward to working with you.

636
00:55:45.146 --> 00:55:48.055
It will definitely mean something to us in the long run.

637
00:55:48.516 --> 00:55:49.916
Yes, that's right.

638
00:55:49.916 --> 00:55:52.385
Of course, there's no need to worry.

639
00:55:54.425 --> 00:55:56.026
Sure, don't worry.

640
00:55:57.626 --> 00:55:58.726
Sorry?

641
00:56:01.336 --> 00:56:02.965
Here I am close to reaching 40,

642
00:56:03.766 --> 00:56:05.735
but I still wish to become someone...

643
00:56:06.266 --> 00:56:07.606
and is curious of what tomorrow holds.

644
00:56:09.235 --> 00:56:10.836
Instead of saying my last goodbye,

645
00:56:10.936 --> 00:56:13.206
I will be curious of your tomorrow.

646
00:56:14.546 --> 00:56:15.746
Tomorrow,

647
00:56:16.175 --> 00:56:18.945
we will probably face a different question and a quest,

648
00:56:19.945 --> 00:56:22.485
and I hope that you'll find...

649
00:56:22.856 --> 00:56:24.356
your own answers.

650
00:56:48.746 --> 00:56:51.416
(Congratulations on your 40th birthday.)

651
00:56:54.345 --> 00:56:56.215
Am I already 40?

652
00:57:00.186 --> 00:57:02.055
I can't believe it. I'm 40.

653
00:57:04.496 --> 00:57:06.425
- Hello. - Good morning.

654
00:57:07.666 --> 00:57:10.465
Do you always spend your weekends alone...

655
00:57:10.766 --> 00:57:12.066
with Do Ah?

656
00:57:13.635 --> 00:57:16.505
If it's too much of a hassle for you,

657
00:57:16.505 --> 00:57:18.405
I could always help out.

658
00:57:19.445 --> 00:57:20.505
Sorry?

659
00:57:22.115 --> 00:57:23.276
Oh...

660
00:57:24.516 --> 00:57:28.086
Do Ah and I like spending time alone, you see.

661
00:57:31.385 --> 00:57:34.086
I'm grateful for your offer,

662
00:57:34.485 --> 00:57:37.396
but I'd like to spend my weekends with the person I love.

663
00:57:39.425 --> 00:57:42.465
Goodness. I'm sorry. I didn't know you were seeing someone.

664
00:57:43.896 --> 00:57:45.735
It's someone you know.

665
00:57:46.805 --> 00:57:47.905
Sorry?

666
00:57:49.035 --> 00:57:50.135
My Do ah.

667
00:57:51.606 --> 00:57:52.905
Oh, I see.

668
00:57:54.005 --> 00:57:55.075
Right.

669
00:57:55.546 --> 00:57:58.646
Do Ah, don't fight with your friends and have fun.

670
00:57:59.385 --> 00:58:00.785
- Thank you in advance. - No problem.

671
00:58:00.885 --> 00:58:01.916
Oh, here.

672
00:58:17.166 --> 00:58:20.005
(About the writer: A responsible pediatrician in Hangang-dong...)

673
00:58:26.646 --> 00:58:29.445
(Title: You're walking already?)

674
00:58:35.416 --> 00:58:36.816
- Hey, you're here. - Good morning.

675
00:58:39.555 --> 00:58:42.425
(Title: You're walking already?)

676
00:58:42.456 --> 00:58:45.296
Jae Young must be busy writing all day instead of working.

677
00:58:45.365 --> 00:58:48.195
Now that he has the most subscribers,

678
00:58:48.195 --> 00:58:49.635
he wants to publish a book.

679
00:58:50.996 --> 00:58:53.766
We have so many subscribers now, so someone might beat him this time.

680
00:58:57.075 --> 00:58:59.575
Ms. Jang, let's hire some people.

681
00:59:00.276 --> 00:59:02.345
Ms. Kim, we can't afford to pay anyone.

682
00:59:03.175 --> 00:59:06.646
Ms. Jang, we need to hire people and be more aggressive...

683
00:59:06.646 --> 00:59:07.916
in order to make profit.

684
00:59:08.485 --> 00:59:10.715
We need a web designer...

685
00:59:10.715 --> 00:59:12.526
and a person in charge of the advertisements.

686
00:59:12.925 --> 00:59:16.356
Happy birthday to you

687
00:59:16.356 --> 00:59:18.396
Ms. Jang, happy birthday.

688
00:59:18.595 --> 00:59:20.226
Eu Ddeum, thank you.

689
00:59:21.896 --> 00:59:24.836
She's Kim Eun Young, the director of "Oh My Baby".

690
00:59:25.035 --> 00:59:26.936
And he's Choi Kang Eu Ddeum...

691
00:59:26.936 --> 00:59:28.276
from the Advertising Department of "The Baby".

692
00:59:28.635 --> 00:59:30.706
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

693
00:59:31.075 --> 00:59:32.845
"The Advertising Department"?

694
00:59:35.746 --> 00:59:37.916
Have a seat.

695
00:59:38.175 --> 00:59:39.885
How long have you been working there?

696
00:59:40.385 --> 00:59:41.586
It's been a year.

697
00:59:42.755 --> 00:59:46.155
That means you know your job, but your salary isn't that high yet.

698
00:59:46.655 --> 00:59:48.226
He's just the right person.

699
00:59:48.526 --> 00:59:51.996
You're pretty good at your job now, right?

700
00:59:53.496 --> 00:59:56.896
What do you look for in a company?

701
00:59:58.936 --> 01:00:01.066
I consider the company's vision...

702
01:00:01.206 --> 01:00:04.436
and whether or not I'm able to have fun there.

703
01:00:04.535 --> 01:00:06.575
Our company is one of the best start-up companies...

704
01:00:06.575 --> 01:00:09.016
with an extremely great vision for the future.

705
01:00:09.075 --> 01:00:12.885
Yes, of course. And aren't I really funny?

706
01:00:12.885 --> 01:00:15.686
I can't work because you always make me laugh.

707
01:00:18.885 --> 01:00:20.856
Are you trying to hire me?

708
01:00:22.695 --> 01:00:24.626
Bravo. He's even quick-witted.

709
01:00:24.626 --> 01:00:27.066
He has a bright future ahead of him. Hey, Eu Ddeum.

710
01:00:27.925 --> 01:00:28.996
You trust me, right?

711
01:00:30.496 --> 01:00:33.166
I need time to think about it.

712
01:00:35.206 --> 01:00:38.075
I'm not as naive as I used to be.

713
01:00:39.476 --> 01:00:41.845
You can think about it here. Have some cake.

714
01:00:41.845 --> 01:00:44.715
- That's a great idea. - What are you doing? Hurry.

715
01:00:44.715 --> 01:00:46.416
- No, I need to get going. - What are you talking about?

716
01:00:46.416 --> 01:00:48.086
You should have some cake. You bought it for me.

717
01:00:49.255 --> 01:00:50.816
My gosh, what is this?

718
01:00:50.916 --> 01:00:53.586
I told you to come in the morning so we could celebrate your birthday.

719
01:00:53.586 --> 01:00:55.126
Tonight, I wanted to cook for Jae Young.

720
01:00:55.296 --> 01:00:57.195
What's the big deal? Let's just eat together.

721
01:00:57.325 --> 01:00:59.095
Is it your birthday today? Happy birthday.

722
01:00:59.166 --> 01:01:00.325
Have some meat.

723
01:01:01.226 --> 01:01:02.566
Thanks.

724
01:01:02.666 --> 01:01:03.735
You should eat up.

725
01:01:03.766 --> 01:01:05.206
No, you should eat.

726
01:01:05.206 --> 01:01:08.266
You started a company, so I'm sure you're very busy.

727
01:01:08.905 --> 01:01:10.376
You should eat more than me.

728
01:01:10.706 --> 01:01:12.405
You not only take care of Do Ah and treat patients,

729
01:01:12.405 --> 01:01:14.876
but you even post journals about childcare.

730
01:01:14.876 --> 01:01:16.516
- Yes. - That's enough.

731
01:01:16.516 --> 01:01:17.845
Do you want me to take your spoons away...

732
01:01:17.845 --> 01:01:18.985
and kick you out when you're both 40?

733
01:01:18.985 --> 01:01:20.546
You guys are unbelievable.

734
01:01:20.985 --> 01:01:22.385
- Okay. - Okay.

735
01:01:23.285 --> 01:01:25.155
Are you going to keep living like this?

736
01:01:25.586 --> 01:01:27.425
Are you going to stay single?

737
01:01:27.925 --> 01:01:30.255
At least date someone if you're not going to get married.

738
01:01:30.255 --> 01:01:32.566
You're still so young. Don't waste your youth.

739
01:01:33.796 --> 01:01:35.566
Yes, it's a waste. I know.

740
01:01:36.336 --> 01:01:39.005
Auntie, can you pack me your food?

741
01:01:39.005 --> 01:01:40.436
I want to enjoy it comfortably at home.

742
01:01:40.635 --> 01:01:42.206
Just let us be.

743
01:01:42.405 --> 01:01:45.405
Don't worry about us. You're the one who should start dating.

744
01:01:45.746 --> 01:01:47.646
I feel like you're the one wasting your life away.

745
01:01:47.706 --> 01:01:50.476
- She's right. You should... - I'll take care of myself.

746
01:01:50.476 --> 01:01:51.785
Why aren't you getting married?

747
01:01:53.285 --> 01:01:54.445
Can you also pack me the food?

748
01:01:55.086 --> 01:01:57.086
Really? Then we should all eat separately.

749
01:01:57.086 --> 01:01:59.255
Leave it. Take your hands off. I'm not packing anything.

750
01:01:59.255 --> 01:02:00.825
Why would I do that for you, you ungrateful punks?

751
01:02:00.856 --> 01:02:02.825
- Let me just take this. - Let go of it.

752
01:02:02.825 --> 01:02:04.126
- Let's divide it in half. - Come on.

753
01:02:04.126 --> 01:02:06.195
- Hey, pack this. - Stop it.

754
01:02:06.365 --> 01:02:07.666
- Let me take it home. - No way.

755
01:02:07.666 --> 01:02:09.595
Eat it here. Take your hands off.

756
01:02:09.595 --> 01:02:11.465
- Auntie, let me take it home. - Hey, stop.

757
01:02:13.836 --> 01:02:15.776
- Are you laughing? Let me take it. - Stop it.

758
01:02:20.606 --> 01:02:22.246
- Did Jae Young go home? - Yes.

759
01:02:23.945 --> 01:02:25.016
Where is I Sang?

760
01:02:25.115 --> 01:02:27.445
He went outside the city for a shoot and is coming back late tonight.

761
01:02:28.885 --> 01:02:30.555
Are you really not going to get married?

762
01:02:31.655 --> 01:02:34.356
I like living my life like this. We'll get married when we want to.

763
01:02:37.496 --> 01:02:40.095
Why not live with him after you get married?

764
01:02:42.296 --> 01:02:45.305
Why? Are you worried you guys might break up?

765
01:02:47.166 --> 01:02:49.675
I know we're not going to break up even if we don't get married.

766
01:02:49.976 --> 01:02:51.675
That's why I don't mind not getting married.

767
01:02:54.246 --> 01:02:55.276
Mom.

768
01:02:56.845 --> 01:02:58.316
I'm happy.

769
01:02:59.146 --> 01:03:00.316
I'm very happy.

770
01:03:06.126 --> 01:03:07.856
- I'll be off now. - Okay.

771
01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:10.496
- Call me when you get there. - Okay.

772
01:03:11.126 --> 01:03:13.396
My goodness. Let me carry that.

773
01:03:13.695 --> 01:03:16.296
Here. Go on.

774
01:03:21.135 --> 01:03:22.405
I'm here.

775
01:03:23.876 --> 01:03:25.345
Why are you coming out from there?

776
01:03:26.276 --> 01:03:27.706
Is that a surprise gift for me?

777
01:03:28.175 --> 01:03:29.845
Ta-da. Open it.

778
01:03:33.785 --> 01:03:35.956
My gosh, what is this? It's huge.

779
01:03:38.925 --> 01:03:39.985
I'm going to open it.

780
01:03:49.566 --> 01:03:51.035
- Is this my birthday gift? - Yes.

781
01:03:52.266 --> 01:03:54.735
We need to be healthy and live until we're very old.

782
01:03:57.336 --> 01:03:59.805
Why did you get me so many nutritional supplements?

783
01:04:01.876 --> 01:04:03.175
My hormone levels...

784
01:04:03.546 --> 01:04:06.385
are very close to average, so we should get ready.

785
01:04:07.646 --> 01:04:10.385
I know I'm quite old, but I should dream big.

786
01:04:10.586 --> 01:04:11.925
Let's have 2 sons and 2 daughters.

787
01:04:13.425 --> 01:04:16.296
You're too greedy. That's too much.

788
01:04:17.555 --> 01:04:18.626
It's way too much.

789
01:04:21.996 --> 01:04:23.266
What? What do you want?

790
01:04:23.595 --> 01:04:24.766
I want to sleep with you.

791
01:04:24.965 --> 01:04:28.106
I Sang, I know we live together, but if you keep doing this,

792
01:04:28.106 --> 01:04:31.675
that gives us no reason to sleep in separate rooms.

793
01:04:48.626 --> 01:04:49.626
I refuse to back down.

794
01:04:49.626 --> 01:04:52.266
We promised to respect each other's private lives.

795
01:04:52.396 --> 01:04:55.965
But we also promised that we will no longer be discouraged or miserable.

796
01:04:57.796 --> 01:04:59.735
Ha Ri, wait. You can't do this.

797
01:05:14.845 --> 01:05:15.985
Come in.

798
01:05:23.526 --> 01:05:26.726
In my dream, I was looking at the blue sea.

799
01:05:27.166 --> 01:05:29.535
And suddenly, a rainbow-colored whale popped out...

800
01:05:29.535 --> 01:05:31.235
and started talking to me.

801
01:05:31.496 --> 01:05:32.666
What did it say?

802
01:05:33.635 --> 01:05:35.535
How would I know? It talked to me in its language.

803
01:05:36.505 --> 01:05:37.905
What kind of dream is this?

804
01:05:38.175 --> 01:05:40.106
Do you think it's because I read a lot of fairy tales?

805
01:05:40.206 --> 01:05:42.575
What does it mean when you dream of whales?

806
01:05:42.575 --> 01:05:43.746
Isn't that a conception dream?

807
01:05:44.776 --> 01:05:46.186
Two days ago,

808
01:05:46.316 --> 01:05:48.686
I was in a mysterious paradise,

809
01:05:48.885 --> 01:05:51.316
and there was one golden peach...

810
01:05:51.316 --> 01:05:53.925
on a tree right in front of me,

811
01:05:53.925 --> 01:05:55.526
and I ate it.

812
01:05:56.325 --> 01:05:58.396
That's also a conception dream.

813
01:05:58.865 --> 01:06:00.566
- That's a conception dream. - I know, right?

814
01:06:01.066 --> 01:06:02.796
- I also had a conception dream. - What?

815
01:06:03.035 --> 01:06:05.505
I dreamt of a hareubang. It must've been from abroad.

816
01:06:06.166 --> 01:06:09.836
It had a nose of a foreigner, and I touched it in my dream.

817
01:06:10.376 --> 01:06:11.706
This is surely a conception dream.

818
01:06:12.646 --> 01:06:14.505
Who do you think is pregnant?

819
01:06:15.206 --> 01:06:16.615
It can't be me.

820
01:06:18.445 --> 01:06:20.246
- Am I having a second baby? - Am I having another child?

821
01:06:24.115 --> 01:06:25.356
My goodness, you guys.

822
01:06:25.755 --> 01:06:28.226
I found myself walking in a vast...

823
01:06:28.226 --> 01:06:29.896
and green field.

824
01:06:30.095 --> 01:06:31.896
And from somewhere far away,

825
01:06:32.325 --> 01:06:34.226
I could hear something...

826
01:06:34.226 --> 01:06:36.365
- stomping toward me. - And?

827
01:06:36.836 --> 01:06:38.735
It was a huge golden pig.

828
01:06:39.066 --> 01:06:41.766
And it was running toward me like a rhino.

829
01:06:41.766 --> 01:06:43.976
Did you avoid it? You're not supposed to run.

830
01:06:43.976 --> 01:06:45.976
Of course not. It was a golden pig.

831
01:06:46.675 --> 01:06:49.115
I risked my life and jumped on the pig.

832
01:06:49.115 --> 01:06:51.816
Then I started rolling, and that's when I woke up.

833
01:06:51.915 --> 01:06:53.446
- My goodness. - Ms. Lee.

834
01:06:53.446 --> 01:06:56.055
You need to buy a lottery ticket. You'll win the lottery.

835
01:06:56.055 --> 01:06:58.286
What are you talking about? It's a conception dream.

836
01:06:58.286 --> 01:06:59.356
"A conception dream"?

837
01:07:00.585 --> 01:07:02.425
Right? It's a conception dream, right?

838
01:07:02.795 --> 01:07:05.595
Yes, it's a conception dream. The baby will be rich!

839
01:07:08.665 --> 01:07:10.036
The baby is going to be someone great.

840
01:07:11.766 --> 01:07:13.335
- My goodness. - Congratulations.

841
01:07:13.335 --> 01:07:15.236
- My gosh. - This is great.

842
01:07:26.146 --> 01:07:28.245
Why do I keep dreaming of stuff?

843
01:07:28.715 --> 01:07:31.316
This time, a dragon gave me...

844
01:07:31.316 --> 01:07:33.156
a bunch of magic pearls.

845
01:07:35.226 --> 01:07:36.526
I guess your business is going to do well.

846
01:07:37.455 --> 01:07:40.226
You're right. I guess I'm going to make tons of money.

847
01:07:42.196 --> 01:07:45.705
If you don't want that, I'll have it instead.

848
01:07:46.906 --> 01:07:47.906
Sure.

849
01:07:50.175 --> 01:07:51.236
Are you hungry?

850
01:07:51.875 --> 01:07:54.205
I think I'm about to gain weight. I'm always hungry these days.

851
01:07:55.875 --> 01:07:57.845
It's good to see you eating well.

852
01:08:00.045 --> 01:08:02.415
What should we have for dinner? What would you like?

853
01:08:04.816 --> 01:08:07.255
- Everything. - Everything?

854
01:08:07.986 --> 01:08:09.455
I could eat anything and everything.

855
01:08:12.366 --> 01:08:13.696
Sure, order received.

856
01:08:13.925 --> 01:08:15.095
What are you agreeing to cook?

857
01:08:15.896 --> 01:08:16.995
I don't know,

858
01:08:17.266 --> 01:08:19.906
but I'll cook anything you want.

859
01:08:20.335 --> 01:08:21.766
I'll do anything for you too.

860
01:08:22.875 --> 01:08:25.646
Your wish is my command!

861
01:08:38.555 --> 01:08:43.425
(Thank you for watching Oh My Baby.)

862
01:09:07.146 --> 01:09:10.055
(Stay tuned for the epilogue.)

863
01:09:53.066 --> 01:09:55.635
(Oh My Baby)

864
01:09:59.106 --> 01:10:01.406
Her water broke.

865
01:10:02.135 --> 01:10:04.705
Her water broke!

866
01:10:06.505 --> 01:10:07.745
Which way is it?
