1
00:01:18.344 --> 00:01:19.444
No.

2
00:01:24.454 --> 00:01:25.613
I can't.

3
00:02:03.453 --> 00:02:04.524
I'm...

4
00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:06.793
sorry.

5
00:02:31.483 --> 00:02:33.084
Goodness, you're so excited.

00:02:46.294 --> 00:02:47.364
(Seo Jeong Won)

8
00:03:00.984 --> 00:03:02.014
I'll be...

9
00:03:04.213 --> 00:03:07.383
getting my test result soon.

10
00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:10.283
If I don't get a positive result,

11
00:03:10.753 --> 00:03:12.954
I'll keep trying...

12
00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:16.524
until it works.

13
00:03:20.864 --> 00:03:22.604
But you hate kids.

14
00:03:26.174 --> 00:03:27.943
I tried to hate them...

15
00:03:29.873 --> 00:03:31.713
because I couldn't have them.

16
00:03:40.413 --> 00:03:41.954
From now on,

17
00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:44.894
because it's going to be hard for us to have kids,

18
00:03:46.024 --> 00:03:47.524
we might talk about...

19
00:03:48.264 --> 00:03:50.193
not having kids...

20
00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:54.063
or trying medical procedures after getting married.

21
00:03:57.063 --> 00:03:59.533
We'll be faced with many uncomfortable conversations.

22
00:04:01.644 --> 00:04:03.973
We'll have to talk about things that are painful to talk about...

23
00:04:04.713 --> 00:04:06.713
and that hurt our pride.

24
00:04:07.274 --> 00:04:08.813
We'll want to avoid it.

25
00:04:10.144 --> 00:04:11.614
We might argue.

26
00:04:12.454 --> 00:04:14.054
And one day,

27
00:04:15.324 --> 00:04:17.123
we might want to quit.

28
00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:23.563
- Are you scared? - Yes.

29
00:04:25.234 --> 00:04:27.663
I know you said we should find a way through this.

30
00:04:28.364 --> 00:04:30.133
But there might not be...

31
00:04:31.633 --> 00:04:33.174
a miracle.

32
00:04:34.343 --> 00:04:37.104
You might have to go through the same hurtful experience.

33
00:04:39.014 --> 00:04:40.843
Are you still okay with that?

34
00:04:49.024 --> 00:04:51.693
Even so, let's not give up.

35
00:04:52.654 --> 00:04:54.323
This is an unfair journey...

36
00:04:54.763 --> 00:04:57.563
where the woman is bound to have a harder time...

37
00:04:58.193 --> 00:04:59.393
than the man.

38
00:05:01.063 --> 00:05:04.203
Even if we both lose the fight, you'll end up hurting...

39
00:05:05.674 --> 00:05:07.674
a lot more than me.

40
00:05:10.373 --> 00:05:11.643
So I hope you win.

41
00:05:12.844 --> 00:05:15.183
Because I don't plan on losing either.

42
00:05:32.994 --> 00:05:34.133
We can do this.

43
00:05:39.433 --> 00:05:42.904
(Episode 12: Grown-ups Leave a Place to Go Back to)

44
00:05:56.253 --> 00:05:57.484
Were you about to turn in for the night?

45
00:05:58.554 --> 00:06:01.964
Are you here to brag about your date with Mr. Han?

46
00:06:03.164 --> 00:06:04.734
Is that what you call him?

47
00:06:05.034 --> 00:06:06.333
I call him that too.

48
00:06:07.804 --> 00:06:09.063
What else should I call him?

49
00:06:09.203 --> 00:06:10.364
You called him your son-in-law.

50
00:06:10.633 --> 00:06:12.273
It just popped out.

51
00:06:12.273 --> 00:06:13.873
That wasn't a sign of approval.

52
00:06:15.744 --> 00:06:17.373
He seems like a decent guy,

53
00:06:17.974 --> 00:06:19.714
but don't jump at the chance of marriage...

54
00:06:19.714 --> 00:06:21.643
because you're running out of time.

55
00:06:21.643 --> 00:06:24.484
You're making it sound like I'm a bulldozer.

56
00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:26.914
It takes a long time to know someone's true side,

57
00:06:27.313 --> 00:06:28.924
and marriage doesn't instantly give you an answer.

58
00:06:29.123 --> 00:06:30.284
During the honeymoon phase,

59
00:06:30.383 --> 00:06:32.623
everything about him will seem adorable,

60
00:06:32.724 --> 00:06:34.424
so keep an objective eye.

61
00:06:34.424 --> 00:06:37.623
If something about him is bound to trouble you,

62
00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:39.433
just let him loose.

63
00:06:40.193 --> 00:06:41.304
Got it?

64
00:06:41.933 --> 00:06:43.364
Let him loose?

65
00:06:43.734 --> 00:06:45.104
He's not some tied up dog.

66
00:06:45.234 --> 00:06:47.073
What's with that response?

67
00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:48.904
Is there something wrong with him?

68
00:06:50.544 --> 00:06:51.614
No.

69
00:06:52.614 --> 00:06:53.813
He's not like that.

70
00:06:54.883 --> 00:06:56.784
As if you can be objective.

71
00:06:56.784 --> 00:06:58.183
That's my job to confirm.

72
00:06:58.714 --> 00:07:00.513
You have to get married soon,

73
00:07:00.614 --> 00:07:04.054
so I'll see which one is a better fit for you.

74
00:07:05.494 --> 00:07:06.623
Which one?

75
00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:15.404
It means that I won't let you marry someone unacceptable.

76
00:07:21.304 --> 00:07:24.073
Don't focus too much on the little things...

77
00:07:24.244 --> 00:07:26.044
and try more to be fond of him.

78
00:07:26.943 --> 00:07:28.013
Good night.

79
00:07:49.964 --> 00:07:53.404
- Hello, ma'am. - Goodness. Are you here for Ha Ri?

80
00:07:53.633 --> 00:07:56.143
She heads to work earlier now that she's the editor-in-chief.

81
00:07:56.273 --> 00:07:59.443
Actually, I came by to join you on your workout.

82
00:08:00.044 --> 00:08:01.943
- Me? - Yes.

83
00:08:02.383 --> 00:08:05.154
There's only one thing I want.

84
00:08:05.554 --> 00:08:09.023
All I need from you is to show your unchanging love...

85
00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:10.823
for my Ha Ri.

86
00:08:11.083 --> 00:08:14.094
Out of everything I can offer her, it's what I'm most...

87
00:08:14.453 --> 00:08:15.823
capable of,

88
00:08:16.123 --> 00:08:17.224
so you don't need to worry.

89
00:08:20.364 --> 00:08:23.104
Gosh, this isn't what you think.

90
00:08:23.563 --> 00:08:24.974
He wants to exercise.

91
00:08:25.133 --> 00:08:28.003
My dear Mr. Han wants to join me for my workout.

92
00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.703
Your dear Mr. Han?

93
00:08:31.143 --> 00:08:34.244
My gosh. Is that what I said?

94
00:08:35.284 --> 00:08:38.753
I wonder why. That's not what I meant at all.

95
00:08:39.654 --> 00:08:43.123
Well, I hope you two have a good time.

96
00:08:44.183 --> 00:08:45.294
Let's go.

97
00:08:52.864 --> 00:08:56.133
Auntie, I'm not seeing any patients this morning,

98
00:08:56.364 --> 00:08:59.133
so I'll drop Do Ah off and head to your aerobics class.

99
00:08:59.133 --> 00:09:00.304
Where does it take place?

100
00:09:02.744 --> 00:09:04.943
2 and 3.

101
00:09:05.273 --> 00:09:06.913
Left foot. One.

102
00:09:06.913 --> 00:09:08.814
- 1, 2, 3, 4. - 2.

103
00:09:09.444 --> 00:09:11.883
3 and 4.

104
00:09:12.283 --> 00:09:13.383
Arms!

105
00:09:14.383 --> 00:09:15.454
Two.

106
00:09:15.553 --> 00:09:16.923
- Auntie! - Three.

107
00:09:17.724 --> 00:09:19.653
Four. Left arm.

108
00:09:21.023 --> 00:09:23.423
2 and 3.

109
00:09:24.364 --> 00:09:26.133
Four and arms.

110
00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:33.303
Big movements.

111
00:09:38.773 --> 00:09:41.844
I understand that you're trying to win my heart,

112
00:09:41.913 --> 00:09:44.653
but you're embarrassing me at my place of work.

113
00:09:44.883 --> 00:09:45.984
- I apologize. - Auntie.

114
00:09:47.214 --> 00:09:50.553
Why do you keep talking to him as if he's your son-in-law?

115
00:09:51.153 --> 00:09:54.094
- Is that what I did? - Yes.

116
00:09:54.523 --> 00:09:56.663
You should cut it out already.

117
00:09:56.864 --> 00:10:00.133
Ha Ri and I are in love.

118
00:10:01.303 --> 00:10:03.503
You have no shame, do you?

119
00:10:04.633 --> 00:10:07.434
Don't you see that you're not right for her?

120
00:10:07.633 --> 00:10:10.503
You can throw all the insults you want at me.

121
00:10:11.173 --> 00:10:13.074
I still won't leave Ha Ri.

122
00:10:14.043 --> 00:10:15.584
Gosh, that's so romantic.

123
00:10:16.383 --> 00:10:18.013
Auntie, he's...

124
00:10:20.153 --> 00:10:21.283
He's...

125
00:10:23.454 --> 00:10:24.553
Just forget it.

126
00:10:25.094 --> 00:10:27.594
I hope this makes you realize...

127
00:10:27.824 --> 00:10:31.464
that I'm the most honorable man you'll ever come across.

128
00:10:31.734 --> 00:10:33.033
I disapprove of him.

129
00:10:33.234 --> 00:10:36.064
Is that so? Then keep a close eye on him for me.

130
00:10:36.064 --> 00:10:37.864
He'll be better to Ha Ri because of it.

131
00:10:37.864 --> 00:10:39.273
What am I, some sort of breaking ball?

132
00:10:39.434 --> 00:10:40.704
What's that?

133
00:10:41.543 --> 00:10:42.773
Is that like a dog?

134
00:10:42.773 --> 00:10:44.043
No, that's not...

135
00:10:45.873 --> 00:10:48.214
Anyway, you can't just approve of anyone...

136
00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:50.744
because Ha Ri's clock is ticking.

137
00:10:51.383 --> 00:10:53.314
Let me be honest with you two.

138
00:10:53.814 --> 00:10:56.923
To be frank, neither of you are good enough...

139
00:10:56.923 --> 00:10:58.224
for my daughter.

140
00:11:00.623 --> 00:11:01.994
She only fell for you hard...

141
00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:04.734
because it's hard to meet decent bachelors at her age.

142
00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:07.864
It hasn't been long enough for her to really see your true colors.

143
00:11:09.033 --> 00:11:10.633
Yes, you're right.

144
00:11:10.864 --> 00:11:12.533
You're absolutely right.

145
00:11:12.533 --> 00:11:13.604
Meanwhile,

146
00:11:13.604 --> 00:11:15.043
you don't have anything to offer...

147
00:11:15.043 --> 00:11:16.844
other than the fact that you're a doctor.

148
00:11:16.844 --> 00:11:18.814
I'm only considering you as a candidate...

149
00:11:18.814 --> 00:11:20.744
because we've been like a family for so long.

150
00:11:21.074 --> 00:11:23.643
Are you going to betray me like this?

151
00:11:23.984 --> 00:11:26.413
I have much more to offer, you know.

152
00:11:29.684 --> 00:11:33.594
Must you tell me that you consider him...

153
00:11:34.553 --> 00:11:37.324
as a suitor for your daughter though?

154
00:11:38.393 --> 00:11:39.934
I know it makes me seem like a two-timer,

155
00:11:39.934 --> 00:11:41.434
but your relationship might not last.

156
00:11:41.434 --> 00:11:42.533
That's right.

157
00:11:42.704 --> 00:11:45.003
- Who Ha Ri likes is up to her. - Right.

158
00:11:45.234 --> 00:11:48.803
But I still consider Jae Young as a possible suitor for her.

159
00:11:52.844 --> 00:11:53.913
Auntie...

160
00:11:56.543 --> 00:11:58.753
I don't mind either of you,

161
00:11:59.653 --> 00:12:01.653
so please give me some time.

162
00:12:02.324 --> 00:12:05.354
It's impossible to make a choice right now.

163
00:12:07.354 --> 00:12:08.494
My gosh.

164
00:12:17.864 --> 00:12:18.934
Dr. Yoon,

165
00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:21.903
thank you.

166
00:12:22.873 --> 00:12:24.344
Don't be...

167
00:12:25.074 --> 00:12:26.474
because I haven't given up.

168
00:12:31.854 --> 00:12:32.954
Gosh, this is heavy.

169
00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:35.684
Yeon Ho, what's that?

170
00:12:36.354 --> 00:12:39.253
My mom keeps brewing this pregnancy-boosting herbal tonic.

171
00:12:39.923 --> 00:12:42.064
She's killing me.

172
00:12:42.464 --> 00:12:45.594
It's your mom who's pushing, not your mother-in-law?

173
00:12:45.694 --> 00:12:47.663
I don't get why she feels guilty...

174
00:12:47.663 --> 00:12:49.604
when it's my choice not to have kids.

175
00:12:49.803 --> 00:12:52.834
The hardship of being a DINK couple.

176
00:12:53.234 --> 00:12:54.734
Well, this is a worry for another day.

177
00:12:55.043 --> 00:12:57.074
So are we still up for the workshop?

178
00:12:57.173 --> 00:12:59.744
I submitted the proposal, but it hasn't been approved.

179
00:12:59.944 --> 00:13:01.584
But it's this weekend.

180
00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:04.084
Must the workshop take place on the weekend?

181
00:13:04.513 --> 00:13:06.214
When will we get our rest?

182
00:13:07.253 --> 00:13:09.883
But we need to work on weekdays.

183
00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:11.994
Anyway, I'll ask about it.

184
00:13:12.293 --> 00:13:13.354
Is there anything...

185
00:13:13.354 --> 00:13:14.423
- you need confirmed? - No.

186
00:13:14.893 --> 00:13:17.023
- There's an errand I need to run. - Sure.

187
00:13:17.163 --> 00:13:18.734
- See you later. - See you.

188
00:13:18.734 --> 00:13:19.834
- I won't be gone long. - See you later.

189
00:13:30.173 --> 00:13:31.474
Yes, come in.

190
00:13:36.584 --> 00:13:37.814
What brought you here?

191
00:13:38.584 --> 00:13:40.084
I'm here for a checkup.

192
00:13:41.413 --> 00:13:42.553
And you came to a pediatrician?

193
00:13:46.724 --> 00:13:48.293
Are you really sick?

194
00:13:49.694 --> 00:13:50.763
What is it?

195
00:13:55.964 --> 00:13:58.273
My heart feels like someone's poking at it.

196
00:13:58.974 --> 00:14:00.074
I wonder why.

197
00:14:02.944 --> 00:14:05.714
Is there a heartworm living in it?

198
00:14:09.543 --> 00:14:10.684
I'm here to thank you.

199
00:14:15.883 --> 00:14:18.724
Here I am trying to make a worrisome relationship work,

200
00:14:19.094 --> 00:14:21.594
but you've been by my side...

201
00:14:22.494 --> 00:14:24.494
worrying about me and telling me off at times.

202
00:14:26.334 --> 00:14:28.663
It's a tough job being my friend, right?

203
00:14:31.263 --> 00:14:33.373
Thank you for not telling my mom the truth.

204
00:14:34.834 --> 00:14:36.104
Who knew that...

205
00:14:36.444 --> 00:14:39.344
there would come a day when you thanked me for something.

206
00:14:41.844 --> 00:14:45.283
I never liked him from the get-go though.

207
00:14:48.824 --> 00:14:50.883
Must you take this difficult path?

208
00:14:56.163 --> 00:14:57.263
Jae Young,

209
00:15:01.633 --> 00:15:03.533
I like him a lot.

210
00:15:06.633 --> 00:15:08.373
I don't want to lose him.

211
00:15:10.503 --> 00:15:12.643
I'll do my best to make it work,

212
00:15:13.744 --> 00:15:16.513
so put your worries aside and help me do so.

213
00:15:24.783 --> 00:15:25.923
What's the plan then?

214
00:15:27.393 --> 00:15:28.763
Are you giving up on having kids?

215
00:15:29.564 --> 00:15:31.633
It's been your dream.

216
00:15:32.964 --> 00:15:34.663
Can you give that up?

217
00:15:36.934 --> 00:15:39.173
I may be able to give it up.

218
00:15:42.543 --> 00:15:44.373
We're going to look for a way together.

219
00:15:46.614 --> 00:15:47.714
See you.

220
00:15:47.714 --> 00:15:48.844
Ha Ri.

221
00:15:50.584 --> 00:15:51.913
Put this on.

222
00:15:52.984 --> 00:15:54.153
Why?

223
00:16:01.663 --> 00:16:02.994
How's my heart?

224
00:16:06.334 --> 00:16:08.364
Hey. Why are you so angry?

225
00:16:08.364 --> 00:16:09.903
Your heart is furious.

226
00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:13.104
Yes, I'm angry...

227
00:16:17.003 --> 00:16:18.143
because of you.

228
00:16:55.956 --> 00:16:56.996
How old are you?

229
00:16:57.256 --> 00:16:59.466
- 4 years old. - You're 4 years old?

230
00:16:59.665 --> 00:17:00.996
What's your name?

231
00:17:01.196 --> 00:17:02.796
Lee Ro Eun.

232
00:17:02.796 --> 00:17:04.266
Lee Ro Eun?

233
00:17:05.605 --> 00:17:07.135
You're so pretty.

234
00:17:09.635 --> 00:17:10.976
Lee Ro Eun.

235
00:17:14.905 --> 00:17:15.976
(Thank you for applying the position...)

236
00:17:16.046 --> 00:17:17.276
You punks.

237
00:17:17.276 --> 00:17:19.815
You punks. Take that.

238
00:17:20.786 --> 00:17:23.516
Honey. Should we buy a dishwasher?

239
00:17:25.686 --> 00:17:28.155
It's not that I don't want to do the dishes.

240
00:17:28.186 --> 00:17:29.325
It's tiring for you.

241
00:17:30.256 --> 00:17:31.496
Stop fighting.

242
00:17:33.196 --> 00:17:35.125
Honey. We're out of dish soap.

243
00:17:35.296 --> 00:17:36.796
Wash with baking soda.

244
00:17:37.196 --> 00:17:38.635
Okay.

245
00:17:38.966 --> 00:17:40.165
Hold on.

246
00:17:41.135 --> 00:17:42.206
Here it is.

247
00:18:04.496 --> 00:18:07.266
Honey. Honey, where are you going?

248
00:18:07.395 --> 00:18:09.796
Honey.

249
00:18:17.206 --> 00:18:18.706
Did you come here after running away from home?

250
00:18:22.615 --> 00:18:23.776
What's up?

251
00:18:24.845 --> 00:18:27.845
I heard Hyun Suk cooked, watched the kids, and cleaned,

252
00:18:28.016 --> 00:18:29.055
but you just left.

253
00:18:31.655 --> 00:18:32.825
Look.

254
00:18:33.855 --> 00:18:36.026
Her dark circles are darker than her makeup,

255
00:18:36.026 --> 00:18:38.625
and her eyes are bloodshot as she works.

256
00:18:38.966 --> 00:18:40.526
Isn't that so dreamy?

257
00:18:42.466 --> 00:18:43.736
What happened?

258
00:18:44.196 --> 00:18:46.135
What stupid company...

259
00:18:46.135 --> 00:18:48.605
failed to appreciate the mighty Kim Eun Young,

260
00:18:48.736 --> 00:18:51.375
who will advance our nation's IT industry?

261
00:18:51.635 --> 00:18:53.676
I mailed out 50 resumes,

262
00:18:54.276 --> 00:18:55.946
but they won't hire me even as a clerk.

263
00:18:56.845 --> 00:18:59.546
How could one blank line in my resume...

264
00:18:59.815 --> 00:19:02.186
delete all of my experience?

265
00:19:04.286 --> 00:19:05.325
What about you?

266
00:19:06.355 --> 00:19:07.486
Are you okay?

267
00:19:09.426 --> 00:19:12.026
I can't stop thinking about having kids,

268
00:19:13.766 --> 00:19:14.926
but I'm still happy.

269
00:19:16.835 --> 00:19:18.365
I'm jealous of you for some reason.

270
00:19:19.706 --> 00:19:21.266
I know it's a big deal,

271
00:19:21.266 --> 00:19:24.276
but don't try to make a decision right now and just date him.

272
00:19:24.575 --> 00:19:25.905
It'll work out.

273
00:19:27.145 --> 00:19:28.345
Thanks.

274
00:19:29.415 --> 00:19:30.815
It'll work out for you too.

275
00:19:38.825 --> 00:19:40.325
I don't want to live like this.

276
00:19:43.256 --> 00:19:45.196
But I think I'll have to.

277
00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:48.736
How do you know that?

278
00:19:48.895 --> 00:19:51.865
I don't even know what I'll have for breakfast tomorrow.

279
00:19:53.165 --> 00:19:56.176
I do. I'll eat the kids' leftovers.

280
00:19:57.835 --> 00:20:00.805
No. You'll eat what I make,

281
00:20:00.805 --> 00:20:02.216
whatever that may be.

282
00:20:04.746 --> 00:20:05.845
Get up.

283
00:20:06.186 --> 00:20:08.956
I told Hyun Suk you're staying with me tonight.

284
00:20:09.115 --> 00:20:10.115
Let's go.

285
00:20:14.786 --> 00:20:15.996
Where are you?

286
00:20:16.595 --> 00:20:19.026
You didn't come to the studio.

287
00:20:19.026 --> 00:20:20.165
Is something wrong?

288
00:20:20.365 --> 00:20:22.895
I'm working on something very important right now.

289
00:20:23.095 --> 00:20:24.266
What?

290
00:20:31.135 --> 00:20:32.946
I'm building my future.

291
00:20:37.345 --> 00:20:39.486
- Soo Chul? - Yes?

292
00:20:40.246 --> 00:20:41.315
Oh my gosh.

293
00:20:44.456 --> 00:20:45.986
What are you doing here?

294
00:20:48.186 --> 00:20:49.355
Important work.

295
00:20:53.825 --> 00:20:54.895
Yeon Ho.

296
00:20:55.496 --> 00:20:57.095
What are you doing here?

297
00:20:59.266 --> 00:21:00.565
Are you fully booked?

298
00:21:01.565 --> 00:21:03.605
Can I stay over tonight too?

299
00:21:03.605 --> 00:21:06.276
Is tonight free wives' night?

300
00:21:06.676 --> 00:21:07.946
Have you two met before?

301
00:21:08.345 --> 00:21:10.145
This is my friend Kim Eun Young.

302
00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:12.016
This is my colleague, Park Yeon Ho.

303
00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:16.655
Runaway wives, come in.

304
00:21:24.226 --> 00:21:26.466
- Is that cheese? - Yes.

305
00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:30.236
Here.

306
00:21:31.895 --> 00:21:32.966
Try it.

307
00:21:35.476 --> 00:21:37.875
This place is very busy.

308
00:21:38.536 --> 00:21:42.315
I thought it may be a good side job, so I'm doing an internship.

309
00:21:48.645 --> 00:21:50.256
Do you have the money to open a store?

310
00:21:51.016 --> 00:21:52.426
I'll get a loan.

311
00:21:52.426 --> 00:21:54.686
The studio isn't enough. I'm too nervous.

312
00:21:57.496 --> 00:21:59.565
What? Did you two make up?

313
00:21:59.996 --> 00:22:01.865
Did Ms. Jang say it's okay?

314
00:22:05.835 --> 00:22:09.436
It may be even harder than it is now,

315
00:22:10.405 --> 00:22:12.905
but thankfully, she held onto me.

316
00:22:14.446 --> 00:22:17.176
We'll have to think positive and try.

317
00:22:19.246 --> 00:22:23.216
But do you want kids too?

318
00:22:23.986 --> 00:22:25.855
You said there'll be no kids in your future.

319
00:22:27.286 --> 00:22:28.956
Ha Ri wants them,

320
00:22:30.055 --> 00:22:32.095
so I want to share her dream.

321
00:22:33.825 --> 00:22:37.395
A dream about me wanting to become a dad.

322
00:22:43.575 --> 00:22:44.905
Soo Chul.

323
00:22:46.446 --> 00:22:50.145
Is there a certain state of mind that you must have...

324
00:22:50.145 --> 00:22:52.315
before you become a dad?

325
00:22:53.286 --> 00:22:55.315
You won't know until the baby is born.

326
00:22:55.516 --> 00:22:57.315
I absolutely had no idea.

327
00:22:57.315 --> 00:22:59.355
Who knew I'd be such a fool for my daughter,

328
00:22:59.355 --> 00:23:02.655
that I'd be working so hard to pay for my daughter's lessons?

329
00:23:02.825 --> 00:23:04.696
You just go with it!

330
00:23:06.625 --> 00:23:08.595
You just go with it.

331
00:23:08.625 --> 00:23:10.595
- Should I just go? - You just eat it.

332
00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:12.036
Eat.

333
00:23:13.936 --> 00:23:15.436
Sure. Let's go.

334
00:23:15.536 --> 00:23:18.135
- Wait. Isn't this chicken feet? - Yes.

335
00:23:20.506 --> 00:23:21.905
Isn't it good?

336
00:23:23.246 --> 00:23:25.986
I can't eat chicken feet, but this tastes good.

337
00:23:26.486 --> 00:23:28.246
- Isn't it? Enjoy. - Yes.

338
00:23:29.615 --> 00:23:31.216
It's really chewy.

339
00:23:37.796 --> 00:23:41.065
My mom was being considerate and sent us herbal tonic...

340
00:23:41.065 --> 00:23:43.665
to help us get pregnant.

341
00:23:44.095 --> 00:23:46.036
But he says he doesn't want them.

342
00:23:46.506 --> 00:23:49.575
I mean, just don't take them then. Don't badmouth my mom.

343
00:23:50.905 --> 00:23:53.575
Raising kids is 100 times harder than working.

344
00:23:54.145 --> 00:23:56.016
I increased stamina from raising my kids...

345
00:23:56.246 --> 00:23:57.446
and improved on my patience.

346
00:23:57.746 --> 00:24:00.746
So shouldn't that count as experience?

347
00:24:01.016 --> 00:24:02.085
Drink some water.

348
00:24:08.686 --> 00:24:10.296
- I'm okay now. - Good.

349
00:24:11.055 --> 00:24:13.895
I thought childless couples had it easy,

350
00:24:13.895 --> 00:24:15.595
but they have problems too.

351
00:24:16.236 --> 00:24:18.135
You raise the kids all by yourself.

352
00:24:18.395 --> 00:24:21.006
I'd rather pull all-nighters for a full week.

353
00:24:21.006 --> 00:24:22.575
I can't stay home and raise kids.

354
00:24:22.976 --> 00:24:24.006
Oh, no.

355
00:24:25.476 --> 00:24:26.605
Me neither.

356
00:24:28.345 --> 00:24:29.476
But...

357
00:24:29.875 --> 00:24:31.845
the kids make it bearable.

358
00:24:33.315 --> 00:24:36.655
I get so furious every time they cause trouble.

359
00:24:36.716 --> 00:24:38.186
But when I see them sleeping in bed,

360
00:24:38.286 --> 00:24:41.226
I can't ever imagine my life without them.

361
00:24:43.055 --> 00:24:45.825
Where are you? I'm going to catch you!

362
00:24:46.165 --> 00:24:49.135
I told you to play with the kids, not scare them!

363
00:24:49.236 --> 00:24:50.365
My goodness.

364
00:24:50.365 --> 00:24:54.135
Gosh, what? I'm a real T-rex!

365
00:24:54.135 --> 00:24:55.565
You guys, it's your dad.

366
00:24:55.565 --> 00:24:56.976
Attack! Attack him!

367
00:24:56.976 --> 00:24:59.075
Oh, no! Don't attack me!

368
00:25:00.405 --> 00:25:01.706
You got me!

369
00:25:01.805 --> 00:25:03.046
Come here!

370
00:25:05.246 --> 00:25:07.016
Hey, by the way,

371
00:25:08.016 --> 00:25:09.986
haven't you thought of adopting?

372
00:25:10.815 --> 00:25:12.926
Single men and women are allowed to adopt.

373
00:25:15.226 --> 00:25:17.895
They take my job and wealth into consideration...

374
00:25:18.125 --> 00:25:21.625
and check if I have a family who can help me raise the kid.

375
00:25:22.065 --> 00:25:23.565
They have a few conditions,

376
00:25:23.736 --> 00:25:25.296
and I also need to pass a family test.

377
00:25:26.436 --> 00:25:28.165
I guess she already thought of it.

378
00:25:29.206 --> 00:25:32.135
A child should be a gift, not an alternative.

379
00:25:33.706 --> 00:25:35.815
I feel like I should be well-prepared...

380
00:25:35.815 --> 00:25:38.575
so that both the child and I don't end up getting hurt.

381
00:25:39.645 --> 00:25:40.885
But I don't think I'm ready.

382
00:25:44.486 --> 00:25:46.155
You think way too much.

383
00:25:46.825 --> 00:25:48.625
Okay, let's decide.

384
00:25:48.756 --> 00:25:50.155
Two can sleep in my room, and the one can sleep here.

385
00:25:50.355 --> 00:25:51.526
Do you want to play the ladder game?

386
00:25:52.296 --> 00:25:54.565
I want to go home.

387
00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:57.496
I suddenly miss my kids.

388
00:25:57.796 --> 00:25:59.006
I knew you'd be like that.

389
00:26:04.135 --> 00:26:05.905
Have fun and go home safely.

390
00:26:06.276 --> 00:26:07.875
Let's meet up again.

391
00:26:09.615 --> 00:26:11.946
But let's not meet up in this kind of mood again.

392
00:26:12.746 --> 00:26:14.115
Let me know when you made to home.

393
00:26:14.315 --> 00:26:15.385
Bye.

394
00:26:16.016 --> 00:26:18.016
Good night. Bye.

395
00:26:18.385 --> 00:26:19.726
Go home safely.

396
00:26:19.726 --> 00:26:21.085
- Okay, see you again. - Okay.

397
00:26:21.085 --> 00:26:22.625
- Call me. - Okay, bye.

398
00:26:24.825 --> 00:26:27.625
I guess you actually thought of having a baby.

399
00:26:28.665 --> 00:26:29.936
Yes, of course.

400
00:26:31.936 --> 00:26:35.165
I know life can feel a bit empty...

401
00:26:35.466 --> 00:26:37.736
without a kid sometimes,

402
00:26:38.006 --> 00:26:41.875
but I'm nervous that a kid...

403
00:26:41.976 --> 00:26:43.176
might shatter my stable life.

404
00:26:44.246 --> 00:26:48.385
My husband and I are very satisfied with our lives right now.

405
00:26:53.186 --> 00:26:56.555
How does it feel like to live without a kid?

406
00:26:57.555 --> 00:26:59.266
We're both very loyal to each other.

407
00:26:59.966 --> 00:27:01.526
It's just us,

408
00:27:02.125 --> 00:27:04.696
so we're very interested in each other.

409
00:27:06.466 --> 00:27:09.776
We're always curious of how the other person's day went.

410
00:27:11.875 --> 00:27:13.246
We check each other's feelings,

411
00:27:14.246 --> 00:27:15.446
and we do everything together.

412
00:27:16.516 --> 00:27:18.845
We give each other space.

413
00:27:19.516 --> 00:27:20.946
And if we feel like...

414
00:27:21.615 --> 00:27:23.716
going on a trip one day,

415
00:27:23.986 --> 00:27:25.686
we're able to leave right away.

416
00:27:27.155 --> 00:27:29.526
We mean everything to each other.

417
00:27:31.496 --> 00:27:32.595
So we're very affectionate.

418
00:27:39.466 --> 00:27:40.766
I guess people could live...

419
00:27:41.905 --> 00:27:43.536
without a kid.

420
00:27:46.446 --> 00:27:48.276
But other people think...

421
00:27:48.805 --> 00:27:50.875
it's both abnormal not to have kids after marriage...

422
00:27:51.075 --> 00:27:54.415
and to want kids without planning to get married.

423
00:27:55.486 --> 00:27:56.655
No one understands us.

424
00:27:58.216 --> 00:28:00.385
We don't live our lives hoping to be understood by others.

425
00:28:01.585 --> 00:28:03.496
We just do our best to make the right choice.

426
00:28:05.155 --> 00:28:06.466
We're doing well.

427
00:28:07.766 --> 00:28:10.095
- Let's go to bed. - Goodnight.

428
00:28:10.365 --> 00:28:11.436
You too.

429
00:28:34.726 --> 00:28:36.196
- I'll take this. - Okay.

430
00:28:45.565 --> 00:28:49.405
This is a Bed and Breakfast gift certificate for one night.

431
00:28:50.405 --> 00:28:52.946
- A gift certificate? - Yes.

432
00:28:54.145 --> 00:28:55.405
Gosh, I didn't expect this.

433
00:29:01.585 --> 00:29:02.885
Thank you.

434
00:29:05.516 --> 00:29:06.655
Yeon Ho.

435
00:29:07.385 --> 00:29:08.625
What would you have done...

436
00:29:08.625 --> 00:29:09.895
if your husband didn't come to pick you up?

437
00:29:10.655 --> 00:29:13.926
I just need to go home and tell him I'm hungry. Then he'll cook for me.

438
00:29:14.266 --> 00:29:15.696
That's how we make up.

439
00:29:21.536 --> 00:29:24.676
Ha Ri, have fun with your boyfriend.

440
00:29:25.635 --> 00:29:26.805
Thank you for last night.

441
00:29:26.976 --> 00:29:28.805
Go on. Hurry.

442
00:29:31.645 --> 00:29:32.786
Let's go home.

443
00:29:34.446 --> 00:29:37.385
- Do you know how much I cried? - Okay, okay.

444
00:29:37.885 --> 00:29:39.526
My gosh, I'm hungry.

445
00:29:43.895 --> 00:29:45.026
A place to go back to.

446
00:29:46.395 --> 00:29:48.165
Yeon Ho and Eun Young probably both left...

447
00:29:49.395 --> 00:29:51.966
because they knew they had a place to go back to.

448
00:29:55.135 --> 00:29:57.436
When my mom got surgery for stomach cancer,

449
00:29:58.135 --> 00:29:59.605
I was busy working.

450
00:30:00.905 --> 00:30:03.216
I had to get my work done and head to the hospital,

451
00:30:03.645 --> 00:30:06.686
so I had no time to be upset or be hard on myself.

452
00:30:08.446 --> 00:30:10.615
It felt unfamiliar to see my mom so sick.

453
00:30:11.786 --> 00:30:14.555
And she seemed so weak for the very first time.

454
00:30:15.325 --> 00:30:16.726
But it wasn't a big deal.

455
00:30:17.926 --> 00:30:19.026
I was fine.

456
00:30:20.266 --> 00:30:21.426
My mom and I...

457
00:30:23.736 --> 00:30:24.835
both brushed it off.

458
00:30:28.865 --> 00:30:32.176
But when I came home to an empty house,

459
00:30:33.976 --> 00:30:35.345
I suddenly felt sad.

460
00:30:37.375 --> 00:30:38.776
If my mom is gone,

461
00:30:41.716 --> 00:30:43.055
this empty house...

462
00:30:45.315 --> 00:30:47.456
would no longer be a place for me to come back to.

463
00:30:49.555 --> 00:30:50.655
I realized...

464
00:30:53.496 --> 00:30:55.325
that I'd have nowhere to go back to.

465
00:31:00.365 --> 00:31:02.165
No matter how far your journey is,

466
00:31:03.176 --> 00:31:04.835
and no matter how exhausted you are,

467
00:31:05.805 --> 00:31:07.706
you'll be able to get through it...

468
00:31:08.905 --> 00:31:10.516
as long as you have a place to go back to.

469
00:31:16.286 --> 00:31:17.456
Will that person...

470
00:31:18.385 --> 00:31:21.355
become my place to go back to?

471
00:31:37.335 --> 00:31:38.536
Do you want that?

472
00:31:38.905 --> 00:31:40.075
Isn't it adorable?

473
00:31:42.105 --> 00:31:44.915
Your entire house is filled with Moai statues, and you want more?

474
00:31:45.145 --> 00:31:46.645
I don't have that one.

475
00:31:46.885 --> 00:31:48.085
That one is new to me.

476
00:31:51.055 --> 00:31:53.155
I Sang really wants that.

477
00:31:53.686 --> 00:31:56.426
Gosh, you're not even drunk, so you're kind of scaring me.

478
00:31:58.296 --> 00:32:00.496
Let me explain what that was.

479
00:32:00.625 --> 00:32:03.635
The innocent child that was hidden deep down inside...

480
00:32:03.635 --> 00:32:05.395
suddenly just popped out.

481
00:32:07.335 --> 00:32:09.575
You're making me want to be immature as well.

482
00:32:10.905 --> 00:32:12.075
Choose between me and that.

483
00:32:14.476 --> 00:32:15.575
But...

484
00:32:16.815 --> 00:32:18.115
What do you mean?

485
00:32:18.315 --> 00:32:20.345
What? Why aren't you answering me?

486
00:32:21.385 --> 00:32:22.855
Are you actually thinking about it?

487
00:32:24.385 --> 00:32:25.956
No, what are you talking about?

488
00:32:26.825 --> 00:32:28.526
But you still haven't given me an answer.

489
00:32:29.625 --> 00:32:32.696
I can't compare that with you.

490
00:32:32.696 --> 00:32:35.766
Are you saying you like that way better?

491
00:32:35.825 --> 00:32:36.966
My gosh, no.

492
00:32:36.966 --> 00:32:39.436
My feelings for the Moai statue are different from how I feel...

493
00:32:39.436 --> 00:32:40.506
You're too late.

494
00:32:42.365 --> 00:32:44.536
No, wait. But...

495
00:32:53.786 --> 00:32:56.655
- Is this model safe to drive? - Yes, you can check inside.

496
00:32:56.655 --> 00:32:57.756
Okay.

497
00:33:11.835 --> 00:33:13.206
- Come this way. - Okay.

498
00:33:16.135 --> 00:33:18.236
- This is the living room. - I see.

499
00:33:23.276 --> 00:33:25.276
- Is that the Han River? - Yes, it is.

500
00:33:32.956 --> 00:33:34.055
It's nice.

501
00:33:35.825 --> 00:33:37.355
I should work hard.

502
00:33:41.625 --> 00:33:43.736
Gosh, you scared me.

503
00:33:44.096 --> 00:33:45.236
Was I too obvious?

504
00:33:45.966 --> 00:33:47.935
Stop encouraging me. It won't do any good.

505
00:33:49.006 --> 00:33:52.946
But quarreling with you makes it feel like we're really dating.

506
00:33:53.776 --> 00:33:56.245
We should be busy loving each other. Let's not quarrel.

507
00:34:00.616 --> 00:34:02.616
Do you want to go on a trip?

508
00:34:03.815 --> 00:34:06.526
You worked really hard, so you can take a break.

509
00:34:07.556 --> 00:34:09.285
- For one night? - Is that too short?

510
00:34:09.455 --> 00:34:10.596
How about for two nights?

511
00:34:12.296 --> 00:34:16.026
I'd also love to spend a lot of time with you,

512
00:34:16.026 --> 00:34:18.335
but I need to go to work.

513
00:34:19.196 --> 00:34:21.165
So I don't think I can spend two nights with...

514
00:34:25.535 --> 00:34:26.946
What are you thinking about?

515
00:34:27.046 --> 00:34:30.046
No, that's not what I meant. Do everything you want.

516
00:34:30.046 --> 00:34:33.785
You even gave me the toilet cleaner...

517
00:34:33.946 --> 00:34:36.486
The toilet cleaner?

518
00:34:37.355 --> 00:34:39.386
That was me taking a huge step, you know.

519
00:34:40.455 --> 00:34:42.685
I wanted to know how you felt about me.

520
00:34:42.685 --> 00:34:44.696
Don't think that I'm one of those women...

521
00:34:45.026 --> 00:34:46.966
who barge into other people's homes.

522
00:34:47.395 --> 00:34:50.966
That's not it. What I wanted to show you is...

523
00:34:50.966 --> 00:34:51.995
Save it.

524
00:34:52.495 --> 00:34:54.866
The toilet cleaner does wonders, right?

525
00:34:57.205 --> 00:34:58.375
Don't follow me.

526
00:35:00.806 --> 00:35:02.046
But...

527
00:35:03.015 --> 00:35:06.716
I was trying to invite you on an overnight trip.

528
00:35:07.486 --> 00:35:09.185
Why were you stuck in there?

529
00:35:21.165 --> 00:35:24.035
Why on earth would he bring up the toilet cleaner?

530
00:35:27.435 --> 00:35:28.866
Is he not coming after me?

531
00:35:30.435 --> 00:35:32.076
Then I should head home.

532
00:35:33.806 --> 00:35:35.176
I can't believe he didn't come after me.

533
00:35:45.315 --> 00:35:47.056
It's obvious that I said something wrong.

534
00:35:48.256 --> 00:35:50.725
I made her seem like some crazy woman.

535
00:35:57.495 --> 00:36:01.236
(Ha Ri)

536
00:36:02.406 --> 00:36:05.205
No way. This won't seem sincere at all.

537
00:36:05.535 --> 00:36:07.006
No texting.

538
00:36:11.875 --> 00:36:13.446
All right, I got it.

539
00:36:23.355 --> 00:36:26.366
(I love you.)

540
00:36:40.975 --> 00:36:42.046
Finally.

541
00:36:44.815 --> 00:36:46.716
I should text this to her.

542
00:36:51.685 --> 00:36:53.955
Am I supposed to call him first?

543
00:36:55.855 --> 00:36:56.855
Well...

544
00:36:57.556 --> 00:37:00.196
Why not? I guess I can do that.

545
00:37:00.966 --> 00:37:02.565
(Calls)

546
00:37:04.395 --> 00:37:06.466
(I Sang)

547
00:37:07.366 --> 00:37:09.466
As your boyfriend,

548
00:37:09.676 --> 00:37:13.346
I truly apologize for making you seem like someone...

549
00:37:13.875 --> 00:37:15.576
who's only interested in sex.

550
00:37:15.745 --> 00:37:18.846
I will do my best to make sure that nothing like this...

551
00:37:18.915 --> 00:37:20.815
ever happens again.

552
00:37:21.386 --> 00:37:24.156
Once again, I'm deeply sorry.

553
00:37:24.656 --> 00:37:26.386
I love you.

554
00:37:28.656 --> 00:37:30.026
I love you too.

555
00:37:49.946 --> 00:37:50.975
Watch out!

556
00:38:03.484 --> 00:38:04.655
Don't forget...

557
00:38:05.484 --> 00:38:07.484
this moment that I saved thy life.

558
00:38:09.484 --> 00:38:10.655
Remember this very second.

559
00:38:12.655 --> 00:38:13.894
Remember it.

560
00:38:15.894 --> 00:38:16.995
Thy?

561
00:38:21.834 --> 00:38:22.934
I'm sorry, Ms. Jang.

562
00:38:29.044 --> 00:38:30.075
Ms. Jang?

563
00:38:45.925 --> 00:38:47.865
For at least once,

564
00:38:52.394 --> 00:38:54.365
I wanted you to see me as a man.

565
00:38:58.405 --> 00:39:00.075
I admire you, you know.

566
00:39:01.104 --> 00:39:03.575
You also seem fragile which makes me want to protect you.

567
00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:06.914
But then again, you are someone I want to be like someday.

568
00:39:08.615 --> 00:39:12.214
I guess that's why I wanted you to be fond of me.

569
00:39:18.124 --> 00:39:21.164
However, I no longer want to be seen by you...

570
00:39:22.524 --> 00:39:24.195
in a certain way.

571
00:39:24.794 --> 00:39:27.234
All I want is to see you do well.

572
00:39:30.705 --> 00:39:32.405
That's all.

573
00:39:35.274 --> 00:39:36.945
Well, I'm good.

574
00:39:38.015 --> 00:39:41.285
And you've been a great comfort to me...

575
00:39:41.285 --> 00:39:42.984
in many ways.

576
00:39:45.984 --> 00:39:47.624
You're a nice guy, you know.

577
00:39:51.524 --> 00:39:52.695
Thank you.

578
00:40:05.805 --> 00:40:07.144
Hello.

579
00:40:08.004 --> 00:40:10.975
I forgot to bring Do Ah's medicine earlier.

580
00:40:11.044 --> 00:40:13.075
- Could you give her this? - Sure.

581
00:40:13.714 --> 00:40:17.285
By the way, Do Ah spilled juice on it.

582
00:40:19.655 --> 00:40:21.285
But this isn't hers.

583
00:40:21.925 --> 00:40:24.394
Her mother dropped it off.

584
00:40:25.225 --> 00:40:26.394
Her mom?

585
00:40:27.064 --> 00:40:30.234
She came by a few days ago with some clothes and toys...

586
00:40:30.234 --> 00:40:32.064
and spent a while watching Do Ah from outside.

587
00:40:44.575 --> 00:40:45.675
Jae Young.

588
00:40:46.314 --> 00:40:47.684
I'll allow visits.

589
00:40:47.984 --> 00:40:51.655
Don't confuse her in any way by dropping by at your convenience...

590
00:40:52.055 --> 00:40:54.084
but follow a strict schedule.

591
00:40:54.155 --> 00:40:55.684
Just so we're clear, this doesn't mean anything.

592
00:41:05.564 --> 00:41:07.265
So you have...

593
00:41:07.265 --> 00:41:09.564
a vacant room this weekend only?

594
00:41:10.675 --> 00:41:11.675
Right.

595
00:41:12.004 --> 00:41:14.475
Then, I'll book if for now.

596
00:41:14.845 --> 00:41:17.414
All right. Thank you.

597
00:41:19.374 --> 00:41:22.044
- You scared me. - Are you planning a weekend trip...

598
00:41:23.214 --> 00:41:25.214
with Ms. Jang? To where?

599
00:41:25.684 --> 00:41:26.754
Someplace nice?

600
00:41:28.584 --> 00:41:30.055
I'll never tell.

601
00:41:30.055 --> 00:41:32.095
Hold on. Let me see that.

602
00:41:32.095 --> 00:41:33.865
It's none of your business.

603
00:41:33.865 --> 00:41:36.734
We have a workshop planned for this weekend.

604
00:41:36.734 --> 00:41:39.905
What? But I have free movie tickets. Won't you be able to make it?

605
00:41:40.064 --> 00:41:42.004
Probably not.

606
00:41:42.365 --> 00:41:44.135
How can I not attend the company workshop?

607
00:41:44.334 --> 00:41:46.845
Ms. Jang's has been excitedly making plans.

608
00:41:47.245 --> 00:41:49.075
I need to pretend to enjoy it.

609
00:41:49.475 --> 00:41:50.475
Shall we?

610
00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:56.754
Did you book the room without confirming her schedule first?

611
00:42:01.955 --> 00:42:03.995
You should take your wife.

612
00:42:06.325 --> 00:42:08.464
I wasn't asking, but thanks.

613
00:42:14.104 --> 00:42:15.305
Everything will work out for you.

614
00:42:16.265 --> 00:42:17.434
I'm sure of it.

615
00:42:19.234 --> 00:42:20.405
Thanks again.

616
00:42:21.245 --> 00:42:23.374
Gosh, this place seems luxurious.

617
00:42:23.945 --> 00:42:27.285
We're not allowed to go since the company isn't doing well.

618
00:42:28.044 --> 00:42:29.845
The workshop got canceled?

619
00:42:29.984 --> 00:42:32.455
Hold on. But "The Deco" team went.

620
00:42:32.615 --> 00:42:33.655
Is it just us then?

621
00:42:34.184 --> 00:42:36.455
Can they treat us this poorly?

622
00:42:36.925 --> 00:42:38.854
There's a rumor going on about us ceasing to publish...

623
00:42:38.854 --> 00:42:40.894
and now our workshop got canceled.

624
00:42:41.265 --> 00:42:44.035
Could "The Baby" actually be discontinued?

625
00:42:45.234 --> 00:42:47.464
We'll have to work hard in order to stop that.

626
00:42:47.834 --> 00:42:49.604
Think of any events we can hold...

627
00:42:49.604 --> 00:42:52.135
that'll prove how we're still relevant.

628
00:42:52.475 --> 00:42:53.604
Sure.

629
00:42:53.874 --> 00:42:55.475
Go back to work then.

630
00:42:56.104 --> 00:42:57.414
Got it.

631
00:42:58.214 --> 00:43:00.285
I can't believe this.

632
00:43:06.455 --> 00:43:07.655
Hello, sir.

633
00:43:07.854 --> 00:43:10.354
It's nice to see you. Gosh.

634
00:43:11.325 --> 00:43:12.624
Have you been well?

635
00:43:14.664 --> 00:43:17.365
- What's wrong? - The ice cream ad.

636
00:43:17.865 --> 00:43:19.265
The contract got canceled.

637
00:43:20.504 --> 00:43:22.934
They aren't willing to pay much for an experienced photographer.

638
00:43:26.035 --> 00:43:28.205
The photos came out great, so I'm fine with it.

639
00:43:28.504 --> 00:43:29.705
Instead,

640
00:43:30.314 --> 00:43:32.874
we got a coffee ad.

641
00:43:35.814 --> 00:43:39.055
The shoot was scheduled already for this weekend. Can you do it?

642
00:43:40.484 --> 00:43:42.484
This weekend.

643
00:43:42.984 --> 00:43:44.695
We have a workshop planned for this weekend.

644
00:43:44.794 --> 00:43:47.294
Ms. Jang's has been excitedly making plans.

645
00:43:48.725 --> 00:43:51.495
Sure. Might as well work this weekend.

646
00:43:52.234 --> 00:43:54.834
Let's have a nice romantic weekend together this weekend.

647
00:43:56.734 --> 00:43:59.834
How is a PTA meeting more important than me?

648
00:44:00.445 --> 00:44:02.305
It's not the first time.

649
00:44:02.975 --> 00:44:05.144
Mr. Nam!

650
00:44:05.845 --> 00:44:08.314
- Mr. Nam. So... - What?

651
00:44:08.745 --> 00:44:11.214
Oh no.

652
00:44:11.214 --> 00:44:13.285
- Mr. Nam! - Hold on.

653
00:44:13.285 --> 00:44:14.754
I'll call you back.

654
00:44:15.124 --> 00:44:16.385
Oh, no.

655
00:44:16.555 --> 00:44:19.595
This is a limited edition that just came out.

656
00:44:19.794 --> 00:44:20.865
Oh, no.

657
00:44:22.294 --> 00:44:24.394
I... I'll pay the dry cleaning bill.

658
00:44:26.535 --> 00:44:28.234
It's an expensive dress.

659
00:44:33.035 --> 00:44:35.445
Can I make it up to you with this?

660
00:44:39.814 --> 00:44:41.245
Darn it.

661
00:44:52.495 --> 00:44:54.365
Eu Ddeum.

662
00:44:54.365 --> 00:44:55.464
Hello.

663
00:44:55.865 --> 00:44:56.964
Do you feel okay?

664
00:44:57.635 --> 00:44:58.734
I do.

665
00:45:07.644 --> 00:45:08.745
Eu Ddeum.

666
00:45:11.044 --> 00:45:13.314
I was too embarrassed to say this before,

667
00:45:13.445 --> 00:45:16.015
but thank you for protecting me at the police station.

668
00:45:18.515 --> 00:45:20.754
There were many drunk people there.

669
00:45:20.854 --> 00:45:22.425
And above all,

670
00:45:22.825 --> 00:45:24.794
I was afraid you'd do something humiliating.

671
00:45:25.024 --> 00:45:26.195
That's why I couldn't leave.

672
00:45:30.195 --> 00:45:34.405
Well, regardless. Thank you very much.

673
00:45:35.604 --> 00:45:37.075
So... here.

674
00:45:40.245 --> 00:45:42.044
What is this?

675
00:45:42.905 --> 00:45:44.544
It's a gift card for a bed and breakfast.

676
00:45:44.745 --> 00:45:47.684
If you have no one to go with, I can...

677
00:45:48.214 --> 00:45:50.385
Thank you. My parents will love it.

678
00:45:50.555 --> 00:45:51.684
Thank you.

679
00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:56.385
Why are you suddenly bringing up your parents?

680
00:45:57.024 --> 00:45:58.595
I shouldn't have given it to him.

681
00:45:58.695 --> 00:45:59.925
What a waste.

682
00:46:01.464 --> 00:46:02.725
- Eu Ddeum. - Yes?

683
00:46:02.725 --> 00:46:05.394
- This needs approval. - Okay.

684
00:46:09.405 --> 00:46:12.205
I... I'm so sorry.

685
00:46:13.675 --> 00:46:17.575
I'm a terrible husband who forgot our anniversary.

686
00:46:19.615 --> 00:46:21.345
Even though we couldn't travel abroad,

687
00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:24.484
I should've at least taken you somewhere nice for dinner.

688
00:46:24.914 --> 00:46:27.524
You work your fingers to the bone,

689
00:46:28.055 --> 00:46:29.955
but I haven't done anything for you.

690
00:46:32.555 --> 00:46:34.064
I'm so sorry.

691
00:46:35.894 --> 00:46:37.995
- Next year, I... - Mr. Kim.

692
00:46:38.434 --> 00:46:39.495
Yes?

693
00:46:40.265 --> 00:46:41.405
Hold on.

694
00:46:42.535 --> 00:46:43.604
What is it?

695
00:46:49.274 --> 00:46:51.745
- What? - Go here.

696
00:46:53.245 --> 00:46:54.245
What is this?

697
00:46:54.245 --> 00:46:55.644
A bed and breakfast gift certificate.

698
00:46:56.885 --> 00:46:57.955
What?

699
00:46:59.984 --> 00:47:03.354
My gosh. Why did he get me something like this?

700
00:47:05.894 --> 00:47:07.394
Noh Sun Jae's Bed and Breakfast?

701
00:47:07.964 --> 00:47:09.095
Where is this place?

702
00:47:13.135 --> 00:47:14.305
- Sir. - What?

703
00:47:14.305 --> 00:47:17.075
The sales report is all messed up again.

704
00:47:17.175 --> 00:47:19.175
What is wrong with the Advertising Department?

705
00:47:19.504 --> 00:47:20.845
Really? Again?

706
00:47:20.975 --> 00:47:23.845
How many times is this? This is exhausting.

707
00:47:23.945 --> 00:47:25.714
Okay. I'll check it again.

708
00:47:26.414 --> 00:47:28.245
You didn't report it yet to Mr. Joo, did you?

709
00:47:28.385 --> 00:47:30.214
- I'm going to now. - No!

710
00:47:30.785 --> 00:47:32.214
Don't be like that.

711
00:47:35.825 --> 00:47:38.524
Here. Take your husband.

712
00:47:39.095 --> 00:47:41.225
It's a really nice bed and breakfast.

713
00:47:42.394 --> 00:47:45.495
- You can't give me these things... - No, no.

714
00:47:45.664 --> 00:47:47.305
- I'll check it. Okay. - You can't...

715
00:47:47.734 --> 00:47:49.664
Don't tell Ms. Jang either.

716
00:47:50.805 --> 00:47:53.575
Well. I'll let you go this one time.

717
00:47:53.774 --> 00:47:54.874
Thanks.

718
00:48:16.794 --> 00:48:18.434
For letting me stay the night.

719
00:48:19.365 --> 00:48:20.964
It's booked for this weekend.

720
00:48:21.234 --> 00:48:22.604
Take Mr. Han.

721
00:48:23.265 --> 00:48:24.434
This weekend?

722
00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:25.734
Yes.

723
00:48:26.975 --> 00:48:29.104
(Noh Sun Jae's Bed and Breakfast)

724
00:48:39.885 --> 00:48:41.024
What's this?

725
00:48:42.354 --> 00:48:43.794
I got a new car.

726
00:48:44.225 --> 00:48:45.294
Get in.

727
00:49:02.874 --> 00:49:04.414
Why did you suddenly get a car?

728
00:49:05.314 --> 00:49:06.714
Do Ah's big now.

729
00:49:06.914 --> 00:49:08.814
I'll have to take her places soon.

730
00:49:10.015 --> 00:49:12.515
Should I pick you up if you finish work late?

731
00:49:13.354 --> 00:49:15.425
Why are you worrying about me too?

732
00:49:17.655 --> 00:49:19.825
I'm looking for a place by the hospital.

733
00:49:21.425 --> 00:49:24.095
- Are you moving out? - I should find my own place.

734
00:49:24.894 --> 00:49:26.765
My clinic is pretty settled down now.

735
00:49:26.995 --> 00:49:28.664
I can watch Do Ah on my own now.

736
00:49:29.104 --> 00:49:31.475
I'm making her formula myself too.

737
00:49:31.575 --> 00:49:32.705
Nice.

738
00:49:34.175 --> 00:49:37.745
You may think of me as the runny-nosed little kid...

739
00:49:37.745 --> 00:49:40.015
who used to get beat up by you,

740
00:49:40.584 --> 00:49:43.144
but I'm a pretty decent guy.

741
00:49:44.285 --> 00:49:46.854
You sold your perfectly good car and apartment...

742
00:49:46.854 --> 00:49:48.425
and lived like a deadbeat.

743
00:49:49.385 --> 00:49:52.825
It's like watching Australopithecus evolve into a human.

744
00:49:52.825 --> 00:49:54.765
I'm so proud of you.

745
00:49:56.695 --> 00:49:58.495
I should live like a decent human being...

746
00:49:59.635 --> 00:50:02.635
while making the people I love happy.

747
00:50:07.945 --> 00:50:10.345
I'm going apartment hunting this weekend.

748
00:50:10.515 --> 00:50:11.675
Will you go with me?

749
00:50:12.845 --> 00:50:13.984
I'd like your advice.

750
00:50:28.225 --> 00:50:29.294
Do you want to go here?

751
00:50:31.394 --> 00:50:34.265
Noh Sun Jae's Bed and Breakfast. It's supposed to be pretty nice.

752
00:50:34.365 --> 00:50:36.734
I really wanted to go, but you should go instead.

753
00:50:37.374 --> 00:50:40.745
Take Jeong Won and Do Ah this weekend...

754
00:50:40.745 --> 00:50:41.845
Ha Ri.

755
00:50:44.445 --> 00:50:46.544
I'm asking you right now...

756
00:50:48.785 --> 00:50:50.314
to look at places with me.

757
00:50:55.785 --> 00:50:57.955
Auntie says she'll watch Do Ah.

758
00:50:59.024 --> 00:51:01.325
Let's eat, check out places together,

759
00:51:01.964 --> 00:51:03.425
and hear me out.

760
00:51:04.664 --> 00:51:06.695
I want to tell you how I plan...

761
00:51:08.564 --> 00:51:10.004
to live from now on.

762
00:51:15.004 --> 00:51:17.345
Sure, I can listen to my friend.

763
00:51:19.814 --> 00:51:20.885
But...

764
00:51:22.644 --> 00:51:24.055
let's talk later.

765
00:51:27.084 --> 00:51:28.425
Let's talk that day.

766
00:51:36.394 --> 00:51:37.535
Did you get off work?

767
00:51:37.635 --> 00:51:39.135
I'll wait in the park.

768
00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:46.774
Drop me off up there. I have plans.

769
00:51:50.345 --> 00:51:51.445
Sure.

770
00:52:01.055 --> 00:52:02.124
Bye.

771
00:52:20.374 --> 00:52:21.905
I almost forgot what you look like.

772
00:52:21.905 --> 00:52:23.504
It has been way too long.

773
00:52:23.644 --> 00:52:25.214
We are way too busy.

774
00:52:26.175 --> 00:52:27.484
What are you doing this weekend?

775
00:52:28.785 --> 00:52:30.655
I have a shoot this weekend.

776
00:52:32.254 --> 00:52:33.455
You work on weekends too?

777
00:52:34.725 --> 00:52:36.455
I was going to ask you to go away with me.

778
00:52:38.825 --> 00:52:41.164
I thought you had a workshop this weekend.

779
00:52:41.695 --> 00:52:43.894
- It got canceled. - It got canceled?

780
00:52:45.095 --> 00:52:48.035
Why? Is that a bad thing?

781
00:52:50.675 --> 00:52:52.905
No. What's done is done.

782
00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:58.044
I got a gift certificate for a bed and breakfast this weekend.

783
00:52:58.274 --> 00:52:59.414
I guess you can't go.

784
00:53:00.984 --> 00:53:02.214
A bed and breakfast gift certificate?

785
00:53:02.945 --> 00:53:04.984
- Where? - You can't even go.

786
00:53:04.984 --> 00:53:08.385
Do you think I'd tell you it's Noh Sun Jae's Bed and Breakfast...

787
00:53:08.385 --> 00:53:10.425
at 17-gil Bongsun-ro, Japyeong, Gyeonggi Province?

788
00:53:12.555 --> 00:53:13.754
Do you have the gift certificate with you?

789
00:53:14.995 --> 00:53:16.365
- Yes. - Let me see it.

790
00:53:21.064 --> 00:53:22.164
Here.

791
00:53:28.805 --> 00:53:29.874
What is it?

792
00:53:30.714 --> 00:53:33.314
We really should go here.

793
00:53:33.714 --> 00:53:36.285
Let's go even if the shoot ends late at night.

794
00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:38.885
We don't need to go if your work finishes late.

795
00:53:39.684 --> 00:53:43.325
I feel like we'll end up going here no matter what.

796
00:53:43.624 --> 00:53:44.695
You just wait.

797
00:53:44.825 --> 00:53:46.195
- Really? - Yes.

798
00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:16.254
- You're here. - Hello.

799
00:54:17.425 --> 00:54:18.794
- Long time no see. - Hello.

800
00:54:18.794 --> 00:54:20.425
You came a long way.

801
00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:23.865
Sir!

802
00:54:26.035 --> 00:54:28.205
I packed a few stuff so you could do a taste test.

803
00:54:29.265 --> 00:54:32.175
This is all you're going to give me? You could've given me more.

804
00:54:32.834 --> 00:54:35.144
This is a lot more than it seems.

805
00:54:35.745 --> 00:54:36.945
But should I bring you more?

806
00:54:37.104 --> 00:54:38.414
No, it's okay.

807
00:54:38.945 --> 00:54:41.015
- Thank you for this. - No problem.

808
00:54:43.544 --> 00:54:44.655
By the way,

809
00:54:45.214 --> 00:54:47.684
is Ha Ri still working at the same company?

810
00:54:48.385 --> 00:54:50.155
What? Ha Ri?

811
00:54:51.425 --> 00:54:54.664
I wonder how she's doing these days.

812
00:55:00.195 --> 00:55:01.905
My goodness.

813
00:55:02.064 --> 00:55:03.135
Did he leave?

814
00:55:03.964 --> 00:55:05.734
What does he do for a living?

815
00:55:05.734 --> 00:55:08.305
He always shows up all of a sudden with so much money.

816
00:55:08.604 --> 00:55:12.475
But why does he suddenly want to know where Ha Ri is working at?

817
00:55:13.575 --> 00:55:16.214
- You should've said you don't know. - Well...

818
00:55:16.785 --> 00:55:18.814
I was going to.

819
00:55:18.814 --> 00:55:21.285
But he's very quick-witted.

820
00:55:21.285 --> 00:55:23.984
Do you think it's because he used to gamble for a long time?

821
00:55:24.055 --> 00:55:26.254
So what did you say? Did you tell him?

822
00:55:26.595 --> 00:55:28.995
Well, I just told him...

823
00:55:28.995 --> 00:55:31.294
that she's probably still working at the same company.

824
00:55:31.664 --> 00:55:34.964
Why did you tell him that? What if Ok Ran finds out?

825
00:55:35.234 --> 00:55:38.035
What if she gets angry and kicks us out of the building?

826
00:55:39.504 --> 00:55:41.445
Should I have told him that she emigrated abroad?

827
00:55:43.175 --> 00:55:44.374
My gosh, you're unbelievable.

828
00:55:45.144 --> 00:55:46.374
Hi, guys.

829
00:55:46.914 --> 00:55:49.214
Give me some freshly baked bread.

830
00:55:55.555 --> 00:55:57.555
My gosh, I'll pay for the bread.

831
00:55:57.854 --> 00:55:59.794
Just make sure you pay your rent on time.

832
00:56:00.225 --> 00:56:02.664
Oh, okay.

833
00:56:06.064 --> 00:56:09.064
I have a lot on my mind these days.

834
00:56:10.035 --> 00:56:11.874
Why?

835
00:56:12.374 --> 00:56:13.774
Did something happen?

836
00:56:14.004 --> 00:56:17.774
There are two guys who want to be with Ha Ri.

837
00:56:18.274 --> 00:56:20.644
One is a doctor, and the other is a photographer.

838
00:56:20.945 --> 00:56:23.984
They both have nice jobs and are good-looking.

839
00:56:25.184 --> 00:56:28.225
Who am I supposed to choose?

840
00:56:29.225 --> 00:56:30.584
My goodness.

841
00:56:30.584 --> 00:56:32.925
You talk as if it's a big problem when you should be bragging.

842
00:56:33.055 --> 00:56:36.765
I don't know if I should be jealous or if I should help you choose.

843
00:56:37.664 --> 00:56:40.334
Let's help her choose. I'm happy for you, Ok Ran.

844
00:56:41.104 --> 00:56:44.104
Hey, tell me Ha Ri's phone number.

845
00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:02.155
Have a nice weekend.

846
00:57:02.155 --> 00:57:04.225
- Bye. - Bye.

847
00:57:22.374 --> 00:57:25.544
(Yoon Jae Young)

848
00:57:42.524 --> 00:57:45.064
Jae Young, I'm not going.

849
00:57:45.564 --> 00:57:46.834
Don't wait for me.

850
00:57:56.774 --> 00:58:00.015
Why did you book two photo shoots in a day?

851
00:58:00.515 --> 00:58:02.214
Just hurry up.

852
00:58:03.044 --> 00:58:04.144
Excuse me.

853
00:58:04.655 --> 00:58:05.914
Where is the model?

854
00:58:08.584 --> 00:58:12.055
She just finished her shoot in the suburbs.

855
00:58:12.055 --> 00:58:14.865
Can you please wait just a little bit longer?

856
00:58:14.995 --> 00:58:17.365
She'll be right here.

857
00:58:17.495 --> 00:58:20.495
I've been waiting for three hours.

858
00:58:21.004 --> 00:58:22.405
Wouldn't it be better...

859
00:58:22.405 --> 00:58:25.004
to postpone the photo shoot?

860
00:58:25.135 --> 00:58:27.305
Can you please do me a favor just this once?

861
00:58:27.504 --> 00:58:29.644
It's really hard to reschedule.

862
00:58:29.644 --> 00:58:32.075
And the client wants the photo shoot today...

863
00:58:32.075 --> 00:58:34.285
so they can stick to their schedule.

864
00:58:34.285 --> 00:58:37.385
Gosh, can you please wait just this once?

865
00:58:37.484 --> 00:58:39.214
Please do me a favor.

866
00:58:39.285 --> 00:58:40.555
I even have a kid.

867
00:58:58.834 --> 00:59:01.075
Are you done? I'm already here.

868
00:59:02.274 --> 00:59:04.445
I think the shoot will end really late at night.

869
00:59:04.714 --> 00:59:06.274
It might end past midnight.

870
00:59:07.144 --> 00:59:09.044
I'm sorry you're there all by yourself.

871
00:59:10.214 --> 00:59:12.684
I'll wait until you come.

872
00:59:13.314 --> 00:59:16.325
If you can't make it, I'll just get some rest on my own.

873
00:59:17.894 --> 00:59:20.055
I'll be there as soon as I finish the shoot.

874
00:59:21.124 --> 00:59:22.195
I'm sorry.

875
00:59:22.664 --> 00:59:24.064
I'll be waiting then.

876
00:59:41.584 --> 00:59:44.385
You look great. Good. That's great.

877
00:59:44.814 --> 00:59:46.285
Just a second.

878
00:59:55.164 --> 00:59:56.265
Let's carry on.

879
00:59:57.964 --> 00:59:59.164
You look nice.

880
01:00:29.495 --> 01:00:31.934
(I Sang)

881
01:00:36.865 --> 01:00:38.334
(I Sang)

882
01:01:04.195 --> 01:01:07.495
(Nitwit)

883
01:01:12.475 --> 01:01:14.374
(Punk Jae Young)

884
01:01:20.475 --> 01:01:21.544
Hello?

885
01:01:23.214 --> 01:01:24.314
Where are you?

886
01:01:26.515 --> 01:01:29.555
I'm at the bed and breakfast. I'm waiting for I Sang.

887
01:01:31.024 --> 01:01:32.555
You're there by yourself?

888
01:01:35.524 --> 01:01:37.964
Is he coming or not?

889
01:01:38.265 --> 01:01:40.064
Are you waiting there by yourself...

890
01:01:40.794 --> 01:01:42.504
even though he might not show up?

891
01:01:43.635 --> 01:01:46.334
Whether or not he shows up isn't important.

892
01:01:47.135 --> 01:01:49.705
What matters is that I'm waiting for him.

893
01:01:54.445 --> 01:01:55.745
Ha Ri.

894
01:02:00.115 --> 01:02:01.854
I'll go pick you up.

895
01:02:03.524 --> 01:02:05.195
Let's go home together.

896
01:02:07.595 --> 01:02:10.195
- Jae Young. - Why are you waiting for him?

897
01:02:10.564 --> 01:02:12.995
Why are you waiting for someone who might not even come?

898
01:02:13.995 --> 01:02:16.234
Why are you waiting for a guy...

899
01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:19.934
who can't even give you assurance?

900
01:02:24.104 --> 01:02:25.814
Because I want to wait for him.

901
01:02:27.314 --> 01:02:29.544
I chose to wait for him, so it's okay, Jae Young.

902
01:03:26.234 --> 01:03:27.705
- Bye, Mr. Han! - Bye.

903
01:03:27.705 --> 01:03:28.805
Bye!

904
01:03:29.475 --> 01:03:30.874
- Thank you! - You're welcome!

905
01:04:16.885 --> 01:04:18.394
Sorry I'm late.

906
01:06:18.544 --> 01:06:21.345
(Oh My Baby)

907
01:06:21.544 --> 01:06:23.245
I don't think I can even look at her now.

908
01:06:23.445 --> 01:06:25.084
There's nothing I can do anymore.

909
01:06:25.385 --> 01:06:27.015
I just got greedy for a second.

910
01:06:27.354 --> 01:06:28.785
Don't tell me you're at the hospital.

911
01:06:29.655 --> 01:06:30.684
What are you doing here?

912
01:06:30.684 --> 01:06:32.854
Whether you're sick, whether you die...

913
01:06:33.124 --> 01:06:34.325
I'm sorry, Ha Ri.

914
01:06:34.325 --> 01:06:36.325
Why on earth would you be sorry?

915
01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:38.024
Don't you wish to always be with me?

916
01:06:38.024 --> 01:06:39.365
Mull over the idea.

917
01:06:39.535 --> 01:06:41.164
Is he going to propose to me?

918
01:06:41.164 --> 01:06:44.265
No way. Not in front of all our colleagues.

919
01:06:44.365 --> 01:06:45.475
How should I answer him?

920
01:06:45.475 --> 01:06:47.205
"Yes, let's get married!"

921
01:06:47.334 --> 01:06:48.405
"Sounds good."

922
01:06:48.575 --> 01:06:49.705
What do I do?

923
01:06:50.875 --> 01:06:51.974
My gosh.
