00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.880
The world suddenly changed after I became the editor-in-chief.

2
00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:48.880
My gosh, what is all this?

3
00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:52.120
This isn't much, but I hope...

4
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.620
you have a hearty meal.

5
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.890
Thank you for breakfast.

6
00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.649
Thank you for breakfast.

7
00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.559
What is this? It's braised short ribs.

8
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.500
Ms. Editor-in-chief, you can have the first bite.

9
00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.239
Your braised short ribs are the best.

10
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.209
It's so good.

11
00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:27.019
Congratulations on your promotion.

12
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.489
(Editor-in-chief, Jang Ha Ri)

13
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.690
Ms. Jang.

14
00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:38.259
- That's so pretty. - What is that?

15
00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.160
It's for Ms. Jang.

16
00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:45.369
You know you're cuter than all babies, right?

17
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.869
Gosh, it's beautiful.

18
00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:51.280
Get back to work.

19
00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.080
Oh, okay.

20
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.750
Gosh, okay.

21
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.879
The position must bring out the worst in people.

22
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.050
What?

23
00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:04.360
- Congratulations on your promotion. - Congratulations!

24
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.190
Thanks.

25
00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.629
- Nice. - Gosh, that's good.

26
00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.060
So how does it feel?

27
00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.160
Sweet.

28
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.769
I knew it!

29
00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.739
Guys, everything's on me today.

30
00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.610
- Really? - Let's have some fun then.

31
00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:28.280
So this must be how it feels to have the world at your fingertips.

32
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.179
The feeling only lasted a day.

33
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.509
What...

34
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.650
(Ladies)

35
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.250
(Wonsan Sauna)

36
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.169
Did you come to work early to see me?

37
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.000
You probably skipped breakfast. Do you want some?

38
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.449
Don't tell me you don't recognize me.

39
00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.020
As if. You're Jang Ha Ri,

40
00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:39.620
my girlfriend.

41
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.750
You didn't recognize me, did you?

42
00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.560
It's not that. I just haven't seen you in so long...

43
00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.660
that I couldn't believe my eyes.

44
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.060
Let me carry that.

45
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.009
Ms. Do Ah.

46
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.720
Let's put on some socks and get going.

47
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.590
Here you go.

48
00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:18.819
Ha Ri didn't come home last night.

49
00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.690
She's desperate to get pregnant,

50
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.460
but she spent another night working late.

51
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.770
Do you perhaps have any news to share?

52
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.069
Are you worried she might grow old without kids?

53
00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:32.870
I'm worried she'd grow old alone.

54
00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.940
I'm curious though.

55
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.009
Are some men okay with donating their sperm...

56
00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:44.620
to complete strangers?

57
00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.220
Are you all right with Ha Ri raising a child...

58
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.990
all on her own?

59
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.960
No mom wants her daughter to become a single mother.

60
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.489
We all want them to meet someone and form a nice family.

61
00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:00.130
I couldn't help but agree to it because her clock's ticking.

62
00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:03.229
Her problem can still be solved...

63
00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.070
if she can meet someone decent.

64
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.710
I don't think she'll be able to find anyone.

65
00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:11.070
Seriously?

66
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.479
Is this what I get for feeding you?

67
00:05:13.609 --> 00:05:15.410
Are you suggesting that she grow old alone?

68
00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:20.220
Auntie, what if I kept living with her?

69
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.220
You?

70
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.859
I just have to be by her side like I am now.

71
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.289
It's how we've always been.

72
00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:36.030
Do Ah, let's get you fed...

73
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.169
and on your way.

74
00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:40.499
Come on.

75
00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:52.950
Here.

76
00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:00.660
You should contain yourself.

77
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.030
Ha Ri.

78
00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:28.590
- My gosh. - Goodness.

79
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.660
- Have a good day then. - You too.

80
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.729
Sure.

81
00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:39.499
I can't contain myself though.

82
00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:42.700
When are we supposed to see each other...

83
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:45.470
if you work in the evening and all night long?

84
00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:49.739
The deadline is today, so we'll have all the time to go on dates.

85
00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:52.380
Sounds good to me.

86
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.849
Is there something you want to say?

87
00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:05.320
There's a lot...

88
00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.720
I haven't said.

89
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.799
I love this time of the day.

90
00:07:15.429 --> 00:07:17.869
A moment of peace and quiet in the morning.

91
00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:23.340
Before people get to the office,

92
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.539
could we hug?

93
00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:29.609
Sure thing.

94
00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:54.299
(Episode 9: The Moments That We Say It's Love 2)

95
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.410
- Hyo Joo. - Yes?

96
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.439
Yes, Ms. Jang?

97
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.080
Should I rewrite it?

98
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.450
Only the marked parts.

99
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.489
Have you sent over your final drafts?

100
00:08:17.489 --> 00:08:19.130
What? No, not yet.

101
00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.299
Yeon Ho, are you going to be the last one...

102
00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:22.999
- to send it in this month? - Sorry?

103
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.270
No...

104
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:28.369
If we don't meet today's deadline, we'll all be dead,

105
00:08:28.369 --> 00:08:29.539
- so stay focused. - Okay.

106
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.510
Mr. Kim, are you done?

107
00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:38.549
- Ms. Jang. - Hi.

108
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.820
Yes, Eu Ddeum's doing a final revision.

109
00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:45.390
- Are you done? - Almost. I'll hurry, sir.

110
00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:46.660
Please do.

111
00:08:46.919 --> 00:08:48.489
What about the lack of advertisements this month?

112
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.330
Still, we signed on more for those on social media.

113
00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:55.130
What if we lowered the cost by offering a spread too?

114
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.539
I already pitched that idea, but no one's biting.

115
00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.570
Anyway, it looks good.

116
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:01.739
Thank you.

117
00:09:14.789 --> 00:09:15.919
Ms. Jang.

118
00:09:16.319 --> 00:09:17.890
Yes, Eu Ddeum. Are you heading home?

119
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.289
No, not yet.

120
00:09:20.319 --> 00:09:21.829
I wasn't scolded as much this time.

121
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:24.089
I'm proud of you, Eu Ddeum.

122
00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:27.199
Being scolded by seniors don't make you learn.

123
00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:30.299
Over the years, you just do by watching others.

124
00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:33.000
Then I'll learn from the manager.

125
00:09:34.169 --> 00:09:35.740
You can learn from Mr. Kim...

126
00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.709
as long as it's not about kissing butts...

127
00:09:37.809 --> 00:09:40.309
or stealing gifts for our readers.

128
00:09:40.439 --> 00:09:43.549
I mean I'll learn from you, Ms. Jang.

129
00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:46.049
Me?

130
00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:48.390
As if there's anything to learn from me.

131
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.719
Let's grab something to eat.

132
00:09:50.049 --> 00:09:53.719
It's wrong to tease your elders. Give that back.

133
00:09:53.789 --> 00:09:55.030
Say yes and I will.

134
00:09:55.329 --> 00:09:57.429
- Eat with me. - Aren't you a cheeky one.

135
00:09:57.829 --> 00:09:59.500
- Give that back. - Say yes.

136
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:00.860
- Eat with me. - Give it back.

137
00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:03.100
- Unbelievable. - Let's grab a bite.

138
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.770
Let's eat.

139
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.309
- Come on. - To thank you for the workout,

140
00:10:11.309 --> 00:10:12.510
I'll buy.

141
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:16.110
- Really? - You're unbelievable.

142
00:10:17.209 --> 00:10:19.219
Actually, I'll be buying today.

143
00:10:19.219 --> 00:10:20.819
Do as you please then.

144
00:10:21.589 --> 00:10:23.949
- Unbelievable. - I'll call you.

145
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:28.890
The photo for the restaurant flyer, right?

146
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.699
Of course it's possible. I know what I'm doing.

147
00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:34.199
Sure thing. Call me straight away then.

148
00:10:34.199 --> 00:10:35.900
Of course. Thank you!

149
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.339
- Soo Chul. - What the...

150
00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:40.600
Are you still working part-time gigs?

151
00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:42.969
When did you get here?

152
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:45.579
I don't know when Ha Ri will get off work,

153
00:10:45.579 --> 00:10:46.880
so I came here to wait.

154
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.350
You guys couldn't be cornier.

155
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.549
I cringe every time I see you now.

156
00:10:52.079 --> 00:10:54.319
How many of these random gigs are you working?

157
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:57.049
Publicity booklets, wedding photos,

158
00:10:57.049 --> 00:10:58.990
and even flyers, so everything.

159
00:10:59.819 --> 00:11:01.020
Has money been tight?

160
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.459
My kid plays the flute and is good at it.

161
00:11:04.589 --> 00:11:05.929
At least, that's what I heard.

162
00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:08.329
A music tutor needs to be hired,

163
00:11:08.329 --> 00:11:10.100
so that and the rent here...

164
00:11:10.699 --> 00:11:12.770
The family needs 5,000 dollars a month...

165
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.799
just to do the bare minimum.

166
00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:17.839
That's a reality I never wish to know.

167
00:11:19.539 --> 00:11:22.750
I'm jealous of your life in some ways.

168
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:24.750
Why? Because I'm not married?

169
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.219
No, because you're still a wanted photographer.

170
00:11:29.419 --> 00:11:31.890
I've never been one...

171
00:11:32.089 --> 00:11:34.120
to be jealous of other people's talents,

172
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.490
but I've been working hard every second these days...

173
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.230
that I'm losing self-respect for myself.

174
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.630
What on earth happened to me?

175
00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:47.870
But I find it the hardest to live intently though.

176
00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:50.469
Soo Chul,

177
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.110
- you're cool. - Gosh.

178
00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:57.880
You should get ready to look cool.

179
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.219
You're in a serious relationship with Ha Ri.

180
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:12.900
Be strong.

181
00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:15.929
I'll have some red ginseng...

182
00:12:16.929 --> 00:12:18.699
to give me extra strength.

183
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.589
Guys, sleep at home.

184
00:12:52.539 --> 00:12:54.600
- Good night. - Go home.

185
00:12:55.169 --> 00:12:56.410
Good work. Go home.

186
00:12:57.469 --> 00:12:58.480
Go home.

187
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.480
(I Sang)

188
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:11.789
Let's go home.

189
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.699
You must be exhausted. Get plenty of rest.

190
00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:25.740
Bye.

191
00:13:27.969 --> 00:13:29.169
Sleep tight.

192
00:13:30.969 --> 00:13:32.240
Wait.

193
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.480
Would you change a light bulb for me?

194
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.620
Which light bulb?

195
00:13:52.146 --> 00:13:55.416
All the light bulbs in the house are so bright,

196
00:13:55.416 --> 00:13:57.087
that it's blinding.

197
00:13:57.087 --> 00:13:59.327
Which light bulb are you asking him to change?

198
00:13:59.357 --> 00:14:01.626
I mean the one in my bedroom.

199
00:14:01.626 --> 00:14:02.927
It's blinking.

200
00:14:04.626 --> 00:14:05.626
I mean it.

201
00:14:07.496 --> 00:14:10.036
- Let's go. I'll change it. - Freeze.

202
00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:13.307
Retreat one step.

203
00:14:13.307 --> 00:14:15.477
Aren't you too old even to be in the reserves?

204
00:14:15.807 --> 00:14:18.077
I'm very wary of perverts...

205
00:14:18.646 --> 00:14:20.376
since I was in the military police.

206
00:14:21.947 --> 00:14:25.317
I'm wary of injuries since I was a medical officer.

207
00:14:26.386 --> 00:14:29.057
And I'm wary of jerks who interfere with my relationships...

208
00:14:29.057 --> 00:14:30.687
since I am an old maid.

209
00:14:30.687 --> 00:14:32.957
Check your surroundings. Auntie is still up.

210
00:14:34.587 --> 00:14:36.796
Go and tell her. She'll be delighted.

211
00:14:39.026 --> 00:14:41.496
You must be tired from pulling all-nighters for two nights.

212
00:14:41.496 --> 00:14:45.067
Rest up. I'll change that light bulb another time.

213
00:14:45.766 --> 00:14:46.967
Get home safely.

214
00:14:47.607 --> 00:14:48.776
I'll deal with you later.

215
00:14:52.876 --> 00:14:54.046
Goodnight.

216
00:15:03.416 --> 00:15:04.987
- Where are you going? - Let go.

217
00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:06.386
- What? - I let go.

218
00:15:06.386 --> 00:15:07.656
- Don't touch me. - Okay.

219
00:15:08.087 --> 00:15:09.526
I'm a scary man.

220
00:15:10.697 --> 00:15:11.766
Go in.

221
00:15:12.827 --> 00:15:14.026
Gosh.

222
00:15:14.796 --> 00:15:15.866
Gosh.

223
00:15:19.366 --> 00:15:22.636
Hey. You'll wake the baby. Walk quietly.

224
00:15:23.006 --> 00:15:24.107
Ha Ri's home.

225
00:15:26.477 --> 00:15:28.746
I should bring her the stew, right?

226
00:15:28.746 --> 00:15:31.317
I'll bring it to her tomorrow. Let her sleep.

227
00:15:31.317 --> 00:15:34.116
She looked incredibly famished.

228
00:15:34.546 --> 00:15:37.557
Really? Then I'll set a table...

229
00:15:49.396 --> 00:15:51.567
That punk Jae Young.

230
00:15:51.567 --> 00:15:53.337
- I'll have a nightmare about him. - Ha Ri.

231
00:15:53.337 --> 00:15:55.136
Be patient.

232
00:15:55.437 --> 00:15:56.807
Seriously.

233
00:16:03.447 --> 00:16:05.746
Don't come here unless it's an emergency.

234
00:16:05.746 --> 00:16:07.516
The rule is, I go downstairs.

235
00:16:08.386 --> 00:16:11.557
The stew is so delicious, it's an emergency. Try it.

236
00:16:11.557 --> 00:16:12.857
You're craving a drink, aren't you?

237
00:16:13.427 --> 00:16:14.626
I quit drinking.

238
00:16:15.197 --> 00:16:16.597
Like that's possible.

239
00:16:17.597 --> 00:16:19.097
Do you want a drink?

240
00:16:19.567 --> 00:16:21.296
Forget it. I'm exhausted.

241
00:16:26.207 --> 00:16:29.207
Hey, so... Why are you so busy?

242
00:16:30.077 --> 00:16:31.947
Why are you so tired?

243
00:16:32.077 --> 00:16:35.116
Are you always this busy or is it this month?

244
00:16:35.416 --> 00:16:38.177
We do have several specials this month, and...

245
00:16:39.217 --> 00:16:41.246
it's my first month as editor-in-chief.

246
00:16:41.856 --> 00:16:43.856
I'll buy you a gift to congratulate you on your promotion.

247
00:16:43.957 --> 00:16:45.286
Forget it.

248
00:16:45.286 --> 00:16:48.596
You're going to try to take double of what you give me.

249
00:16:48.627 --> 00:16:50.657
What do you take me for?

250
00:16:51.157 --> 00:16:54.596
Hey. I've quit drinking now.

251
00:16:54.796 --> 00:16:57.197
I've gotten better at watching Do Ah and am good to Auntie.

252
00:16:57.667 --> 00:17:00.207
I'll be good to you too, so just say the word.

253
00:17:00.336 --> 00:17:02.977
What you want, what you want to do, everything.

254
00:17:03.977 --> 00:17:05.036
What?

255
00:17:07.346 --> 00:17:08.477
Are you sleeping?

256
00:17:14.016 --> 00:17:15.516
Sleep in your room.

257
00:19:17.207 --> 00:19:20.046
Left. Right. Left. Right. Slide.

258
00:19:20.576 --> 00:19:22.246
1, 2, 3, 4.

259
00:19:23.877 --> 00:19:25.387
1, 2, 3, 4.

260
00:19:25.546 --> 00:19:26.816
Side to side.

261
00:19:27.217 --> 00:19:29.056
1, 2, 3, 4.

262
00:19:35.556 --> 00:19:36.697
Slide forward.

263
00:19:42.137 --> 00:19:43.237
Slide forward.

264
00:19:51.637 --> 00:19:53.877
- Thank you. - You did great.

265
00:19:53.877 --> 00:19:54.907
- Bye. - Bye.

266
00:19:54.907 --> 00:19:56.947
- Thank you. - Bye.

267
00:19:58.987 --> 00:20:01.586
We meet on the weekends too, so come if you have time.

268
00:20:01.816 --> 00:20:04.217
Aerobics is the best aerobic exercise.

269
00:20:04.887 --> 00:20:05.987
Is it?

270
00:20:06.556 --> 00:20:09.996
I needed to start doing aerobic exercise anyway.

271
00:20:10.096 --> 00:20:11.727
- How perfect. - Yes.

272
00:20:11.897 --> 00:20:14.266
I started because my health was failing,

273
00:20:14.566 --> 00:20:18.036
but I got healthier and it was exciting, so I got licensed.

274
00:20:19.907 --> 00:20:22.036
Growing old is sad.

275
00:20:22.177 --> 00:20:25.306
Being sick is the saddest.

276
00:20:29.016 --> 00:20:32.586
Do you know why grandparents are so wise?

277
00:20:34.786 --> 00:20:35.917
No.

278
00:20:36.887 --> 00:20:38.387
Because they're "senior" citizens.

279
00:20:40.086 --> 00:20:43.356
What was that? Oh my gosh. You're so funny. What was that?

280
00:20:44.157 --> 00:20:45.197
Really?

281
00:20:45.897 --> 00:20:47.967
I've never had anyone laugh at that before.

282
00:20:48.066 --> 00:20:50.766
Why not? It's hilarious. My gosh.

283
00:20:50.967 --> 00:20:55.737
I guess the two of us click.

284
00:20:56.377 --> 00:20:57.506
Yes, I think you're right.

285
00:20:58.207 --> 00:20:59.707
Are things going well with your girlfriend?

286
00:21:00.447 --> 00:21:01.546
Yes.

287
00:21:02.377 --> 00:21:04.746
I want to meet her every day.

288
00:21:04.947 --> 00:21:07.586
But it's hard to do that. Other than that, it's all good.

289
00:21:08.346 --> 00:21:10.157
I see. When things are going well,

290
00:21:10.157 --> 00:21:11.987
it's easy to think that it's meant to be.

291
00:21:12.487 --> 00:21:14.086
But after some time, I realized...

292
00:21:15.026 --> 00:21:17.096
that you're not always right about fate.

293
00:21:18.867 --> 00:21:20.566
What? "Fate"?

294
00:21:21.467 --> 00:21:25.606
Don't get too upset if things don't work out with your girlfriend.

295
00:21:26.167 --> 00:21:29.977
Who knows? You might be destined to marry my daughter.

296
00:21:33.677 --> 00:21:35.006
The successor?

297
00:21:35.207 --> 00:21:37.346
She'll be getting a huge building.

298
00:21:43.756 --> 00:21:46.756
- I should go now. - Okay.

299
00:21:46.756 --> 00:21:47.756
Go on.

300
00:21:47.756 --> 00:21:50.296
Okay, bye then.

301
00:21:55.066 --> 00:21:56.536
(Clinic for Pediatrics and Adolescents)

302
00:21:56.536 --> 00:22:00.407
How is the old restaurant nearby? Do they sell good food?

303
00:22:04.106 --> 00:22:05.177
Haven't you tried?

304
00:22:05.647 --> 00:22:07.346
Someone's here for you.

305
00:22:10.977 --> 00:22:12.487
I guess I came right on time.

306
00:22:12.947 --> 00:22:14.187
Let's eat lunch together.

307
00:22:18.586 --> 00:22:20.887
I want to stop hating you.

308
00:22:22.627 --> 00:22:23.927
I'm the one at fault.

309
00:22:24.556 --> 00:22:26.697
- That's why I'm clinging onto you. - No.

310
00:22:27.727 --> 00:22:29.637
You still don't think you did anything wrong.

311
00:22:29.637 --> 00:22:31.697
I'm also human. I feel guilty.

312
00:22:31.836 --> 00:22:33.907
I know I'm not the best mom, but I'm still a mom.

313
00:22:33.907 --> 00:22:36.407
Then even so, you never once came to see Do Ah.

314
00:22:39.677 --> 00:22:41.506
I didn't know how to face her.

315
00:22:45.276 --> 00:22:46.417
Jeong Won.

316
00:22:50.957 --> 00:22:52.627
I like someone else.

317
00:22:54.657 --> 00:22:57.296
You're not the type to cling onto me like this.

318
00:22:58.996 --> 00:23:00.667
Just forget about me and Do Ah.

319
00:23:04.467 --> 00:23:07.006
Maybe it's because I'm still in love with you.

320
00:23:09.576 --> 00:23:11.907
But it feels like you're just mistaken about your feelings.

321
00:23:14.076 --> 00:23:17.947
If I'm wrong, and Ha Ri also loves you back,

322
00:23:19.746 --> 00:23:21.016
I'll give up on you.

323
00:23:30.627 --> 00:23:32.927
My gosh, it's so hot.

324
00:23:33.326 --> 00:23:34.727
My goodness, look at my face.

325
00:23:34.727 --> 00:23:36.566
- Where are you going? - Gosh, you startled me.

326
00:23:39.207 --> 00:23:42.137
I thought you'd be in your room for the entire four days.

327
00:23:43.677 --> 00:23:44.907
The weather is nice.

328
00:23:45.407 --> 00:23:46.576
I'm going to get some sunlight.

329
00:23:47.647 --> 00:23:49.447
- Should I go with you? - No, I want to go alone.

330
00:23:50.677 --> 00:23:53.846
Okay, I'll let you have fun on your own today.

331
00:23:54.016 --> 00:23:56.157
But I want to see this guy soon.

332
00:23:59.026 --> 00:24:02.697
My gosh, if you wanted to hide it, you should've told me I'm wrong.

333
00:24:03.526 --> 00:24:04.596
What?

334
00:24:05.796 --> 00:24:07.967
I don't trust your taste in men.

335
00:24:07.967 --> 00:24:10.167
Bring him home. I need to meet him to be sure.

336
00:24:10.266 --> 00:24:11.796
No.

337
00:24:11.937 --> 00:24:14.967
You're just going to scare him away by talking about marriage.

338
00:24:15.536 --> 00:24:17.437
Why are you so relaxed?

339
00:24:17.437 --> 00:24:20.246
I can't even sleep at night because I'm so worried.

340
00:24:20.907 --> 00:24:22.877
You just wait.

341
00:24:23.576 --> 00:24:25.647
I know you're in a hurry, but let me date him first.

342
00:24:26.187 --> 00:24:27.987
Mom, I need to meet him now.

343
00:24:28.346 --> 00:24:29.487
See you.

344
00:24:31.957 --> 00:24:34.187
My gosh, look at you.

345
00:24:34.356 --> 00:24:36.197
Look at you all excited again.

346
00:24:39.826 --> 00:24:40.967
How pretty.

347
00:24:41.627 --> 00:24:43.167
I hope he's a decent guy.

348
00:24:45.036 --> 00:24:47.237
Look at all these lights.

349
00:24:47.336 --> 00:24:48.506
Doesn't it feel like outer space?

350
00:24:50.377 --> 00:24:51.437
Would you please...

351
00:24:59.717 --> 00:25:01.846
This is a nice place to take photos.

352
00:25:01.846 --> 00:25:03.256
- Yes, I agree. - It's pretty.

353
00:25:03.417 --> 00:25:04.586
"Cave Botanic Garden".

354
00:25:05.056 --> 00:25:06.187
It's a botanic garden.

355
00:25:08.996 --> 00:25:11.957
- Doesn't this look like cotton? - You're right.

356
00:25:12.326 --> 00:25:14.167
- Are they real? - Yes, I think so.

357
00:25:15.167 --> 00:25:16.266
This is so cool.

358
00:25:17.096 --> 00:25:19.536
- How interesting. - Can you take a photo for us?

359
00:25:19.667 --> 00:25:22.137
- Sure. I'll take the photo. - Okay, go ahead.

360
00:25:22.776 --> 00:25:25.207
Okay. You guys should gather together.

361
00:25:25.276 --> 00:25:27.177
Gather together.

362
00:25:27.546 --> 00:25:29.076
1, 2, 3.

363
00:25:29.617 --> 00:25:33.016
It's too dark, so come this way.

364
00:25:35.487 --> 00:25:37.586
What's this?

365
00:25:40.556 --> 00:25:42.856
Let me take one more. 1, 2, 3.

366
00:26:02.977 --> 00:26:04.576
I Sang.

367
00:26:36.846 --> 00:26:37.917
Where is she?

368
00:26:42.657 --> 00:26:43.717
(Ha Ri)

369
00:26:50.627 --> 00:26:53.167
My boyfriend is calling me.

370
00:26:53.367 --> 00:26:55.127
- Hello? - Hey, my girlfriend.

371
00:26:56.137 --> 00:26:57.237
Where are you?

372
00:26:57.766 --> 00:26:59.266
Right now, I'm...

373
00:27:03.207 --> 00:27:06.947
Do you think we'll be able to find each other here?

374
00:27:09.217 --> 00:27:11.546
Wait. I'll find you.

375
00:27:12.546 --> 00:27:13.617
Let's hang up.

376
00:27:31.066 --> 00:27:34.106
(Golden Road)

377
00:27:57.727 --> 00:27:59.227
There's my girlfriend!

378
00:28:00.826 --> 00:28:02.637
- My gosh. - Gosh, my legs hurt.

379
00:28:02.637 --> 00:28:03.737
- Let's sit down. - Why don't we sit down?

380
00:28:04.996 --> 00:28:06.566
- Goodness. - My gosh.

381
00:28:07.967 --> 00:28:10.836
I guess we're too used to doing things alone.

382
00:28:11.407 --> 00:28:12.977
- Right? - Do you think so?

383
00:28:13.947 --> 00:28:16.776
From now on, let's grow a habit...

384
00:28:16.877 --> 00:28:18.877
of doing everything together.

385
00:28:20.217 --> 00:28:21.816
I can't believe you found me though.

386
00:28:22.286 --> 00:28:23.487
Was it too easy?

387
00:28:23.756 --> 00:28:25.687
I wanted to test our fate.

388
00:28:27.086 --> 00:28:28.356
It wasn't too hard.

389
00:28:28.657 --> 00:28:31.826
I just followed my hunch,

390
00:28:31.927 --> 00:28:33.127
and you were there.

391
00:28:36.036 --> 00:28:39.106
The fact that I was able to find you so easily...

392
00:28:39.106 --> 00:28:41.137
inside this huge cave...

393
00:28:41.407 --> 00:28:42.776
means that we're meant to be.

394
00:28:44.036 --> 00:28:46.977
To be honest, fate might not even exist.

395
00:28:47.477 --> 00:28:48.947
But when you're in love,

396
00:28:49.717 --> 00:28:52.046
you just want to believe that you're destined for each other.

397
00:28:52.746 --> 00:28:53.917
Maybe...

398
00:28:55.187 --> 00:28:57.717
people use the word "fate"...

399
00:28:57.987 --> 00:29:00.086
because they don't want...

400
00:29:00.727 --> 00:29:02.056
to break up with each other.

401
00:29:03.496 --> 00:29:05.996
- Do you think so? - Forget it if I'm wrong.

402
00:29:13.306 --> 00:29:14.606
What do you want to do now?

403
00:29:15.306 --> 00:29:16.437
Do you want to eat?

404
00:29:17.137 --> 00:29:18.606
What do you want to do?

405
00:29:21.477 --> 00:29:23.576
I want to do what you want to do.

406
00:29:25.076 --> 00:29:27.286
Don't always do everything I want.

407
00:29:28.717 --> 00:29:30.316
Then you'll think it's unfair later on...

408
00:29:30.687 --> 00:29:32.387
because it might feel like you're the only one sacrificing yourself.

409
00:29:34.356 --> 00:29:35.727
I'm not sacrificing myself.

410
00:29:36.496 --> 00:29:37.796
I just want to be more like you.

411
00:29:38.927 --> 00:29:41.566
I've lived all my life doing what I want.

412
00:29:42.467 --> 00:29:44.796
So now, I want to do stuff that you like to do.

413
00:29:46.266 --> 00:29:47.737
That way, I'll learn more about you.

414
00:29:48.806 --> 00:29:52.437
Then let's take turns doing what we want to do.

415
00:29:52.977 --> 00:29:54.477
I also need to learn more about you.

416
00:30:02.417 --> 00:30:03.617
But are you sure?

417
00:30:06.957 --> 00:30:10.397
What if your kindness only makes me expect more from you?

418
00:30:13.627 --> 00:30:17.096
Give someone an inch, and you get a ruler.

419
00:30:25.677 --> 00:30:26.776
Sorry.

420
00:30:27.677 --> 00:30:30.046
Gosh, your dad jokes are still so hard to get.

421
00:30:30.647 --> 00:30:32.417
But I'm sure I'll find it funny one day.

422
00:30:32.647 --> 00:30:35.957
Well, this is pretty much it.

423
00:30:35.957 --> 00:30:37.016
No.

424
00:30:38.717 --> 00:30:43.056
But it's nice that we'll slowly get used to one another.

425
00:30:48.127 --> 00:30:49.266
The thing is...

426
00:30:56.536 --> 00:30:59.806
It's why I've been trying to like the idea of kids.

427
00:31:04.816 --> 00:31:07.846
I know where you stand on this matter,

428
00:31:12.687 --> 00:31:14.627
but I...

429
00:31:16.927 --> 00:31:18.026
You see,

430
00:31:18.897 --> 00:31:22.526
I haven't been fond of children because...

431
00:31:22.697 --> 00:31:25.137
- Get your beondegi! - It's because of beondegi.

432
00:31:27.536 --> 00:31:29.207
Get your beondegi!

433
00:31:33.677 --> 00:31:35.606
Anyway,

434
00:31:36.417 --> 00:31:39.987
the reason I wasn't fond of children...

435
00:31:39.987 --> 00:31:42.387
- Get your ice pops! - It's because of ice pops.

436
00:31:42.657 --> 00:31:44.657
Get your ice pops!

437
00:31:47.756 --> 00:31:50.697
So what I'm saying is that...

438
00:31:51.427 --> 00:31:52.457
Yes?

439
00:31:53.496 --> 00:31:54.826
It's because...

440
00:31:54.826 --> 00:31:56.697
- Mister! - It's the mister...

441
00:31:56.697 --> 00:31:59.367
- I want one. - Me too!

442
00:31:59.367 --> 00:32:01.536
That's right. I'm a mister.

443
00:32:01.536 --> 00:32:03.576
I should be called that since I'm old.

444
00:32:03.576 --> 00:32:06.346
- Mister! - Over here.

445
00:32:10.447 --> 00:32:11.647
Anyway,

446
00:32:13.117 --> 00:32:14.717
just know that I don't hate kids.

447
00:32:26.266 --> 00:32:27.566
I know, all right?

448
00:32:28.627 --> 00:32:30.836
There's no need to glare at me like that.

449
00:32:31.096 --> 00:32:32.667
I'm going to tell her.

450
00:32:32.937 --> 00:32:35.006
It's not easy to say, you know.

451
00:32:38.207 --> 00:32:40.346
She'll be shocked, right?

452
00:32:40.447 --> 00:32:41.546
The truth will hurt her.

453
00:32:41.846 --> 00:32:44.776
What if she thinks that I've been deceiving her?

454
00:32:50.617 --> 00:32:51.786
I'm...

455
00:32:53.127 --> 00:32:54.957
terrified of...

456
00:32:56.596 --> 00:32:58.026
losing her.

457
00:33:27.026 --> 00:33:28.756
- Is Mom asleep? - Yes.

458
00:33:37.867 --> 00:33:40.667
Jae Young, Mom found out.

459
00:33:41.306 --> 00:33:43.776
If she asks about I Sang, say you don't know anything...

460
00:33:44.237 --> 00:33:45.436
instead of bad-mouthing him.

461
00:33:48.347 --> 00:33:51.117
What is it? Is something up?

462
00:33:53.747 --> 00:33:56.816
What do you think would've happened to us...

463
00:33:56.816 --> 00:33:58.057
had I not married Jeong Won?

464
00:33:58.356 --> 00:34:00.157
We'd be sitting here just like this. Why?

465
00:34:02.586 --> 00:34:04.296
Do you regret dating and marrying her?

466
00:34:06.126 --> 00:34:07.267
Yes.

467
00:34:08.997 --> 00:34:10.836
I think I lost...

468
00:34:11.137 --> 00:34:13.836
my real shot at life because of her.

469
00:34:18.177 --> 00:34:21.506
How could you have forgotten about your undying love for each other?

470
00:34:22.106 --> 00:34:23.617
It's still clear as day in my head.

471
00:34:25.517 --> 00:34:27.146
I heard a lot about you...

472
00:34:27.146 --> 00:34:28.787
and was wondering when he'd introduce me to you.

473
00:34:29.517 --> 00:34:30.657
You're pretty.

474
00:34:31.517 --> 00:34:32.557
Sorry?

475
00:34:32.927 --> 00:34:34.487
You never said she was pretty.

476
00:34:34.756 --> 00:34:37.456
Her? I guess she has a face...

477
00:34:37.726 --> 00:34:40.396
with eyes, a nose,

478
00:34:40.396 --> 00:34:41.726
and a mouth.

479
00:34:41.867 --> 00:34:44.436
I wouldn't call her pretty.

480
00:34:44.896 --> 00:34:46.336
Are you kidding me?

481
00:34:48.467 --> 00:34:51.137
I'm sorry about that. I didn't mean much.

482
00:34:52.376 --> 00:34:54.276
Why would you apologize?

483
00:34:54.407 --> 00:34:56.077
If you had to apologize,

484
00:34:56.476 --> 00:34:59.947
it would be for the fact that your beauty is blinding.

485
00:35:00.117 --> 00:35:03.456
My gosh. You're embarrassing me in front of your friend.

486
00:35:03.456 --> 00:35:05.256
Why would you be when it's the truth?

487
00:35:07.557 --> 00:35:10.296
You two acted like you were the only people...

488
00:35:10.296 --> 00:35:11.997
on this planet.

489
00:35:13.497 --> 00:35:14.666
Jae Young.

490
00:35:15.126 --> 00:35:17.566
What you lost and regret...

491
00:35:17.597 --> 00:35:19.296
is a part of your life.

492
00:35:19.637 --> 00:35:21.967
Even if you go back in time, you'll still choose her.

493
00:35:23.577 --> 00:35:25.237
I don't need to turn back time...

494
00:35:26.006 --> 00:35:27.807
since I know what I did wrong.

495
00:35:27.807 --> 00:35:30.177
You should've known when you had the chance.

496
00:35:32.747 --> 00:35:35.347
I loved Jeong Won to death.

497
00:35:36.956 --> 00:35:38.557
If I had done better,

498
00:35:38.756 --> 00:35:40.987
she wouldn't have left me.

499
00:35:41.626 --> 00:35:44.497
I have thought of that over and over again.

500
00:35:46.396 --> 00:35:47.726
But now,

501
00:35:50.237 --> 00:35:52.336
I don't see her anymore.

502
00:35:55.537 --> 00:35:57.237
I guess that's how selfish...

503
00:35:58.836 --> 00:36:00.347
one's heart is.

504
00:36:17.097 --> 00:36:18.097
What's going on?

505
00:36:18.856 --> 00:36:20.026
Is everyone outside the office?

506
00:36:20.867 --> 00:36:22.526
Yes, to search for new ideas.

507
00:36:24.697 --> 00:36:26.637
Which means they're out having fun.

508
00:36:28.367 --> 00:36:29.506
What did the executives say?

509
00:36:30.407 --> 00:36:32.606
I was given an earful for the decrease in sales.

510
00:36:33.807 --> 00:36:35.646
They want a better model on the cover too.

511
00:36:38.316 --> 00:36:39.717
What about Kang Hyo Joo?

512
00:36:40.617 --> 00:36:43.487
It'd be great for us, but she'd never agree to it.

513
00:36:44.717 --> 00:36:46.887
The feature we did on infertility...

514
00:36:46.887 --> 00:36:49.387
led to many asking about ovulation-inducing agents.

515
00:36:49.526 --> 00:36:50.827
We should write a piece on it sometime.

516
00:36:51.356 --> 00:36:55.226
Sounds good. Many are suffering from infertility these days.

517
00:36:56.967 --> 00:36:57.967
Go ahead with it.

518
00:36:58.166 --> 00:36:59.706
There are regulations when it comes to pharmaceuticals,

519
00:36:59.706 --> 00:37:02.436
so get me a list before publishing anything.

520
00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:03.677
Sure thing.

521
00:37:04.677 --> 00:37:06.237
Then...

522
00:37:06.506 --> 00:37:08.947
I'll head out in search of a new item too.

523
00:37:08.976 --> 00:37:10.247
Sure, have fun.

524
00:37:11.517 --> 00:37:12.677
- You too. - Hello.

525
00:37:12.677 --> 00:37:13.987
Have a good day.

526
00:37:14.747 --> 00:37:16.557
Yes, Eu Ddeum. Is there a meeting?

527
00:37:16.756 --> 00:37:17.987
Are you free on Saturday?

528
00:37:19.057 --> 00:37:21.657
Something will probably come up. Why?

529
00:37:21.756 --> 00:37:24.026
Could that something be with me?

530
00:37:24.356 --> 00:37:26.526
I'm afraid that seems highly unlikely.

531
00:37:27.367 --> 00:37:29.066
Are you talking about that meal you offered?

532
00:37:29.526 --> 00:37:31.666
Yes, you must make time for me that day.

533
00:37:31.666 --> 00:37:32.936
I'll call you on Saturday.

534
00:37:33.336 --> 00:37:35.767
But Eu Ddeum... No, wait.

535
00:37:38.436 --> 00:37:40.907
Why on earth did he have to choose me as his mentor?

536
00:37:42.046 --> 00:37:43.717
This isn't good.

537
00:37:48.847 --> 00:37:50.887
Who did you have lunch with today?

538
00:37:52.117 --> 00:37:53.557
Mr. Kim treated me.

539
00:37:53.557 --> 00:37:56.657
He rarely buys meals, but he wanted to thank me...

540
00:37:56.657 --> 00:37:58.356
for getting the autographed CD.

541
00:37:58.827 --> 00:38:00.396
He owed you then.

542
00:38:01.697 --> 00:38:03.296
What do your parents do?

543
00:38:03.597 --> 00:38:05.896
Do you have any siblings?

544
00:38:06.097 --> 00:38:07.367
Where do you live?

545
00:38:09.106 --> 00:38:11.276
A small studio apartment. What's this meeting about though?

546
00:38:12.737 --> 00:38:14.347
It's a socializing session.

547
00:38:14.577 --> 00:38:17.617
We've been working together more often these days,

548
00:38:17.617 --> 00:38:19.847
so we should know more about each other...

549
00:38:19.847 --> 00:38:22.186
in order to work better as a team.

550
00:38:23.956 --> 00:38:25.356
So...

551
00:38:26.927 --> 00:38:28.856
Did you figure out...

552
00:38:29.956 --> 00:38:31.396
the ring size?

553
00:38:35.126 --> 00:38:36.997
I discreetly had it measured.

554
00:38:37.296 --> 00:38:39.166
You're more meticulous that I thought.

555
00:38:40.137 --> 00:38:43.376
Then when will you confess your feelings?

556
00:38:45.606 --> 00:38:47.347
This Saturday.

557
00:38:49.276 --> 00:38:50.316
Got it.

558
00:38:51.146 --> 00:38:53.316
- Sorry? - I heard you loud and clear.

559
00:39:10.037 --> 00:39:11.896
Consider this as a career-defining moment...

560
00:39:11.896 --> 00:39:14.506
and make me look the loveliest as possible.

561
00:39:15.936 --> 00:39:17.237
Sorry?

562
00:39:17.506 --> 00:39:20.046
How I look today will be imprinted on...

563
00:39:20.046 --> 00:39:21.847
a guy's memory forever.

564
00:39:24.617 --> 00:39:26.586
- Welcome. - Hello.

565
00:39:27.146 --> 00:39:29.186
I'm here to buy the C brand ring.

566
00:39:29.287 --> 00:39:30.717
The C brand?

567
00:39:33.887 --> 00:39:35.927
These are the rings you picked out.

568
00:39:36.126 --> 00:39:37.927
Are these by the C brand?

569
00:39:38.057 --> 00:39:39.356
That's right.

570
00:39:41.296 --> 00:39:43.066
I'd like one in this size, please.

571
00:40:09.256 --> 00:40:12.026
Ms. Jang, could we meet right now?

572
00:40:12.427 --> 00:40:14.126
I'm at Jo Jo's Restaurant.

573
00:40:15.066 --> 00:40:16.166
Really?

574
00:40:16.767 --> 00:40:18.097
I'm at Jo Jo's Restaurant too.

575
00:40:18.537 --> 00:40:20.267
Just a second then. I'll...

576
00:40:41.081 --> 00:40:42.411
I...

577
00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.650
You're playing a game, right?

578
00:40:49.491 --> 00:40:51.520
Yes, we were arm-wrestling.

579
00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.101
Well... We're...

580
00:41:00.301 --> 00:41:01.400
dating.

581
00:41:03.371 --> 00:41:04.701
- Sorry? - Well...

582
00:41:05.601 --> 00:41:07.741
Please don't tell Mr. Kim.

583
00:41:07.741 --> 00:41:09.840
He's a human megaphone.

584
00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.710
Hi, Eu Ddeum.

585
00:41:12.011 --> 00:41:13.181
I'll pull up a chair for you.

586
00:41:13.551 --> 00:41:15.210
Thank you.

587
00:41:15.351 --> 00:41:16.980
Have... Have a seat.

588
00:41:19.581 --> 00:41:22.750
- Eu Ddeum? - Sit...

589
00:41:23.391 --> 00:41:25.491
Eu Ddeum? Where are you going?

590
00:41:53.351 --> 00:41:57.520
If Eu Ddeum asks you to meet alone, don't.

591
00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.761
Especially if he says he'll show you his Bongsan mask dance.

592
00:42:02.161 --> 00:42:04.701
Is he an advocate of the Bongsan mask dance?

593
00:42:05.201 --> 00:42:06.261
I want to see it.

594
00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:09.801
If you want to see it, I'll learn...

595
00:42:09.801 --> 00:42:11.040
the Bongsan mask dance.

596
00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.701
- Put that away. - Yes, ma'am.

597
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.511
Well...

598
00:42:17.311 --> 00:42:20.380
Is it okay that Eu Ddeum finds out...

599
00:42:20.851 --> 00:42:22.150
about us?

600
00:42:22.351 --> 00:42:25.681
He's so kind and pure at heart. He won't tell anyone.

601
00:42:26.221 --> 00:42:28.391
Don't you worry.

602
00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:31.061
Everyone at the company knows except for Mr. Kim.

603
00:42:31.761 --> 00:42:32.891
They do?

604
00:42:32.891 --> 00:42:35.761
Of course. We're not blind.

605
00:42:35.931 --> 00:42:38.101
Don't be all touchy if you want to hide it.

606
00:42:38.201 --> 00:42:40.900
You should just go public.

607
00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.900
We've worked hard trying to hide it.

608
00:42:44.570 --> 00:42:46.000
- Thank you. - Thank you.

609
00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.641
- Your usual, right? - Yes.

610
00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.440
I didn't think we were that obvious.

611
00:42:55.681 --> 00:42:57.150
There are many people to manage.

612
00:42:57.721 --> 00:42:58.820
Manage?

613
00:42:59.750 --> 00:43:02.991
Will Jae Young keep living with you?

614
00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:05.790
Until he moves out voluntarily.

615
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:09.661
My mom thinks of him as her real son.

616
00:43:09.790 --> 00:43:12.801
I'm sure it must bother you, but just ignore him.

617
00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.130
He's just trying to act like my big brother.

618
00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:17.641
He thinks he's a human barricade.

619
00:43:18.301 --> 00:43:19.440
Don't mind him.

620
00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.210
Okay, I won't.

621
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.411
So? Beer after we eat?

622
00:43:24.411 --> 00:43:25.511
Sounds good.

623
00:43:59.911 --> 00:44:02.081
(Dachae Ads Choi Kang Eu Ddeum)

624
00:44:04.781 --> 00:44:07.090
The person you have reached...

625
00:44:12.391 --> 00:44:13.790
Why isn't he picking up?

626
00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.750
Is it good?

627
00:45:10.781 --> 00:45:12.980
(Punk Jae Young)

628
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.621
Hey.

629
00:45:15.621 --> 00:45:17.491
Hey. Where are you?

630
00:45:17.661 --> 00:45:18.761
Me?

631
00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:21.431
At a bar near home. Why?

632
00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:22.831
Want me to bring you something?

633
00:45:22.831 --> 00:45:24.500
Why would I want anything?

634
00:45:31.641 --> 00:45:32.741
Hey.

635
00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.170
What...

636
00:45:36.911 --> 00:45:39.781
We said we'd have one drink, but how many is this already?

637
00:45:40.581 --> 00:45:42.911
Did you taste this? Did you?

638
00:45:43.081 --> 00:45:44.150
It's bland...

639
00:45:46.951 --> 00:45:48.650
Ding.

640
00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:51.991
Only I'm drunk.

641
00:45:53.121 --> 00:45:55.761
It has been a while. Hi there.

642
00:45:57.431 --> 00:45:58.531
Yes.

643
00:45:59.261 --> 00:46:00.431
Should I take you home?

644
00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.871
Do you want to come over?

645
00:46:10.210 --> 00:46:11.440
No.

646
00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.110
You were right about the light bulbs, but this is really not that.

647
00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.320
I want to take you to my place...

648
00:46:22.551 --> 00:46:24.590
right this instant.

649
00:46:27.061 --> 00:46:28.460
You should...

650
00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.661
speed on the Autobahn,

651
00:46:32.801 --> 00:46:36.201
but I can't speed with you.

652
00:46:37.741 --> 00:46:38.801
Autobahn?

653
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:42.770
What?

654
00:46:43.411 --> 00:46:46.681
You and I are driving at different speeds.

655
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:49.311
So we'll get into an accident.

656
00:46:50.581 --> 00:46:52.081
What do you mean?

657
00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:58.590
Don't try to find out why. Don't.

658
00:47:07.831 --> 00:47:09.670
The ramen smells good.

659
00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.601
Want some ramen?

660
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:17.940
- Do you want? - Ramen?

661
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.710
Which ramen?

662
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:21.911
Spicy? Seafood? Cup noodles?

663
00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:23.351
What?

664
00:47:23.951 --> 00:47:25.121
A beer please.

665
00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:32.920
I came out for a short walk.

666
00:47:34.431 --> 00:47:36.331
You had a lot of beer.

667
00:47:37.101 --> 00:47:39.900
Hey. Get home already.

668
00:47:40.971 --> 00:47:42.070
Just one, please.

669
00:47:45.141 --> 00:47:47.340
Hey. Ha Ri.

670
00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:51.811
Do you want to have ramen at my place?

671
00:48:01.491 --> 00:48:03.891
I'll go. I like ramen.

672
00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:06.121
Make me black bean ramen with ribeye.

673
00:48:06.391 --> 00:48:08.290
Are all three of us going? Let's go alone.

674
00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:09.460
Good, right?

675
00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:11.331
Why? Can't we go alone?

676
00:48:11.761 --> 00:48:13.661
Why? Can't we go alone?

677
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.130
I want to go alone with you.

678
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:17.900
Let's finish our drinks and go.

679
00:48:27.451 --> 00:48:29.781
- Do you want some too? - No.

680
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.520
Are you having ramen this late?

681
00:48:34.051 --> 00:48:35.520
I suddenly wanted some.

682
00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:49.871
You said you didn't want any.

683
00:48:50.701 --> 00:48:52.601
Did you actually believe me?

684
00:48:52.601 --> 00:48:55.411
Did you or did you not know that I'd ask for a bite?

685
00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:58.741
One of these days, I'm going to punch you so hard.

686
00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:04.221
Auntie. She was out drinking...

687
00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.520
and was about to go to a guy's place to have ramen.

688
00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:08.690
Stop it.

689
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:10.860
So?

690
00:49:12.391 --> 00:49:15.790
Going to a guy's place to have ramen means...

691
00:49:16.031 --> 00:49:17.130
You...

692
00:49:19.201 --> 00:49:20.570
He lives alone, right?

693
00:49:21.931 --> 00:49:23.500
That's why I was going to go.

694
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:25.400
I wouldn't go where three generations live together.

695
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.011
Listen to her. Auntie, she's out of control.

696
00:49:28.471 --> 00:49:30.480
Why are you intruding on her personal life?

697
00:49:31.311 --> 00:49:32.380
What?

698
00:49:33.011 --> 00:49:36.150
Is he just trying to get some?

699
00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:39.121
No. He's very cautious.

700
00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:42.150
He won't take me to his place. He won't come into mine either.

701
00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:48.891
Hey. No matter how hungry you are, there is an order to things.

702
00:49:48.991 --> 00:49:51.701
Would you throw in noodles before the water boils?

703
00:49:52.831 --> 00:49:54.471
Our water is already boiling at 100°C.

704
00:49:55.701 --> 00:49:57.971
"100°C"? Then why hasn't he...

705
00:49:57.971 --> 00:49:59.440
done anything yet?

706
00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.710
If he's actually ready, he would've done something by now.

707
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:04.840
That's what a true man would do.

708
00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:06.940
My gosh.

709
00:50:07.951 --> 00:50:11.221
Do you think he feel pressured because he knows I want kids?

710
00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:31.141
Auntie, what if I kept living with her?

711
00:50:32.201 --> 00:50:33.201
You?

712
00:50:33.201 --> 00:50:35.940
I just have to be by her side like I am now.

713
00:50:36.971 --> 00:50:38.210
It's how we've always been.

714
00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:52.360
You should...

715
00:50:53.161 --> 00:50:55.431
speed on the Autobahn,

716
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:59.931
but I can't speed with you.

717
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:04.641
Time is ticking

718
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:06.701
Let's go home.

719
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:09.040
- Okay. - Great job, everyone.

720
00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.011
Good work, everyone.

721
00:51:11.011 --> 00:51:13.440
- See you tomorrow. - See you guys tomorrow.

722
00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:21.590
- So Yoon - Yes?

723
00:51:22.351 --> 00:51:24.590
Do we have any home appliances?

724
00:51:24.621 --> 00:51:26.360
Something that needs to be installed.

725
00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:30.391
I think we recently got some kind of a cleaner.

726
00:51:32.101 --> 00:51:33.860
Let's see. Here it is.

727
00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:34.900
Thanks.

728
00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:14.511
"You're here."

729
00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.690
Just a second.

730
00:52:41.801 --> 00:52:42.871
Come inside.

731
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:57.051
You didn't eat, did you?

732
00:52:57.081 --> 00:52:58.721
It's okay. I already ate.

733
00:52:58.781 --> 00:53:00.721
- Would you like anything? - No, thank you.

734
00:53:31.721 --> 00:53:32.951
Thanks.

735
00:53:35.451 --> 00:53:39.261
What's the device that needs to be installed?

736
00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:40.621
Oh, well...

737
00:53:41.491 --> 00:53:44.500
I thought I'd give this to you...

738
00:53:45.031 --> 00:53:47.061
hoping it'll remind you of me every time you use it.

739
00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:50.400
It's an automatic toilet cleaning device.

740
00:54:03.311 --> 00:54:05.480
- Should I help you? - No, it's okay.

741
00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:14.431
This is an automatic toilet cleaning device.

742
00:54:14.431 --> 00:54:17.500
It sterilizes your toilet, and you don't need to clean...

743
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:20.161
It says you don't need to clean your toilet for an entire year.

744
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:23.701
Are you going to read the whole thing?

745
00:54:23.701 --> 00:54:25.340
I only read three sentences.

746
00:54:32.681 --> 00:54:35.011
Well, it's hard for me...

747
00:54:36.551 --> 00:54:39.150
to think of anything else at this point.

748
00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:44.261
Let me tell you this just in case you feel pressured.

749
00:54:46.621 --> 00:54:48.090
Nothing else is on my mind right now.

750
00:54:49.931 --> 00:54:51.431
Right now,

751
00:54:52.431 --> 00:54:54.670
all I care about is you.

752
00:55:18.891 --> 00:55:22.460
This is an announcement from the Management Office.

753
00:55:22.891 --> 00:55:26.101
Our apartment is a place where kids and teenagers...

754
00:55:26.101 --> 00:55:29.101
can grow up with a sound and healthy mindset.

755
00:55:29.101 --> 00:55:31.570
- Therefore, please do not smoke... - My gosh.

756
00:55:31.570 --> 00:55:33.371
- or be too physical in public. - This is a first.

757
00:55:33.371 --> 00:55:35.871
- I see. - Let me repeat one more time.

758
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:37.741
- Our apartment is a place... - It's just an announcement.

759
00:55:37.741 --> 00:55:39.610
where kids and teenagers...

760
00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:42.781
can grow up with a sound and healthy mindset.

761
00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:45.851
Therefore, please do not smoke or be too physical in public.

762
00:55:45.851 --> 00:55:48.820
Or be too physical... Be too physical...

763
00:55:49.051 --> 00:55:50.920
Physical... Physical...

764
00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:53.561
- Physical... Physical... - This is the Security Office.

765
00:55:54.121 --> 00:55:56.860
- Physical... Physical... - The machine is broken.

766
00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:59.761
- Physical... Physical... - It won't turn off.

767
00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:02.730
- So please bear with it... - Let's do it now.

768
00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:05.040
- Physical... Physical... - for just a little while.

769
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:07.000
- Physical... Physical... - Once again, I apologize.

770
00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.110
- Seriously? Sirens? - Physical... Physical...

771
00:56:09.511 --> 00:56:11.710
- I repeat once again. - I'm sorry, Ha Ri.

772
00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:14.480
- Physical... Physical... - The machine is currently broken.

773
00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.451
- And it won't turn off. - Excuse me. Sir.

774
00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.221
- Sir. - So please bear with it...

775
00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:21.650
- for just a little while. - Physical... Physical...

776
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:22.920
The security guard...

777
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:24.391
in your apartment...

778
00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:25.991
explains things in detail.

779
00:56:26.121 --> 00:56:27.761
Physical... Physical...

780
00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:29.090
Hello? Sir?

781
00:56:47.681 --> 00:56:50.811
Hey, remember that light bulb you mentioned last time?

782
00:56:52.221 --> 00:56:53.951
You haven't changed it yet, have you?

783
00:56:56.190 --> 00:56:57.221
No.

784
00:56:59.161 --> 00:57:01.730
Then should I change it for you?

785
00:57:03.491 --> 00:57:04.761
- Sure. - Let's go.

786
00:57:25.851 --> 00:57:27.121
I'll see you then.

787
00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:29.451
- Bye. - Goodnight.

788
00:57:37.061 --> 00:57:38.500
You're unbelievable.

789
00:57:39.831 --> 00:57:42.601
I seriously can't believe you.

790
00:58:00.081 --> 00:58:01.420
Gosh, what was that?

791
00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:07.320
The bump has gotten a bit bigger.

792
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:09.831
I guess that's why my period cramps hurt even more.

793
00:58:10.130 --> 00:58:11.701
How do you bear with the pain?

794
00:58:12.701 --> 00:58:15.170
We have a few months left until the follow-up.

795
00:58:15.331 --> 00:58:16.730
But are you going to postpone the surgery?

796
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:19.840
Have you seen any progress with your plan?

797
00:58:20.570 --> 00:58:23.940
That plan got canceled.

798
00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:27.281
I have a boyfriend now.

799
00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:31.880
Then I shouldn't be prescribing painkillers for you.

800
00:58:37.491 --> 00:58:39.320
You're about to ovulate, so you're here just in time.

801
00:58:39.761 --> 00:58:42.061
I'll prescribe an injection that will induce your ovulation,

802
00:58:42.061 --> 00:58:45.801
so try your best to get pregnant on your ovulation day.

803
00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:52.471
I know I'm in a rush.

804
00:58:53.371 --> 00:58:56.641
But I don't know how I'm supposed to suddenly sleep with him.

805
00:59:24.371 --> 00:59:31.911
(I wish that Ha Ri's wish will come true no matter what.)

806
00:59:42.351 --> 00:59:47.891
(Ha Ri)

807
00:59:54.801 --> 00:59:57.170
- Hello? - Have you eaten?

808
00:59:58.040 --> 00:59:59.141
Yes.

809
01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:06.011
When do you get off work today?

810
01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:09.011
I don't think I'll need to stick around.

811
01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:12.880
It's just that I have something to say.

812
01:00:15.351 --> 01:00:17.820
Then I'll wait for you outside your office.

813
01:00:18.761 --> 01:00:19.860
Sure.

814
01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:44.051
Here. It's the list of ovulation-inducing agents.

815
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:45.250
I see.

816
01:00:46.181 --> 01:00:47.250
The General Affairs Department...

817
01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:48.920
is asking for the contract with Jambi Studio.

818
01:00:50.451 --> 01:00:52.960
- I think I left it there. - I see.

819
01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:57.590
(List of ovulation-inducing agents)

820
01:01:02.201 --> 01:01:04.000
Auntie, have you seen Do Ah's stroller?

821
01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.170
She wants to take a nap.

822
01:01:05.371 --> 01:01:06.940
It's at the entrance.

823
01:01:07.101 --> 01:01:09.570
- What? - Right over there.

824
01:01:11.311 --> 01:01:13.840
- What... - Did you miss this?

825
01:01:14.581 --> 01:01:17.511
Why on earth did I miss this?

826
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:24.320
Where has your head been lately?

827
01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:30.831
Jae Young,

828
01:01:31.801 --> 01:01:33.900
do you have feelings for Ha Ri?

829
01:01:43.911 --> 01:01:44.980
Yes.

830
01:01:49.511 --> 01:01:50.750
I like her,

831
01:01:52.221 --> 01:01:54.380
but I don't know what to do about it.

832
01:02:01.931 --> 01:02:04.960
Auntie, what should I do?

833
01:02:07.331 --> 01:02:10.130
- So Yoon, could you strike a pose? - Like this?

834
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.371
Yes, we're good. Thanks.

835
01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:17.040
We're doing a piece on signals that lead to a successful time in bed...

836
01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.581
versus a bad one between married couples.

837
01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.980
The shoot requires a shadow of a couple behind the screen.

838
01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.020
Who are you talking to? Me?

839
01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.690
Why would you tell me that?

840
01:02:30.121 --> 01:02:33.561
Because Mr. Nam has to be behind the camera.

841
01:02:37.891 --> 01:02:40.630
We're the only man and woman left...

842
01:02:41.201 --> 01:02:42.570
who can go behind the screen.

843
01:02:42.871 --> 01:02:45.641
Actually, there's me.

844
01:02:49.511 --> 01:02:53.340
This is looking good, but could you step closer to her, I Sang?

845
01:02:53.641 --> 01:02:54.710
- Sure. - Good.

846
01:02:55.181 --> 01:02:56.650
And stop! Right.

847
01:02:56.650 --> 01:02:58.181
Just hold it there.

848
01:03:00.621 --> 01:03:02.150
I have something to ask you.

849
01:03:03.391 --> 01:03:04.551
What is it?

850
01:03:04.551 --> 01:03:07.161
I'm not trying to be pushy or anything.

851
01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:14.130
You're trying to like kids...

852
01:03:14.431 --> 01:03:15.500
because of me, right?

853
01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.681
We're not married...

854
01:03:26.641 --> 01:03:28.880
and we haven't even discussed it,

855
01:03:30.081 --> 01:03:32.750
so I know it's weird to bring this up.

856
01:03:36.121 --> 01:03:39.621
But having a kid is easier for me than marriage.

857
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.561
My kid would instantly join my family...

858
01:03:43.561 --> 01:03:46.101
and I will love it the moment I give birth to it.

859
01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:51.130
But marriage should be with someone whom I'm certain of loving...

860
01:03:51.701 --> 01:03:53.871
until the day I die.

861
01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:58.011
And getting married because of a pregnancy is even worse.

862
01:04:01.411 --> 01:04:02.551
I understand.

863
01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:04.610
But...

864
01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.650
I'm already behind,

865
01:04:09.391 --> 01:04:10.491
so waiting any longer...

866
01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:13.920
will prevent me from having kids all together.

867
01:04:17.491 --> 01:04:19.661
Ms. Jang, could you take a step forward?

868
01:04:23.531 --> 01:04:26.301
I Sang, you too.

869
01:04:29.911 --> 01:04:31.141
Stop.

870
01:04:33.081 --> 01:04:35.851
I had no idea I'd feel this way,

871
01:04:37.451 --> 01:04:39.451
but I want the father of my child...

872
01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:46.621
to be someone I love.

873
01:04:59.371 --> 01:05:00.500
I...

874
01:05:02.371 --> 01:05:03.641
want nothing more...

875
01:05:04.911 --> 01:05:06.141
than to love you.

876
01:05:09.980 --> 01:05:11.110
But...

877
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:28.230
it's difficult for me to have a child.

878
01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:55.061
(List of ovulation-inducing agents)

879
01:06:16.411 --> 01:06:19.150
(Oh My Baby)

880
01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:20.480
What do I do?

881
01:06:20.581 --> 01:06:23.690
Just like me, he suffers from infertility too.

882
01:06:23.891 --> 01:06:26.221
Was that it? You piece of scum.

883
01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:28.230
If that was the case,

884
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:29.730
you shouldn't have started a relationship with her.

885
01:06:29.891 --> 01:06:32.101
If you didn't want to hurt me,

886
01:06:32.531 --> 01:06:33.960
you should've told me sooner.

887
01:06:34.161 --> 01:06:37.371
Let him go. Staying with him will only cause you more pain.

888
01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:39.270
I'll try everything I can,

889
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:41.940
so let's look for a way together.

890
01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.871
What if there's no miracle?

891
01:06:45.011 --> 01:06:48.581
I just don't think I can do this.
