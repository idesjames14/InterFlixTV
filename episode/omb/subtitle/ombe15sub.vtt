00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:14.264
Get in.

2
00:02:21.505 --> 00:02:23.005
Will this do?

3
00:02:23.074 --> 00:02:24.574
I told you we should eat something healthy.

4
00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:27.945
Gosh, it wasn't that big of a surgery.

5
00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:31.854
I mean, look at the food and the view.

6
00:02:32.684 --> 00:02:33.684
There's also you.

7
00:02:34.455 --> 00:02:36.455
I'm surrounded by things that are beautiful,

8
00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:37.625
and that's enough to heal me.

9
00:02:46.565 --> 00:02:47.634
I started...

10
00:02:48.364 --> 00:02:50.565
getting hormonal therapy again.

11
00:02:54.104 --> 00:02:56.505
I've given up on wanting a child, so you can stop getting therapy.

12
00:02:59.174 --> 00:03:01.614
It hurts to see you receive injections...

13
00:03:02.414 --> 00:03:03.644
2 to 3 times every week.

14
00:03:04.715 --> 00:03:05.854
You shouldn't do it anymore.

15
00:03:10.584 --> 00:03:13.195
Did you decide to give up on having a child because of me?

16
00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:21.634
No, I got exhausted.

17
00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:28.245
I'm done getting hurt just because I want a child.

18
00:03:29.104 --> 00:03:30.505
My greed for a child...

19
00:03:32.114 --> 00:03:33.875
only ended up giving you a hard time.

20
00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:39.884
Let's stop having such a hard time.

21
00:03:45.755 --> 00:03:49.565
I agreed to share this dream of yours,

22
00:03:51.234 --> 00:03:52.334
but I let you down.

23
00:03:59.074 --> 00:04:00.805
Do you want to try until we succeed then?

24
00:04:02.544 --> 00:04:04.005
We'll be let down,

25
00:04:04.005 --> 00:04:06.715
but get our hopes up again receiving the treatment.

26
00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:08.685
Until when though?

27
00:04:10.144 --> 00:04:11.914
Until we're too old to try?

28
00:04:15.685 --> 00:04:16.954
Let's not waste...

29
00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:19.424
our precious time...

30
00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:21.995
and enjoy our lives and marriage.

31
00:04:33.975 --> 00:04:38.815
(Episode 15: Love, What Can We Do About It?)

32
00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:44.285
I know I'm being harsh,

33
00:04:44.345 --> 00:04:46.155
but leave my daughter alone.

34
00:04:46.414 --> 00:04:48.755
I don't care if you're blinded by love.

35
00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:52.425
She shouted out to the whole world that she wanted to become a mother.

36
00:04:53.224 --> 00:04:55.894
Know your place and marry someone you're fit for.

37
00:04:55.894 --> 00:04:57.024
How dare you!

38
00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:06.274
Saying that will send me to the underworld.

39
00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:08.904
Not being able to have children isn't some kind of sin anyway.

40
00:05:09.974 --> 00:05:11.675
I can only imagine the pain she felt.

41
00:05:13.644 --> 00:05:16.384
Those poor kids.

42
00:05:25.695 --> 00:05:28.165
Do Ah, your dad will be here soon.

43
00:05:43.704 --> 00:05:45.675
I never thought you were a fuss.

44
00:05:47.144 --> 00:05:48.784
Motherhood was new to you too.

45
00:05:50.214 --> 00:05:52.784
I figured anyone would have it hard in your position.

46
00:05:55.055 --> 00:05:58.695
But was it frustrating enough to abandon...

47
00:05:59.324 --> 00:06:00.594
the both of us?

48
00:06:02.925 --> 00:06:04.065
All I wanted...

49
00:06:06.565 --> 00:06:08.235
was to breathe.

50
00:06:09.464 --> 00:06:11.034
Do Ah, gosh.

51
00:06:12.534 --> 00:06:14.805
Can you please stop crying?

52
00:06:19.474 --> 00:06:22.014
All right, okay. I'm sorry.

53
00:06:33.324 --> 00:06:34.795
Why are you still up?

54
00:06:35.665 --> 00:06:39.295
Jae Young, Do Ah cried all day.

55
00:06:39.594 --> 00:06:41.665
That's how all newborns are.

56
00:06:42.204 --> 00:06:43.365
I feel...

57
00:06:45.774 --> 00:06:48.045
like a breastfeeding robot.

58
00:06:53.115 --> 00:06:55.214
I'll sleep with Do Ah,

59
00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:56.945
so get a good night's sleep.

60
00:06:58.055 --> 00:07:00.685
I want to put on my white coat and see patients.

61
00:07:06.594 --> 00:07:08.464
I can even do well in an OR.

62
00:07:10.394 --> 00:07:12.394
I have the skills to save a person's life.

63
00:07:14.594 --> 00:07:16.334
You'll be able to after your maternity leave.

64
00:07:16.834 --> 00:07:18.204
Time will fly,

65
00:07:19.034 --> 00:07:20.435
and Do Ah will soon grow up.

66
00:07:24.675 --> 00:07:25.974
Do Ah, there we go.

(100 Days, Thank You for Coming to Us)

The receiver can't be reached. You will be directed to voicemail.

69
00:07:29.714 --> 00:07:30.844
She's not answering.

70
00:07:31.714 --> 00:07:33.315
She should be here by now.

71
00:07:33.454 --> 00:07:35.985
I know, but she's not picking up.

72
00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:38.824
Are you sure she went to get her hair done?

73
00:07:39.524 --> 00:07:40.524
Yes.

74
00:07:40.524 --> 00:07:43.264
Jae Young, be honest with us.

75
00:07:43.594 --> 00:07:45.594
Did something happen between you two?

76
00:07:48.605 --> 00:07:49.665
Goodness.

77
00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:07.485
All I've been hearing were Do Ah's cries,

78
00:08:10.425 --> 00:08:12.195
but other sounds came to me at that moment.

79
00:08:16.764 --> 00:08:18.995
The warm breeze and sun.

80
00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:22.834
I could also feel those too.

81
00:08:29.144 --> 00:08:30.745
That's when I was finally able to breathe.

82
00:08:34.545 --> 00:08:36.784
So I went back home and worked on my research paper.

83
00:08:37.545 --> 00:08:38.755
I felt alive again.

84
00:08:40.185 --> 00:08:42.824
Back then, I didn't know it was postpartum depression.

85
00:08:43.855 --> 00:08:46.094
When I finally made the connection, I denied it completely.

86
00:08:47.324 --> 00:08:49.295
Finding happiness in motherhood...

87
00:08:49.295 --> 00:08:51.834
and being a devoted mother...

88
00:08:53.865 --> 00:08:55.764
isn't who I am.

89
00:08:57.565 --> 00:09:01.974
I felt smothered whenever I saw you and Do Ah,

90
00:09:03.805 --> 00:09:06.675
and I never imagined that you'd give up your teaching position.

91
00:09:14.114 --> 00:09:16.354
I felt nothing but guilt toward Do Ah...

92
00:09:16.984 --> 00:09:18.824
which is why I was scared to even look at her.

93
00:09:20.925 --> 00:09:22.494
We've grown closer now though.

94
00:09:24.065 --> 00:09:25.195
I'm glad.

95
00:09:29.704 --> 00:09:31.604
Why don't we start over?

96
00:09:31.974 --> 00:09:33.305
I'll help raise Do Ah now.

97
00:09:36.405 --> 00:09:37.974
But I like where I am now.

98
00:09:38.775 --> 00:09:42.015
When I was with you, I thought it was my best option.

99
00:09:43.185 --> 00:09:44.584
But being a single dad isn't too bad.

100
00:09:45.785 --> 00:09:46.954
I'm doing all right.

101
00:09:51.084 --> 00:09:52.854
But I miss you.

102
00:09:54.594 --> 00:09:56.624
Can't you possibly move on from Ha Ri?

103
00:09:57.864 --> 00:09:59.265
Must I be the one...

104
00:10:00.964 --> 00:10:02.435
to move on instead?

105
00:10:13.844 --> 00:10:15.185
I'm heading out for my interview.

106
00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:18.714
With the mom who's a photographer? I loved that piece on her.

107
00:10:18.815 --> 00:10:20.254
The photos have a nice vibe too.

108
00:10:20.854 --> 00:10:23.484
Can you ask if we can feature some photos of her and her kid?

109
00:10:23.785 --> 00:10:25.324
- Sure. - Good luck out there.

110

113
00:10:44.474 --> 00:10:47.145
Do I make you uncomfortable?

114
00:10:48.915 --> 00:10:52.315
Wouldn't it be weirder if I said I wasn't?

115
00:11:03.165 --> 00:11:04.565
What can I do to help?

116
00:11:13.535 --> 00:11:16.045
Can you erase yourself from my life?

117
00:11:19.214 --> 00:11:21.915
I don't have the ability to do that.

118
00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.584
It may have started off as a miunderstanding,

119
00:11:28.015 --> 00:11:29.824
but my feelings for you weren't light.

120
00:11:32.594 --> 00:11:33.854
And...

121
00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:36.565
unlike you, I don't know how...

122
00:11:36.565 --> 00:11:38.734
to beautifully send off my one-sided love.

123
00:11:44.834 --> 00:11:46.374
Let me hate you.

124
00:11:50.275 --> 00:11:53.974
The arrow you randomly shot pierced right through my heart.

125
00:12:00.915 --> 00:12:03.055
Then hate me. Resent me too.

126
00:12:04.385 --> 00:12:05.525
You can also hit me if you want.

127
00:12:07.594 --> 00:12:09.425
For making me shed tears,

128
00:12:10.724 --> 00:12:12.635
you will have an unpleasant life.

129
00:12:14.135 --> 00:12:18.035
Until I'm able to move on, you should pretend to be miserable.

130
00:12:19.535 --> 00:12:22.945
That way, I'll hate you less and move on from you quicker.

131

132

I've given up on wanting a child, so you can stop getting therapy.

No, I got exhausted.

00:13:28.004 --> 00:13:30.545
Mr. Han, it's me. Let's head out.

136
00:13:39.385 --> 00:13:41.954
The mom is a photographer, and she wrote the baby journal...

137
00:13:41.954 --> 00:13:44.385
from the child's point of view. It's fun and the photos are nice.

138
00:13:44.954 --> 00:13:47.354
She's donating the royalties to a single parents charity.

139

Hello. I'm Jung In Ah.

Mr. Han.

145
00:14:38.515 --> 00:14:39.574
Mr. Han?

146
00:15:17.598 --> 00:15:21.838
Okay. How did you think of writing from the baby's point of view?

147
00:15:22.437 --> 00:15:24.697
I thought about...

148
00:15:24.738 --> 00:15:26.768
what my baby was thinking.

149
00:15:27.138 --> 00:15:30.207
Everything is brand new to the baby.

150
00:15:31.008 --> 00:15:32.748
I thought everything must be fascinating.

151
00:15:33.777 --> 00:15:35.317
The content is fun,

152
00:15:35.317 --> 00:15:37.777
and the pictures are warm, so it stayed with me.

153
00:15:38.248 --> 00:15:39.817
As I raised my child,

154
00:15:39.817 --> 00:15:42.317
I started looking at the world from a different angle.

155
00:15:42.917 --> 00:15:44.787
That may be why my photos changed as well.

To wrap up,

158
00:15:56.437 --> 00:15:59.037
let's take some pictures in front of your picture with Ra On.

159
00:15:59.368 --> 00:16:00.368
Mr. Han.

160
00:16:07.047 --> 00:16:08.577
Smile.

161
00:16:10.277 --> 00:16:11.577
Please look at the camera.

162
00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:14.947
Smile.

163
00:16:15.457 --> 00:16:17.488
Please give us a big smile.

164
00:16:18.927 --> 00:16:20.128
Smile.

165
00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:26.998
I can't smile.

166
00:16:28.228 --> 00:16:30.738
I'll take this picture myself and send it to you.

167
00:16:30.738 --> 00:16:32.868
I'm sure it'll have a similar tone.

168
00:16:37.878 --> 00:16:41.247
Sure. Okay then. Please email it to me.

169
00:16:52.358 --> 00:16:54.157
Thank you for making time for us.

170
00:16:54.358 --> 00:16:57.058
I have a meeting to get to, so I'll get going first.

171
00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:58.457
I'll be in touch.

172
00:17:03.798 --> 00:17:06.068
The hardest part about breaking up with you...

173
00:17:06.808 --> 00:17:08.878
was losing my best friend.

174
00:17:11.507 --> 00:17:13.308
It's nice talking to you again like this.

175
00:17:20.848 --> 00:17:22.217
Do you still hate me?

176
00:17:29.927 --> 00:17:31.257
Back then,

177
00:17:32.927 --> 00:17:34.328
I thought for sure...

178
00:17:35.767 --> 00:17:39.437
that you'd put me first before having a baby.

179
00:17:44.608 --> 00:17:45.707
I guess...

180
00:17:47.278 --> 00:17:48.878
that's why I resented you even more.

181
00:17:52.388 --> 00:17:54.187
I resented you too.

182
00:17:57.388 --> 00:17:59.687
It felt like a death sentence back then...

183
00:18:01.028 --> 00:18:04.558
when we did nothing wrong. We didn't know what to do.

184
00:18:06.227 --> 00:18:08.197
All we could see was our own pain.

185
00:18:11.167 --> 00:18:12.308
You're right.

186
00:18:14.507 --> 00:18:15.677
That's why...

187
00:18:18.378 --> 00:18:20.378
I made it really hard on you.

188
00:18:24.548 --> 00:18:26.118
I knew it was over,

189
00:18:27.417 --> 00:18:29.157
but I tried to hold on.

190
00:18:31.717 --> 00:18:35.598
That's why you had no choice but to leave.

191
00:18:38.257 --> 00:18:40.767
I was the one who couldn't handle it.

192
00:18:43.237 --> 00:18:45.138
Yes, it was partly because of the baby issue,

193
00:18:47.068 --> 00:18:49.207
but it's also because we weren't strong enough to endure it.

194
00:18:52.177 --> 00:18:53.808
If we had stayed together,

195
00:18:54.947 --> 00:18:56.618
we both would've become miserable.

196
00:19:04.517 --> 00:19:08.058
I thought holding on was how you protect your love.

197
00:19:17.767 --> 00:19:20.138
- Nice. How sweet. - Good.

198
00:19:20.568 --> 00:19:21.737
Look at your mommy.

199
00:19:22.078 --> 00:19:24.338
That's good. How sweet.

200
00:19:24.338 --> 00:19:26.148
- Dad, please look here too. - Okay.

201
00:19:26.477 --> 00:19:28.108
Look here.

202
00:19:29.148 --> 00:19:30.447
I should've...

203
00:19:32.618 --> 00:19:34.148
let you go for your sake.

204
00:19:38.017 --> 00:19:39.487
That's what I should've done.

205
00:19:46.497 --> 00:19:47.667
In Ah.

206
00:19:53.038 --> 00:19:54.138
Are you happy?

207
00:20:04.778 --> 00:20:05.848
Good.

208
00:20:07.648 --> 00:20:08.888
That's all that matters.

209
00:20:32.747 --> 00:20:35.648
Come back as I've come back.

210
00:20:37.177 --> 00:20:38.578
Let's all live together again.

211
00:20:55.028 --> 00:20:56.197
Do Ah.

212
00:20:56.967 --> 00:20:59.237
How was it like being with your mommy?

213
00:21:00.808 --> 00:21:03.707
Do you want to live with your mommy?

214
00:21:15.487 --> 00:21:17.717
What's going on here? Why does it taste good when I'm stressed?

215
00:21:17.717 --> 00:21:18.888
I know, right?

216
00:21:20.187 --> 00:21:23.997
Why are you eating so aggressively? What are you guys stressed about?

217
00:21:24.657 --> 00:21:27.528
My dad wants me to quit because we work late all the time.

218
00:21:27.997 --> 00:21:30.437
Is he conservative? Do you have a curfew and stuff?

219
00:21:30.568 --> 00:21:33.167
No. He's such a free spirit, he says to go somewhere...

220
00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:34.937
with a good work-life balance.

221
00:21:37.338 --> 00:21:39.477
What are you stressed about?

222
00:21:42.078 --> 00:21:45.517
That photographer mom whom I met this afternoon for our piece...

223
00:21:47.348 --> 00:21:50.157
I think she's Mr. Han's ex-girlfriend.

224
00:21:50.457 --> 00:21:51.788
- Oh my gosh. - Is she pretty?

225
00:21:51.788 --> 00:21:53.257
Yes, super pretty.

226
00:21:54.088 --> 00:21:56.358
Should I tell Ms. Jang?

227
00:21:57.028 --> 00:21:58.628
I shouldn't, right?

228
00:21:59.167 --> 00:22:01.028
Why would you, if she's super pretty?

229
00:22:01.398 --> 00:22:04.467
It's not like he cheated on her. No, don't tell her.

230
00:22:04.898 --> 00:22:05.967
Right?

231
00:22:08.808 --> 00:22:10.407
What about you? What's wrong?

232
00:22:12.138 --> 00:22:14.848
I told Ms. Jang that I'm quitting.

233
00:22:15.177 --> 00:22:16.447
- What? - Why?

234
00:22:19.388 --> 00:22:20.548
I...

235
00:22:21.048 --> 00:22:23.818
want to quit my job.

236
00:22:25.257 --> 00:22:26.987
Why do you want to quit?

237
00:22:28.558 --> 00:22:31.227
I have no reason to stay here anymore,

238
00:22:31.927 --> 00:22:34.427
and it's not like baby care magazines have a vision.

239
00:22:35.267 --> 00:22:37.138
The work isn't fun anymore.

240
00:22:39.507 --> 00:22:41.707
Do you have another job lined up?

241
00:22:42.477 --> 00:22:43.578
No, not yet.

242
00:22:44.778 --> 00:22:46.048
Gosh, okay.

243
00:22:46.947 --> 00:22:49.078
If you want to quit,

244
00:22:49.878 --> 00:22:51.848
I have no reason to stop you.

245
00:22:52.987 --> 00:22:55.548
Plus, the higher-ups have been telling me to reduce the staff,

246
00:22:55.657 --> 00:22:57.187
but I've been holding up until now.

247
00:22:59.957 --> 00:23:01.657
If there's a good opportunity, you should take it.

248
00:23:02.398 --> 00:23:04.798
If there's a place you want to go, I'll help you get a job there.

249
00:23:06.298 --> 00:23:07.997
But if that's not it,

250
00:23:09.538 --> 00:23:11.098
why don't you give me a chance?

251
00:23:13.068 --> 00:23:14.308
What chance?

252
00:23:15.937 --> 00:23:18.038
I want to do my best...

253
00:23:18.907 --> 00:23:23.118
to save the magazine with you all until you finally decide to leave.

254
00:23:24.118 --> 00:23:26.088
And I should do something for you guys.

255
00:23:28.888 --> 00:23:31.687
Yeon Ho probably expected to get a promotion...

256
00:23:31.687 --> 00:23:34.187
when I became the editor-in-chief.

257
00:23:34.757 --> 00:23:36.157
I'm sure she was disappointed,

258
00:23:37.197 --> 00:23:39.167
but she works hard without ever showing that.

259
00:23:40.368 --> 00:23:44.138
I should help her get a promotion just like how Ms. Shim did with me.

260
00:23:45.907 --> 00:23:47.138
As for So Yoon,

261
00:23:47.237 --> 00:23:49.578
I can't let her quit after only having done miscellaneous jobs.

262
00:23:50.477 --> 00:23:52.237
I should let her write an article so she can add it...

263
00:23:52.237 --> 00:23:53.608
to her portfolio for when she gets a job somewhere else.

264
00:23:54.707 --> 00:23:56.618
And as for you...

265
00:24:01.548 --> 00:24:03.417
You really don't listen to me.

266
00:24:05.058 --> 00:24:07.157
These days, I do.

267
00:24:07.157 --> 00:24:10.227
I told you to make a portfolio that's good enough...

268
00:24:10.227 --> 00:24:11.598
to make yourself proud.

269
00:24:11.598 --> 00:24:12.798
Well, did you?

270
00:24:17.937 --> 00:24:20.207
You're very creative, so you come up with great ideas,

271
00:24:20.207 --> 00:24:21.868
and you bring amazing photos.

272
00:24:22.737 --> 00:24:24.338
And now, you're pretty good at writing articles too.

273
00:24:25.778 --> 00:24:27.747
So I want to help you out a bit more.

274
00:24:28.848 --> 00:24:32.348
I feel like you could do better, but that's just how I feel.

275
00:24:33.747 --> 00:24:34.888
But most importantly,

276
00:24:36.088 --> 00:24:37.687
it seems like you're leaving unsatisfied,

277
00:24:37.687 --> 00:24:38.858
and that makes me feel bad.

278
00:24:41.828 --> 00:24:43.757
So I'd like you to reconsider.

279
00:24:44.657 --> 00:24:46.227
So what are you going to do?

280
00:24:46.368 --> 00:24:48.467
It looks like our magazine is going to disappear soon.

281
00:24:48.467 --> 00:24:49.967
Are you going to keep working here?

282
00:24:50.737 --> 00:24:54.068
Well, I should since she's going to help me get promoted.

283
00:24:54.638 --> 00:24:57.737
Hey, I have a huge affection for "The Baby" as well.

284
00:24:58.177 --> 00:25:00.808
Not only do I like my job, but I like the people here.

285
00:25:04.378 --> 00:25:08.017
I don't know what's going to happen, but I personally want to stay.

286
00:25:08.618 --> 00:25:11.088
But that's just me. You should leave while you can.

287
00:25:13.888 --> 00:25:16.828
I'm going to stay because I want to know...

288
00:25:16.828 --> 00:25:18.727
what's going to happen to our magazine.

289
00:25:20.497 --> 00:25:23.767
I really don't like Ms. Jang.

290
00:25:24.167 --> 00:25:27.338
She's always scolding me, and she won't even let me quit.

291
00:25:28.267 --> 00:25:30.177
But it looks like she has to fight against the company,

292
00:25:30.177 --> 00:25:31.638
so I guess I should stay and help.

293
00:25:34.447 --> 00:25:37.677
Yes, that's right. She can't fight alone.

294
00:25:37.677 --> 00:25:38.747
We should stay and help.

295
00:25:39.318 --> 00:25:40.888
Here. Let's do this.

296
00:25:40.888 --> 00:25:42.288
- Good luck to us all. - Loyalty!

297
00:25:42.288 --> 00:25:43.388
- Let's do this! - Let's do this!

298
00:25:55.568 --> 00:25:58.298
Let's not waste our precious time...

299
00:25:58.598 --> 00:26:01.007
and enjoy our lives and marriage.

300
00:26:16.858 --> 00:26:18.687
Should we have a small wedding?

301
00:26:19.088 --> 00:26:20.858
I'm not talking about an expensive one.

302
00:26:20.858 --> 00:26:22.388
I'm talking about an actual small wedding.

303
00:26:22.497 --> 00:26:25.058
What about our honeymoon? Is there a place you want to go?

304
00:26:26.927 --> 00:26:28.767
Ha Ri, you're still capable of having kids.

305
00:26:32.237 --> 00:26:33.937
You just have a lower chance than you did before.

306
00:26:35.068 --> 00:26:36.278
So why would you give up?

307
00:26:40.447 --> 00:26:42.407
You're giving up because you love me.

308
00:26:43.548 --> 00:26:45.148
But what's going to be next?

309
00:26:49.048 --> 00:26:50.157
I don't want...

310
00:26:51.217 --> 00:26:54.128
a child to cause trouble between us.

311
00:26:55.328 --> 00:26:58.328
See? We're already fighting.

312
00:27:05.237 --> 00:27:07.538
I told you we need to endure uncomfortable conversations.

313
00:27:07.907 --> 00:27:09.378
I told you we should never lose the fight.

314
00:27:11.437 --> 00:27:13.078
But it looks like you've lost.

315
00:27:14.747 --> 00:27:16.848
(Small weddings are all the rage.)

316
00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:25.088
Why are you being so mean?

317
00:27:25.088 --> 00:27:26.487
Let's be realistic.

318
00:27:27.828 --> 00:27:29.528
Do you think love will get us through everything?

319
00:27:29.858 --> 00:27:30.957
But what if...

320
00:27:31.828 --> 00:27:35.227
there comes a moment where love doesn't solve everything?

321
00:27:39.838 --> 00:27:41.838
- That won't happen. - Ha Ri.

322
00:27:42.907 --> 00:27:46.977
You can still have a normal family.

323
00:27:52.888 --> 00:27:54.318
Are you breaking up with me?

324
00:27:56.217 --> 00:27:57.717
I'm giving you time to think about it.

325
00:28:00.227 --> 00:28:03.528
You can live a life where you don't have to suffer...

326
00:28:04.257 --> 00:28:06.028
or give up anything.

327
00:28:09.497 --> 00:28:10.598
What...

328
00:28:12.868 --> 00:28:14.568
Do you suddenly not like me?

329
00:28:18.407 --> 00:28:22.007
If you're doing this for me, you're mistaken.

330
00:28:22.007 --> 00:28:23.878
Get to your senses and think rationally.

331
00:28:24.818 --> 00:28:26.947
Think about how selfish I was to cling onto you...

332
00:28:27.388 --> 00:28:29.358
just so I could be with you.

333
00:28:37.028 --> 00:28:39.497
I've been caught up with all the work at "The Baby",

334
00:28:39.927 --> 00:28:41.598
so I'll go away for shooting photos tomorrow.

335
00:28:43.138 --> 00:28:44.568
I don't know how long it'll take.

336
00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:48.638
But we should think about it...

337
00:28:50.207 --> 00:28:51.507
while we spend some time apart.

338
00:29:20.007 --> 00:29:21.207
You're coming back, right?

339
00:29:29.278 --> 00:29:30.417
It looks like...

340
00:29:31.548 --> 00:29:34.388
you're the one who needs time to think about things.

341
00:29:36.088 --> 00:29:37.257
So I'll let you take your time.

342
00:29:43.798 --> 00:29:46.828
It'll be hard to be away from each other even for a second.

343
00:29:48.997 --> 00:29:50.568
We'll miss each other so much that it will hurt.

344
00:29:58.278 --> 00:29:59.778
I hope you regret it and come back.

345
00:33:01.558 --> 00:33:03.028
It's the photo from Do Ah's first birthday party.

346
00:33:04.657 --> 00:33:06.568
The money you gave me...

347
00:33:07.227 --> 00:33:09.298
for the party and child support...

348
00:33:09.538 --> 00:33:11.167
was donated under Do Ah's name.

349
00:33:14.368 --> 00:33:16.878
Caring for Do Ah all day...

350
00:33:17.308 --> 00:33:18.677
has been driving me crazy too.

351
00:33:19.677 --> 00:33:21.747
I was too busy hating and resenting you...

352
00:33:22.477 --> 00:33:24.078
to find time to understand you.

353
00:33:25.818 --> 00:33:26.987
I'm sorry.

354
00:33:28.288 --> 00:33:30.517
I could've applied for paternity leave,

355
00:33:31.417 --> 00:33:34.358
but I considered caring for her to be your job.

356
00:33:37.328 --> 00:33:40.497
We both thought so highly of ourselves growing up...

357
00:33:41.167 --> 00:33:43.238
that our own self always came first.

358
00:33:43.838 --> 00:33:45.597
We had to get what we wanted.

359
00:33:47.537 --> 00:33:50.408
I still don't know what love is,

360
00:33:51.378 --> 00:33:54.077
but I don't think it's nothing like selfish thing...

361
00:33:55.678 --> 00:33:57.117
that we did to each other.

362
00:34:01.887 --> 00:34:03.318
Is it because of Ha Ri?

363
00:34:06.428 --> 00:34:07.827
After we ended things,

364
00:34:08.387 --> 00:34:10.358
I started to see her romantically.

365
00:34:11.457 --> 00:34:13.698
But just because it won't work with her...

366
00:34:14.468 --> 00:34:15.827
doesn't mean that I'll go back to you.

367
00:34:16.198 --> 00:34:17.468
My feelings were entirely different.

368
00:34:23.037 --> 00:34:24.338
I see you've made up your mind.

369
00:34:29.178 --> 00:34:31.778
But you do love Do Ah, don't you?

370
00:34:32.988 --> 00:34:34.017
Being a mother...

371
00:34:34.017 --> 00:34:37.218
doesn't mean that you must sacrifice everything.

372
00:34:38.488 --> 00:34:41.628
Setting a good example as a successful career woman...

373
00:34:43.028 --> 00:34:44.398
will make Do Ah proud too.

374
00:34:49.097 --> 00:34:50.968
I guess you're really shooting me down.

375
00:34:54.937 --> 00:34:56.238
Let's both live a life...

376
00:34:57.678 --> 00:34:59.707
where our priorities lie with our own self.

377
00:35:01.207 --> 00:35:02.747
Be the best doctor you can be,

378
00:35:03.517 --> 00:35:06.988
and I'll be the best dad I can be.

379
00:35:20.898 --> 00:35:22.227
The person you have reached is not available.

380
00:35:26.408 --> 00:35:27.767
The person you have reached is not available.

381
00:35:42.048 --> 00:35:43.488
Did I Sang leave?

382
00:35:44.457 --> 00:35:46.187
That must be.

383
00:35:46.827 --> 00:35:48.928
He called to say that he's quitting.

384
00:35:50.658 --> 00:35:51.898
He won't come back, right?

385
00:35:51.957 --> 00:35:53.097
I'm not sure,

386
00:35:53.628 --> 00:35:55.628
but he didn't say when he'd be back.

387
00:35:57.568 --> 00:35:58.637
Wait...

388
00:36:38.142 --> 00:36:39.212
Come out.

389
00:36:39.982 --> 00:36:41.442
I know you're in there.

390
00:36:42.843 --> 00:36:45.053
You can't leave like this.

391
00:36:46.352 --> 00:36:50.093
How could've it been the end? Get out here!

392
00:36:52.453 --> 00:36:54.462
I know you're in there.

393
00:39:07.863 --> 00:39:14.863
(3 months later)

394
00:39:27.212 --> 00:39:28.783
- We're late. - Gosh.

395
00:39:33.122 --> 00:39:34.553
I received a verbal confirmation...

396
00:39:34.553 --> 00:39:36.593
regarding the renewal of our toothpaste ad.

397
00:39:36.692 --> 00:39:38.892
However, the company only suggested six months.

398
00:39:39.392 --> 00:39:40.863
I'll try and score a longer deal.

399
00:39:40.863 --> 00:39:41.993
They're asking for a presentation on the company magazine, right?

400
00:39:41.993 --> 00:39:44.562
Yes, women's magazines will also give presentations as well.

401
00:39:44.562 --> 00:39:47.162
The experience we have will give us a competitive edge.

402
00:39:47.403 --> 00:39:49.363
- Here, let me. - Thanks.

403
00:39:56.002 --> 00:39:57.243
- Thank you. - There you go.

404
00:40:04.482 --> 00:40:06.212
How did it go with the advertisements?

405
00:40:07.283 --> 00:40:08.482
CCJJ signed a contract...

406
00:40:08.482 --> 00:40:10.593
of six months regarding its baby lotion.

407
00:40:10.892 --> 00:40:13.562
Other companies said they would strongly consider it.

408
00:40:13.792 --> 00:40:15.892
Which means that they won't.

409
00:40:16.263 --> 00:40:17.832
That's what I got too.

410
00:40:17.993 --> 00:40:20.303
I'm writing more ad proposals than actual articles.

411
00:40:20.433 --> 00:40:21.562
Why is that?

412
00:40:26.942 --> 00:40:29.042
So Ms. Jang...

413
00:40:30.073 --> 00:40:31.812
Did you look at our financial statement report?

414
00:40:32.013 --> 00:40:33.073
Yes, sir.

415
00:40:33.073 --> 00:40:37.013
Then you must've seen the advertisement profit went down.

416
00:40:37.153 --> 00:40:39.383
You asked for three months,

417
00:40:39.383 --> 00:40:41.383
so I've been fending off our bosses,

418
00:40:41.522 --> 00:40:43.192
but I'm in a tight spot too now.

419
00:40:44.093 --> 00:40:45.792
We've been talking to some companies,

420
00:40:45.792 --> 00:40:47.392
and I'm sure some of them will pan out.

421
00:40:48.323 --> 00:40:50.933
I know how hard you've all been working...

422
00:40:50.962 --> 00:40:52.763
which is why I want to take your side.

423
00:40:52.993 --> 00:40:55.933
However, the executives are more than irritated.

424
00:40:56.703 --> 00:40:59.803
You'll be hearing some news from up top soon.

425
00:41:00.602 --> 00:41:01.642
Sure.

426
00:41:10.013 --> 00:41:13.113
We wouldn't have to worry if we were able to score 10 ads annually.

427
00:41:13.482 --> 00:41:15.383
But that's a big number for us.

428
00:41:16.892 --> 00:41:19.153
Maybe it's because our special event on social media didn't work.

429
00:41:19.252 --> 00:41:22.763
Why don't we hold a nationwide contest for a baby model?

430
00:41:23.692 --> 00:41:26.062
Aren't we in this mess because we already spent too much money?

431
00:41:28.763 --> 00:41:32.173
Since I punched in, I should go and raise some money.

432
00:41:32.332 --> 00:41:34.073
- A lot would be nice. - Sure.

433
00:41:34.243 --> 00:41:36.042
Get those advertisement contracts for us.

434
00:41:36.243 --> 00:41:37.712
- Good luck. - See you.

435
00:41:41.212 --> 00:41:42.283
(Media Proposal)

436
00:41:42.283 --> 00:41:43.482
(Advertisement Proposal)

437
00:41:43.653 --> 00:41:46.113
Also, you know...

438
00:41:46.252 --> 00:41:48.582
how we always provide support.

439
00:41:48.852 --> 00:41:51.692
I'm sure it'll be of big help to the product promotion.

440
00:41:51.692 --> 00:41:54.062
- Yes, it'll help a lot. - That's right.

441
00:41:54.792 --> 00:41:57.232
- Hello. Sorry we're late. - Hello. Sorry.

442
00:41:57.832 --> 00:41:59.062
Have you been waiting long?

443
00:42:02.102 --> 00:42:03.433
Here.

444
00:42:03.433 --> 00:42:05.203
(A proposal for a baby walker song)

445
00:42:17.812 --> 00:42:19.412
- Get that. - Okay.

446
00:42:21.453 --> 00:42:24.323
Hey. Is your meeting not over yet?

447
00:42:25.493 --> 00:42:28.723
I was at QK and just got back.

448
00:42:29.062 --> 00:42:30.993
I'm going to the bookstore this afternoon.

449
00:42:31.792 --> 00:42:35.832
- When will you be back? - I have no one to eat with.

450
00:42:36.433 --> 00:42:38.803
- Darn it. - Okay. Work hard.

451
00:42:39.942 --> 00:42:42.473
- Darn. I don't want to eat alone. - Darn. I don't want to eat alone.

452
00:42:45.613 --> 00:42:47.743
- Where are you eating? - Over there.

453
00:42:48.482 --> 00:42:49.613
Let's go.

454
00:42:57.252 --> 00:43:01.323
You should take a look at our Precious.

455
00:43:02.522 --> 00:43:03.863
No thanks. I'm not into stars.

456
00:43:04.133 --> 00:43:05.363
Exactly. They're stars.

457
00:43:05.662 --> 00:43:07.662
They twinkle in my heart.

458
00:43:11.803 --> 00:43:13.033
I don't know.

459
00:43:14.042 --> 00:43:17.142
- About what? - If older guys in our age...

460
00:43:17.173 --> 00:43:19.442
look at young, pretty girls like that,

461
00:43:19.442 --> 00:43:21.743
they say we're dirty old men leering at them.

462
00:43:22.343 --> 00:43:23.852
Yes, it's just a prejudice,

463
00:43:24.082 --> 00:43:26.113
but I don't watch on purpose to avoid hearing things like that.

464
00:43:33.723 --> 00:43:35.593
Of course you're pure-hearted,

465
00:43:35.593 --> 00:43:38.162
but what others think may be different.

466
00:43:39.133 --> 00:43:42.863
At our age, I feel like we should be more dignified.

467
00:43:43.133 --> 00:43:44.732
I'm just saying that out of concern.

468
00:43:47.803 --> 00:43:49.002
I just...

469
00:43:50.712 --> 00:43:53.982
like seeing young people passionately pursue their dreams.

470
00:43:54.982 --> 00:43:57.683
Since I can't do that anymore,

471
00:43:58.482 --> 00:43:59.653
it's comforting.

472
00:44:01.053 --> 00:44:04.553
That's why... That's why I watch them,

473
00:44:06.622 --> 00:44:08.323
but I guess it could look bad.

474
00:44:22.303 --> 00:44:23.372
That's so cold.

475
00:44:26.883 --> 00:44:27.982
Here you go.

476
00:44:30.252 --> 00:44:31.352
Ha Ri.

477
00:44:32.883 --> 00:44:34.223
Don't think about anything else.

478
00:44:35.122 --> 00:44:36.383
"Ha Ri"?

479
00:44:37.622 --> 00:44:38.892
That woke you up, didn't it?

480
00:44:39.653 --> 00:44:42.962
Did you just risk your life to wake me up?

481
00:44:43.892 --> 00:44:45.033
Aren't I brave?

482
00:44:45.162 --> 00:44:47.363
Then let me be a little braver.

483
00:44:47.602 --> 00:44:49.363
You must have nine lives.

484
00:44:52.372 --> 00:44:55.573
Ha Ri. No. Hey you, Ha Ri.

485
00:44:58.113 --> 00:45:00.513
(Cider)

486
00:45:06.582 --> 00:45:08.522
Hey, you. Get back here.

487
00:45:08.522 --> 00:45:09.622
Ha Ri.

488
00:45:11.423 --> 00:45:13.093
You must be worried about me.

489
00:45:14.323 --> 00:45:16.593
You don't have to try so hard to make me feel better.

490
00:45:17.462 --> 00:45:19.062
You know I liked you, right?

491
00:45:20.703 --> 00:45:23.973
Back then, you seemed cool, so I wanted to emulate you.

492
00:45:24.903 --> 00:45:28.203
Everything you said and did...

493
00:45:29.542 --> 00:45:32.142
seemed very special to me.

494
00:45:33.613 --> 00:45:34.712
So...

495
00:45:35.442 --> 00:45:37.082
if you feel like you did something wrong,

496
00:45:37.912 --> 00:45:40.122
and felt like you're a loser,

497
00:45:40.883 --> 00:45:43.122
just remember that there was someone who liked...

498
00:45:43.493 --> 00:45:45.252
even your imperfections.

499
00:45:46.692 --> 00:45:47.892
Please remember that.

500
00:45:49.692 --> 00:45:50.763
Thank you.

501
00:45:51.633 --> 00:45:55.133
You too. When people disrespect you and put you down...

502
00:45:55.133 --> 00:45:56.763
for being clueless,

503
00:45:57.772 --> 00:46:00.272
remember that there was someone...

504
00:46:00.743 --> 00:46:03.772
who was comforted greatly by your words.

505
00:46:07.513 --> 00:46:08.613
Thank you.

506
00:46:10.212 --> 00:46:11.312
Before we go.

507
00:46:14.953 --> 00:46:16.283
- Get home safely. - Bye.

508
00:46:16.283 --> 00:46:17.392
Good night.

509
00:47:15.883 --> 00:47:19.453
Because I've never been isolated due to a landslide.

510
00:47:23.252 --> 00:47:25.622
Because I've never proposed before...

511
00:47:26.022 --> 00:47:27.392
with my heart racing this much.

512
00:47:28.892 --> 00:47:30.332
Where is he hiding?

513
00:47:38.973 --> 00:47:42.442
We'll try to go with a clean image and make it as neat as possible.

514
00:47:42.872 --> 00:47:45.372
- Should we make the light brighter? - Yes.

515
00:47:45.372 --> 00:47:46.872
So...

516
00:47:47.142 --> 00:47:49.542
They said the concept is wet tissues used in a palace,

517
00:47:49.542 --> 00:47:51.982
and asked to make it look as fancy as possible.

518
00:47:52.053 --> 00:47:53.113
Palace?

519
00:47:53.553 --> 00:47:55.122
We don't live in a monarchy.

520
00:47:55.582 --> 00:47:56.653
Fine.

521
00:47:56.923 --> 00:48:00.462
Then let's make it a bit darker.

522
00:48:00.522 --> 00:48:01.593
Okay.

523
00:48:06.832 --> 00:48:08.933
You should just get mad instead.

524
00:48:10.062 --> 00:48:11.803
I'm not having much fun.

525
00:48:12.872 --> 00:48:15.173
I wasn't miserable, so I couldn't pretend to be.

526
00:48:18.673 --> 00:48:20.613
Why would I get mad at you?

527
00:48:23.542 --> 00:48:25.482
I don't hate you anymore.

528
00:48:26.482 --> 00:48:27.622
You should get back to work.

529
00:48:36.792 --> 00:48:38.792
I was worried that she hated me,

530
00:48:40.602 --> 00:48:42.232
so why am I disappointed that she doesn't?

531
00:48:43.403 --> 00:48:45.002
Eu Ddeum, just a minute.

532
00:48:47.502 --> 00:48:49.973
Does Mr. Kim...

533
00:48:50.073 --> 00:48:52.613
try to make you like girl groups too?

534
00:48:56.312 --> 00:48:59.283
He doesn't if I get him photo cards or fangear.

535
00:48:59.982 --> 00:49:01.122
My gosh.

536
00:49:02.223 --> 00:49:03.823
That's so sad.

537
00:49:04.093 --> 00:49:05.752
I was sad too, when I first heard...

538
00:49:06.022 --> 00:49:07.223
about his daughter.

539
00:49:08.093 --> 00:49:09.692
- His daughter? - Yes.

540
00:49:10.593 --> 00:49:13.903
His daughter was so shy, that she had no friends,

541
00:49:14.033 --> 00:49:16.502
and didn't want to go to school. So he scolded her.

542
00:49:16.703 --> 00:49:19.272
And she didn't talk to him for three years.

543
00:49:19.832 --> 00:49:21.002
Three years?

544
00:49:21.772 --> 00:49:24.243
She locked herself in her room and only watched Precious,

545
00:49:24.573 --> 00:49:28.042
so he watched them religiously so that he could talk to her.

546
00:49:28.482 --> 00:49:31.582
Then he went to concerts with her,

547
00:49:31.582 --> 00:49:33.283
and joined the fan club together.

548
00:49:33.783 --> 00:49:35.022
Now they're like friends.

549
00:49:35.352 --> 00:49:38.323
Although I feel like he's more into them now.

550
00:49:39.392 --> 00:49:40.462
What...

551
00:49:41.363 --> 00:49:43.832
Why does he have such a sad story?

552
00:49:44.033 --> 00:49:45.192
I feel so bad.

553
00:49:55.343 --> 00:49:58.642
Jung Karen, Kim Mi Kyung,

554
00:49:58.912 --> 00:50:02.183
Lee Soo Hyun, Kang Yoo Ri,

555
00:50:02.513 --> 00:50:05.383
Jun Ji Soo, Yoo Ra Jung,

556
00:50:05.582 --> 00:50:08.683
Jung Karen, Kim Mi Kyung,

557
00:50:08.982 --> 00:50:10.323
Lee Soo Hyun...

558
00:50:10.792 --> 00:50:12.223
Kang Yoo Ri,

559
00:50:12.622 --> 00:50:15.863
Jun Ji Soo, Yoo Ra Jung,

560
00:50:16.192 --> 00:50:20.263
Precious. We'll protect you.

561
00:50:33.412 --> 00:50:34.513
Ta-da.

562
00:50:35.343 --> 00:50:37.883
- What's this? - Precious concert tickets.

563
00:50:38.712 --> 00:50:41.783
Mr. Nam got them for me. He said they were hard to get.

564
00:50:42.183 --> 00:50:45.192
My gosh. You need to have saved the world in your past life...

565
00:50:45.192 --> 00:50:46.653
to get tickets like these.

566
00:50:46.892 --> 00:50:49.122
I must have saved someone big in my past life.

567
00:50:50.162 --> 00:50:52.562
Don't you feel like the contract negotiations will go well too?

568
00:50:54.162 --> 00:50:56.332
Maybe they'll give us a year instead of six months.

569
00:50:56.433 --> 00:50:58.403
Right. That's how I feel too.

570
00:51:00.332 --> 00:51:01.542
I have a great feeling.

571
00:51:03.102 --> 00:51:04.412
Let's go.

572
00:51:05.212 --> 00:51:06.272
Let's go.

573
00:51:09.783 --> 00:51:11.613
Precious concert tickets.

574
00:51:12.082 --> 00:51:13.683
I heard you were in the fan club.

575
00:51:14.223 --> 00:51:15.453
Can't you get them?

576
00:51:15.622 --> 00:51:19.252
I'm not asking for anything in exchange for the ad contract.

577
00:51:19.392 --> 00:51:20.622
I'm just asking.

578
00:51:20.962 --> 00:51:23.122
My kid won't eat or study,

579
00:51:23.122 --> 00:51:26.062
saying she wants to go to the concert.

580
00:51:29.602 --> 00:51:31.703
Then... Do you think...

581
00:51:32.403 --> 00:51:34.272
you can extend the contract...

582
00:51:35.002 --> 00:51:38.412
from six months to a year?

583
00:51:39.973 --> 00:51:43.042
Mr. Kim, I'm not asking you for a bribe.

584
00:51:43.513 --> 00:51:46.412
I'm only asking because we're close.

585
00:51:46.752 --> 00:51:49.582
And if you really do get me those tickets,

586
00:51:50.022 --> 00:51:54.022
why wouldn't I extend the contract to a year?

587
00:51:56.062 --> 00:51:57.392
Oh, I see.

588
00:52:19.053 --> 00:52:24.223
I just happened to have their concert tickets.

589
00:52:25.223 --> 00:52:26.423
My goodness.

590
00:52:28.692 --> 00:52:31.192
My gosh, you brought these for me?

591
00:52:34.533 --> 00:52:37.473
Revise the contract period to one year,

592
00:52:37.502 --> 00:52:39.272
- and send it to them. - Okay, sir.

593
00:52:40.232 --> 00:52:42.343
Thank you.

594
00:52:42.542 --> 00:52:43.973
Okay, bye then.

595
00:52:47.142 --> 00:52:48.243
Please give them back.

596
00:52:51.312 --> 00:52:53.613
Give him back the tickets.

597
00:52:56.553 --> 00:52:59.022
Why are you telling me to return what I got from him?

598
00:52:59.892 --> 00:53:01.892
You obviously asked him to bribe you.

599
00:53:02.093 --> 00:53:03.593
And even if he gave them to you as a gift,

600
00:53:03.593 --> 00:53:05.133
you shouldn't have accepted them.

601
00:53:05.363 --> 00:53:07.133
And most importantly, you can't expect him...

602
00:53:07.133 --> 00:53:08.462
to give you those tickets just because you're close.

603
00:53:12.073 --> 00:53:14.042
Eu Ddeum, what are you doing?

604
00:53:15.542 --> 00:53:18.113
You should think before you talk, young man.

605
00:53:18.243 --> 00:53:19.673
You need to learn how to be more flexible.

606
00:53:20.073 --> 00:53:22.243
You're not good enough to do sales.

607
00:53:23.542 --> 00:53:26.912
I was told not to let advertisers treat me unfairly when I do sales.

608
00:53:27.723 --> 00:53:28.923
I've always thought of you as someone...

609
00:53:28.923 --> 00:53:31.792
who's fair and rational.

610
00:53:32.423 --> 00:53:34.423
I'd like to remember you like that.

611
00:53:34.522 --> 00:53:35.562
And...

612
00:53:35.993 --> 00:53:38.662
I hope we do business based on a fair relationship.

613
00:53:39.792 --> 00:53:40.903
Please do me a favor, sir.

614
00:53:47.073 --> 00:53:48.442
I'm sorry.

615
00:53:49.142 --> 00:53:51.642
I guess I taught him too well.

616
00:53:53.642 --> 00:53:55.912
Well, then...

617
00:53:56.783 --> 00:54:00.113
I'll tell the company that you agreed...

618
00:54:00.352 --> 00:54:03.522
to extend the contract period to a year.

619
00:54:04.553 --> 00:54:07.292
Verbal agreements are also considered legally valid.

620
00:54:07.892 --> 00:54:09.263
Thank you so much.

621
00:54:14.803 --> 00:54:16.062
Hey, Sang Gon.

622
00:54:17.533 --> 00:54:19.033
It hasn't been eight months yet.

623
00:54:19.973 --> 00:54:21.703
Are your wife and the baby okay?

624
00:54:23.203 --> 00:54:26.142
Okay, let me know once she's in labor.

625
00:54:26.513 --> 00:54:27.642
Okay, bye.

626
00:54:33.812 --> 00:54:35.183
This schedule isn't...

627
00:54:35.183 --> 00:54:37.082
This is a lot.

628
00:54:37.082 --> 00:54:38.653
It's not too bad.

629
00:54:38.653 --> 00:54:40.392
The more you work, the more you get...

630
00:54:40.392 --> 00:54:43.263
Do you think I'll get paid more? My pay has been the same for years.

631
00:54:44.162 --> 00:54:46.593
- I'm sorry... - If you're really sorry,

632
00:54:47.162 --> 00:54:49.863
then give me a little raise.

633
00:54:51.703 --> 00:54:54.243
Gosh, I'm starting to miss I Sang.

634
00:54:54.602 --> 00:54:55.602
I...

635
00:54:58.673 --> 00:55:00.683
I suddenly miss him so much.

636
00:55:00.982 --> 00:55:04.312
Didn't he come back? I heard someone saw him.

637
00:55:07.082 --> 00:55:08.783
That's nonsense.

638
00:55:08.923 --> 00:55:11.392
He has a very common-looking face.

639
00:55:11.522 --> 00:55:14.392
So people easily get mistaken.

640
00:55:14.493 --> 00:55:16.522
How is that face common?

641
00:55:16.522 --> 00:55:18.332
Anyone would easily recognize him.

642
00:55:20.033 --> 00:55:22.062
You're done, right? You should go home.

643
00:55:22.363 --> 00:55:23.462
Get out of here.

644
00:55:25.473 --> 00:55:27.772
My goodness, look at the time.

645
00:55:28.673 --> 00:55:30.142
- See you. - Bye.

646
00:55:33.142 --> 00:55:35.482
Mr. Nam, about the subfertile couple...

647
00:55:35.542 --> 00:55:37.482
The wife got hospitalized because she might give birth prematurely.

648
00:55:37.482 --> 00:55:40.383
Once they call, we need to go and film her giving birth.

649
00:55:40.482 --> 00:55:43.183
But isn't that I Sang's...

650
00:55:46.453 --> 00:55:48.392
I guess I could do it.

651
00:55:48.392 --> 00:55:50.423
You need to answer your phone even if I call after midnight.

652
00:55:50.423 --> 00:55:51.562
Okay.

653
00:55:55.633 --> 00:55:56.832
Don't forget, okay?

654
00:56:02.102 --> 00:56:04.872
If you even did the final interview, doesn't that mean you got the job?

655
00:56:05.212 --> 00:56:07.073
They had already decided to hire me...

656
00:56:07.212 --> 00:56:08.942
because they even explained what I'd be doing.

657
00:56:09.042 --> 00:56:10.883
Then what was the problem?

658
00:56:11.982 --> 00:56:13.453
I put my kids first.

659
00:56:14.223 --> 00:56:17.223
They told me I won't be able to go home once we start doing projects.

660
00:56:17.993 --> 00:56:19.993
So I instantly told them that I can't work there.

661
00:56:20.993 --> 00:56:22.892
My husband works until late.

662
00:56:23.763 --> 00:56:25.292
I can't leave the kids home all by themselves.

663
00:56:25.993 --> 00:56:28.203
Why don't you find a babysitter?

664
00:56:28.633 --> 00:56:31.602
Let's say I give the babysitter every single penny I earn.

665
00:56:32.673 --> 00:56:34.473
In case I have to work on weekends,

666
00:56:34.673 --> 00:56:36.442
I can't leave them with a babysitter all year.

667
00:56:37.642 --> 00:56:40.013
Why can't companies have a daycare center?

668
00:56:44.912 --> 00:56:46.883
We can't be the only ones who are struggling, right?

669
00:56:47.823 --> 00:56:49.022
I don't know.

670
00:56:52.192 --> 00:56:53.653
Hasn't I Sang called yet?

671
00:56:57.692 --> 00:56:59.562
I feel like he's back.

672
00:57:00.462 --> 00:57:01.662
But he hasn't called.

673
00:57:03.363 --> 00:57:05.303
I'm guessing this might really be the end.

674
00:57:09.142 --> 00:57:11.073
Do you think we're trying too hard...

675
00:57:11.973 --> 00:57:13.912
to have what we can't have?

676
00:57:17.912 --> 00:57:20.053
It's so hard to get a job!

677
00:57:23.352 --> 00:57:26.022
It's so hard to love someone.

678
00:57:26.852 --> 00:57:28.923
It's so hard to raise children!

679
00:57:30.022 --> 00:57:32.363
It's so hard to get pregnant.

680
00:57:36.332 --> 00:57:37.803
Why are you crying?

681
00:57:39.602 --> 00:57:40.772
What about you?

682
00:57:41.542 --> 00:57:42.772
Stop crying.

683
00:57:42.772 --> 00:57:45.573
You made things awkward by crying all of a sudden.

684
00:57:45.642 --> 00:57:47.312
You started talking about something sad.

685
00:57:47.312 --> 00:57:49.412
Why are you sad about it when I'm totally fine?

686
00:57:49.412 --> 00:57:50.912
I feel sad just by looking at you.

687
00:57:50.912 --> 00:57:52.183
Have you lost your mind?

688
00:57:54.252 --> 00:57:55.553
You look ugly. Stop crying.

689
00:57:55.553 --> 00:57:57.153
You look ugly too.

690
00:57:58.392 --> 00:58:01.392
Gosh, why is the weather so darn nice?

691
00:58:02.993 --> 00:58:04.263
My goodness.

692
00:58:12.102 --> 00:58:17.502
(Gugudan Tripe)

693
00:58:35.562 --> 00:58:36.593
Hey.

694
00:58:38.093 --> 00:58:39.093
Hey.

695
00:58:41.863 --> 00:58:43.803
Is Jeong Won taking care of Do Ah?

696
00:58:44.633 --> 00:58:47.203
I take care of her for 4 days, and she takes care of her for 3 days.

697
00:58:47.743 --> 00:58:49.442
Jeong Won moved to a place near my house.

698
00:58:50.303 --> 00:58:51.513
- That's great. - Yes.

699
00:58:54.613 --> 00:58:57.042
- Here. - No, it's okay.

700
00:58:57.953 --> 00:59:01.022
Why? Has your drunken frenzy gotten worse?

701
00:59:01.153 --> 00:59:04.053
Does it become hard to tell if you're an animal or not...

702
00:59:04.252 --> 00:59:05.252
once you get drunk these days?

703
00:59:05.252 --> 00:59:07.692
Gosh, stop talking nonsense.

704
00:59:08.522 --> 00:59:10.323
I'm still taking medicine.

705
00:59:10.763 --> 00:59:12.093
Oh, really?

706
00:59:12.993 --> 00:59:15.832
It looks like you're being careful so you won't end up calling I Sang.

707
00:59:17.102 --> 00:59:18.703
This is why I hate you.

708
00:59:18.703 --> 00:59:21.272
It'd be great if you weren't always so obvious.

709
00:59:21.272 --> 00:59:23.073
Just worry about yourself.

710
00:59:24.673 --> 00:59:28.113
How are you doing? Are you dating anyone these days?

711
00:59:30.843 --> 00:59:33.312
Who would want to date a divorced guy with a kid?

712
00:59:34.283 --> 00:59:37.153
The world isn't that generous.

713
00:59:38.093 --> 00:59:41.723
There are tons of reasons why one shouldn't love anyone.

714
00:59:42.692 --> 00:59:45.232
No one's perfect in this world.

715
00:59:45.692 --> 00:59:48.303
No one's disqualified to love.

716
00:59:49.533 --> 00:59:52.903
You either haven't found anyone yet, or you let someone go.

717
00:59:54.843 --> 00:59:58.542
But you can't live your life without ever loving someone.

718
01:00:00.173 --> 01:00:02.642
Do you really think love forgives all?

719
01:00:04.283 --> 01:00:07.013
Must you sacrifice yourself for the other person...

720
01:00:07.252 --> 01:00:08.653
in order to call it true love?

721
01:00:10.453 --> 01:00:12.953
You were always like that.

722
01:00:13.522 --> 01:00:15.763
Every time you fell in love, you lost yourself.

723
01:00:16.062 --> 01:00:17.993
You always put the other person first.

724
01:00:18.832 --> 01:00:21.562
So look back on how you loved people.

725
01:00:22.263 --> 01:00:24.303
You're not disqualified.

726
01:00:24.473 --> 01:00:26.703
So it's time you love someone properly.

727
01:00:29.102 --> 01:00:32.872
That might be why I Sang left you.

728
01:00:36.243 --> 01:00:37.542
Do you think so?

729
01:00:41.183 --> 01:00:43.383
I think he had already planned not to come back when he left.

730
01:00:47.292 --> 01:00:48.363
Hey.

731
01:00:48.723 --> 01:00:50.662
You're such a waste.

732
01:00:52.562 --> 01:00:55.062
You're a really great person.

733
01:00:55.562 --> 01:00:59.133
You're lovable, and you deserve to be loved.

734
01:01:00.133 --> 01:01:02.573
But if you live all by yourself without anyone knowing it,

735
01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:03.973
it'd be such a waste.

736
01:01:06.473 --> 01:01:09.843
Meet someone who sees you for who you really are.

737
01:01:11.412 --> 01:01:13.153
And if I Sang was that kind of person,

738
01:01:14.522 --> 01:01:16.022
I'm sure you'll meet him again soon.

739
01:01:20.752 --> 01:01:22.662
Ha Ri, good luck.

740
01:01:33.033 --> 01:01:34.272
Hey.

741
01:01:35.042 --> 01:01:36.642
You're going to come back again for tripe, right?

742
01:01:37.942 --> 01:01:40.312
How can I come to this place when you're a regular here?

743
01:01:40.642 --> 01:01:42.312
If we happen to cross paths,

744
01:01:42.312 --> 01:01:44.343
I'll have to pretend to be friends with all my might.

745
01:01:45.153 --> 01:01:46.283
I can't be bothered.

746
01:01:48.522 --> 01:01:49.653
Ha Ri,

747
01:01:50.953 --> 01:01:52.153
I wish you luck.

748
01:01:57.522 --> 01:01:59.692
- I'll get going. - Take care.

749
01:02:01.502 --> 01:02:05.173
(Gugudan Tripe)

750
01:02:24.053 --> 01:02:26.493
How is one supposed to love?

751
01:02:41.673 --> 01:02:42.803
Yes, Sang Gon.

752
01:02:43.542 --> 01:02:44.673
Right now?

753
01:02:45.372 --> 01:02:46.473
I'm on my way.

754
01:02:51.212 --> 01:02:53.252
Mr. Nam, the baby is on its way.

755
01:02:53.412 --> 01:02:54.883
Can you meet me at the hospital?

756
01:02:54.982 --> 01:02:56.653
I'll text you the address.

757
01:03:03.392 --> 01:03:04.593
I'll call you back.

758
01:03:05.433 --> 01:03:06.562
Where's Ji Hye?

759
01:03:06.633 --> 01:03:07.903
She's getting ready for childbirth.

760
01:03:07.903 --> 01:03:08.933
I was asked to step outside for a second.

761
01:03:09.232 --> 01:03:11.272
The doctor said her membranes ruptured prematurely,

762
01:03:11.272 --> 01:03:12.903
but it's been sorted out.

763
01:03:13.203 --> 01:03:14.573
I'm glad.

764
01:03:14.573 --> 01:03:16.042
No filming will be allowed in the delivery room...

765
01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:17.912
since there could be an emergency.

766
01:03:18.073 --> 01:03:19.243
You should get it done right now.

767
01:03:20.743 --> 01:03:21.843
Got it.

768
01:03:23.542 --> 01:03:25.712
She'll soon give birth. You may head inside.

769
01:03:25.712 --> 01:03:27.592
- Sure. I'll get going. - Of course.

(Main Building 2nd Floor)

772
01:03:32.323 --> 01:03:33.823
- Please pick up. - The person you have reached...

773
01:03:35.423 --> 01:03:36.863
Why isn't he picking up?

774
01:04:07.553 --> 01:04:09.522

(Oh My Baby)

777
01:05:07.212 --> 01:05:08.352
I missed you.

778
01:05:08.582 --> 01:05:11.653
Though it may bring misery, I want to be with you.

779
01:05:12.022 --> 01:05:15.093
With a child or without one,

780
01:05:15.462 --> 01:05:17.363
I wish to be happy.

781
01:05:17.593 --> 01:05:18.792
As if there's much to happiness.

782
01:05:18.993 --> 01:05:20.633
A morning like this is the definition of it.

783
01:05:20.792 --> 01:05:23.433
You agreed not to be kind to just about anyone.

784
01:05:23.433 --> 01:05:26.203
I'm only kind to the people I like.

785
01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:30.372
An enormous gold pig ran toward me like a rhinoceros.

786
01:05:30.372 --> 01:05:31.743
It's a conception dream!

787
01:05:32.473 --> 01:05:34.743
It's a conception dream, right?

788
01:05:35.683 --> 01:05:36.783
You may come in.
