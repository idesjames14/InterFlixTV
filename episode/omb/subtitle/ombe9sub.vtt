00:00:41.557 --> 00:00:42.688
Why do you keep...

2
00:00:44.688 --> 00:00:46.458
showing up like this?

3
00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.197
It truly is a coincidence.

4
00:00:52.898 --> 00:00:54.067
Good night, then.

5
00:01:06.507 --> 00:01:07.677
How can you...

6
00:01:10.577 --> 00:01:12.848
be this beautiful?

7
00:01:16.058 --> 00:01:17.518
And what if I'm beautiful?

8
00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:24.628
What comes next?

9
00:01:31.507 --> 00:01:32.668
This.

10
00:02:53.717 --> 00:02:55.217
When is this going to stop?

11
00:02:57.057 --> 00:02:58.958
This is so awkward. It's awkward.

12
00:02:59.728 --> 00:03:00.828
Look over there.

13
00:03:00.888 --> 00:03:02.758
It's like a scene from a movie!

14
00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:05.597
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

15
00:03:10.437 --> 00:03:11.538
What do I say?

16
00:03:11.937 --> 00:03:14.008
No, wait. Please don't say a word.

17
00:03:16.937 --> 00:03:18.508
It did seem like a scene from a movie, right?

18
00:03:20.347 --> 00:03:23.717
Right, a scene from a movie...

19
00:03:25.717 --> 00:03:26.888
Goodness.

20
00:03:27.448 --> 00:03:29.988
I had no idea the riverside was packed.

21
00:03:32.627 --> 00:03:36.228
Then why don't we get going?

22
00:03:37.057 --> 00:03:38.768
What do we do?

23
00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:40.597
Shall we?

24
00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:45.467
- Congratulations! - You're so pretty!

25
00:04:14.568 --> 00:04:15.967
I had a good time today.

26
00:04:17.198 --> 00:04:20.467
I'm not saying that I enjoyed "it", but...

27
00:04:25.877 --> 00:04:26.948
Well,

28
00:04:27.978 --> 00:04:31.147
I'm glad I caught you since I was hoping to.

29
00:04:32.717 --> 00:04:33.818
I mean...

30
00:04:35.587 --> 00:04:38.788
I can't believe you crumbled the wall that I had up.

31
00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:46.527
I'm only saying this so that you won't overthink it.

32
00:04:49.768 --> 00:04:50.998
It wasn't a mistake.

33
00:04:53.138 --> 00:04:54.237
I...

34
00:04:56.378 --> 00:04:57.948
like you, Ms. Jang.

35
00:05:05.118 --> 00:05:06.287
I'm sorry...

36
00:05:07.518 --> 00:05:08.587
for not telling you sooner.

37
00:05:14.597 --> 00:05:16.998
From this moment on, let's not worry...

38
00:05:17.597 --> 00:05:19.368
about what's to come...

39
00:05:20.568 --> 00:05:21.797
and be curious about it instead.

40
00:05:24.138 --> 00:05:25.237
Sure.

41
00:05:27.638 --> 00:05:28.708
Good night.

42
00:05:33.178 --> 00:05:34.277
Good night.

43
00:06:08.318 --> 00:06:09.717
Goodness. Bottoms up.

44
00:06:16.188 --> 00:06:19.388
So what are your thoughts, Mr. Kim?

45
00:06:19.888 --> 00:06:23.498
They're delicious. They really are.

46
00:06:23.698 --> 00:06:24.768
The place serves incredible food.

47
00:06:29.768 --> 00:06:30.868
Mr. Kim,

48
00:06:32.407 --> 00:06:36.678
would it be all right to promote Ms. Jang as our new editor-in-chief?

49
00:06:37.378 --> 00:06:38.878
She may not have the best reputation,

50
00:06:39.448 --> 00:06:41.277
but her work speaks for itself.

51
00:06:49.818 --> 00:06:52.628
But I guess her reputation matters...

52
00:06:53.357 --> 00:06:55.498
since it can cause us a lot of issues.

53
00:06:59.768 --> 00:07:03.097
The decision should be yours, sir.

54
00:07:07.107 --> 00:07:08.208
Let's drink then.

55
00:07:12.378 --> 00:07:16.578
For now, I've been looking for an outside hire.

56
00:07:16.948 --> 00:07:19.748
Someone who has experience in advertisement.

57
00:07:20.547 --> 00:07:23.188
Still, it shouldn't be a unilateral decision...

58
00:07:23.188 --> 00:07:24.958
on my end.

59
00:07:25.058 --> 00:07:27.958
I'd like the opinions of the employees too,

60
00:07:28.097 --> 00:07:30.397
so don't hesitate to tell me how you think.

61
00:07:31.597 --> 00:07:34.597
But if advertisement deals start to drop,

62
00:07:34.597 --> 00:07:38.268
someone within the department will be held accountable for.

63
00:07:40.237 --> 00:07:41.737
Anyway, the food is delicious.

64
00:07:42.277 --> 00:07:43.378
- Cheers. - Right, cheers.

65
00:08:10.438 --> 00:08:13.537
My gosh.

66
00:08:21.417 --> 00:08:22.477
Gosh.

67
00:08:24.847 --> 00:08:26.087
That's what I call fine weather.

68
00:08:27.287 --> 00:08:30.717
What a beautiful day.

69
00:08:52.578 --> 00:08:55.118
Yoon Jae Young, you dirty rat.

70
00:09:00.118 --> 00:09:03.388
You ask my mom to babysit whenever you feel like it...

71
00:09:03.818 --> 00:09:05.958
and toss your laundry in my basket.

72
00:09:06.157 --> 00:09:07.627
That's low even for a jerk like you.

73
00:09:08.198 --> 00:09:11.357
I can't toss it in your mom's since she does Do Ah's laundry for me.

74
00:09:11.357 --> 00:09:12.997
I'm not a piece of trash, you know.

75
00:09:13.528 --> 00:09:16.267
What kind of excuse is that?

76
00:09:16.467 --> 00:09:19.808
How dare you toss your dirty laundry in my basket?

77
00:09:20.107 --> 00:09:21.267
Good morning.

78
00:09:23.877 --> 00:09:27.208
Jae Young, your tie wasn't straight.

79
00:09:31.078 --> 00:09:32.247
Here's your morning coffee.

80
00:09:32.987 --> 00:09:34.387
Are you here to pick me up?

81
00:09:36.357 --> 00:09:38.487
I'm not one to wait around for others,

82
00:09:39.288 --> 00:09:40.387
but are you touched?

83
00:09:43.127 --> 00:09:44.227
Gosh, that's cheesy.

84
00:09:46.328 --> 00:09:48.798
You must be carpooling today.

85
00:09:48.938 --> 00:09:50.038
That's nice.

86
00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:53.668
Something like that.

87
00:09:54.668 --> 00:09:57.708
- Anyway, we'll get going. - Sure. Have a good day.

88
00:09:58.308 --> 00:10:00.148
- Bye, then. - Sure. It was good to see you.

89
00:10:00.148 --> 00:10:01.247
Have a good morning.

90
00:10:11.087 --> 00:10:12.288
What on earth?

91
00:10:12.288 --> 00:10:14.587
You look even prettier today, my friend.

92
00:10:14.958 --> 00:10:16.528
Did you just call me your friend?

93
00:10:17.127 --> 00:10:18.428
My girlfriend.

94
00:10:23.168 --> 00:10:26.967
- Gosh. - I've been losing my hair lately.

95
00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:28.038
- Could you check? - Where?

96
00:10:28.038 --> 00:10:29.137
- Here. - Here?

97
00:10:29.137 --> 00:10:30.377
Yes, right there.

98
00:10:31.337 --> 00:10:33.308
I'm intoxicated by you...

99
00:10:34.578 --> 00:10:36.747
to the point of my hair falling out.

100
00:10:42.387 --> 00:10:44.757
He must be insane.

101
00:10:46.587 --> 00:10:47.658
Get back here.

102
00:10:50.497 --> 00:10:51.727
Are you kidding me?

103
00:10:51.727 --> 00:10:54.127
- What was that? - Hop in.

104
00:10:54.367 --> 00:10:55.467
Sure.

105
00:11:11.648 --> 00:11:13.487
Ms. Choi, hi.

106
00:11:13.887 --> 00:11:15.257
Good morning.

107
00:11:16.558 --> 00:11:17.958
What's with the bike?

108
00:11:18.087 --> 00:11:20.158
I ride it to work.

109
00:11:21.288 --> 00:11:22.898
Is it a dream of yours to be a guy...

110
00:11:22.898 --> 00:11:24.627
who rides a bike to work while wearing a backpack?

111
00:11:24.997 --> 00:11:26.627
Your legs will turn into jelly.

112
00:11:26.627 --> 00:11:27.698
Right...

113
00:11:31.668 --> 00:11:32.867
It's to save money on transportation.

114
00:11:33.568 --> 00:11:37.337
I have deposited 800 dollars twice in my installment savings account.

115
00:11:37.337 --> 00:11:39.007
The ring is 900 dollars,

116
00:11:39.007 --> 00:11:41.678
so if I divide it by 12 months, it'll be 75 dollars.

117
00:11:41.678 --> 00:11:42.877
When there's no interest, of course.

118
00:11:43.418 --> 00:11:45.847
If I'm able to save 60 dollars on transportation,

119
00:11:46.418 --> 00:11:49.658
I only have to pay 15 dollars a month for the ring.

120
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.487
Why are you telling me that detail?

121
00:11:52.857 --> 00:11:55.398
Is it to make me uncomfortable?

122
00:11:56.458 --> 00:11:59.627
You asked why I rode the bike to work,

123
00:11:59.627 --> 00:12:01.737
so I was giving you an answer.

124
00:12:02.168 --> 00:12:03.938
I apologize if it made you uncomfortable.

125
00:12:04.267 --> 00:12:05.507
I'll get going then.

126
00:12:10.078 --> 00:12:12.808
Maybe I should rethink how I feel about him.

127
00:12:13.448 --> 00:12:16.117
He's naive and gullible, but not in a good way.

128
00:12:17.448 --> 00:12:18.717
Did I have to mention the brand?

129
00:12:18.717 --> 00:12:20.648
I only have myself to blame.

130
00:12:36.737 --> 00:12:38.068
I'll walk you to the entrance.

131
00:12:38.438 --> 00:12:40.737
What if someone sees us?

132
00:12:40.737 --> 00:12:42.308
So what if they do?

133
00:12:42.308 --> 00:12:44.908
We're a couple now, so we should keep it on the down-low.

134
00:12:46.448 --> 00:12:47.648
A couple?

135
00:12:49.778 --> 00:12:53.318
Would I reject you after all this time?

136
00:12:54.448 --> 00:12:56.958
How could I when you confessed to me...

137
00:12:57.757 --> 00:13:00.458
with that sweet kiss?

138
00:13:00.857 --> 00:13:02.627
Must office romances...

139
00:13:02.627 --> 00:13:04.227
be a secret?

140
00:13:04.257 --> 00:13:06.168
I've never had one before.

141
00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:07.867
Me neither.

142
00:13:08.597 --> 00:13:12.467
I want to brag about you.

143
00:13:12.967 --> 00:13:15.678
You said you wouldn't fall for me. What made you fall for me?

144
00:13:18.278 --> 00:13:21.977
Every time you were embarrassed in front of me.

145
00:13:22.617 --> 00:13:25.847
I fell for you every time you acted like a dingbat.

146
00:13:27.847 --> 00:13:29.958
But I can't act like a dingbat.

147
00:13:33.188 --> 00:13:35.127
I'm worried now.

148
00:13:35.497 --> 00:13:38.198
What do I do with this guy? He called me a dingbat.

149
00:13:38.568 --> 00:13:39.597
Wait.

150
00:13:39.828 --> 00:13:42.398
I won't worry about it anymore.

151
00:13:43.068 --> 00:13:46.408
I've crossed the line, and there's no turning back.

152
00:13:49.477 --> 00:13:50.708
If by chance...

153
00:13:53.448 --> 00:13:54.578
you end up...

154
00:13:56.078 --> 00:13:58.117
being disappointed in me,

155
00:13:59.648 --> 00:14:01.117
don't stop...

156
00:14:02.418 --> 00:14:04.188
liking me, okay?

157
00:14:05.788 --> 00:14:07.227
What about you?

158
00:14:09.698 --> 00:14:11.227
I'm confident.

159
00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:14.698
I know myself, and I trust myself.

160
00:14:15.298 --> 00:14:17.737
Even if something happens to me, I'll stand firm.

161
00:14:18.168 --> 00:14:21.568
So you can't stop adoring me.

162
00:14:22.377 --> 00:14:23.837
Fine. I promise.

163
00:14:24.038 --> 00:14:26.778
- Promise. - Let's not get caught,

164
00:14:26.778 --> 00:14:28.977
and have a sweet relationship for a long time.

165
00:14:32.887 --> 00:14:34.548
Oh, my gosh.

166
00:14:35.757 --> 00:14:36.788
What's going on?

167
00:14:37.188 --> 00:14:39.558
- Look at them. - I can't watch.

168
00:14:40.158 --> 00:14:44.328
(Episode 9: The Moments That We Say It's Love)

169
00:14:45.367 --> 00:14:46.668
Hello.

170
00:14:47.367 --> 00:14:48.438
You're here early.

171
00:14:48.837 --> 00:14:49.997
Tea? Coffee?

172
00:14:49.997 --> 00:14:51.237
I already had.

173
00:14:51.568 --> 00:14:54.267
It's nice and slow since we met the deadline, isn't it?

174
00:14:59.808 --> 00:15:00.908
Let's see.

175
00:15:06.148 --> 00:15:08.048
- Soo Chul. - Yes?

176
00:15:22.538 --> 00:15:23.698
Don't kill me.

177
00:15:24.237 --> 00:15:27.137
I wanted to stick you and Ha Ri together.

178
00:15:27.137 --> 00:15:29.678
I really wasn't slacking off. Hey.

179
00:15:29.678 --> 00:15:32.507
I get rashes, and it gets itchy when I keep wearing it.

180
00:15:32.507 --> 00:15:35.078
It was too frustrating to watch the two of you.

181
00:15:35.078 --> 00:15:37.548
That's why I went as far as... I'm sorry.

182
00:15:42.087 --> 00:15:43.818
Thank you.

183
00:15:44.087 --> 00:15:45.658
- What? - You're the best.

184
00:15:46.987 --> 00:15:48.528
I'll stick to her.

185
00:15:49.398 --> 00:15:52.127
I'll stick to her 52 hours a week.

186
00:15:54.727 --> 00:15:56.398
Hold on. Are you two...

187
00:15:56.867 --> 00:15:59.737
Are you no longer a self-declared bachelor?

188
00:16:00.267 --> 00:16:01.668
Ha Ri doesn't want to get married either.

189
00:16:03.477 --> 00:16:04.578
What about kids?

190
00:16:07.408 --> 00:16:09.747
What about Ha Ri's baby?

191
00:16:14.788 --> 00:16:15.958
We'll have to believe in miracles.

192
00:16:23.727 --> 00:16:26.398
I've been losing my hair lately.

193
00:16:26.398 --> 00:16:27.698
- Here? - Yes, right there.

194
00:16:28.097 --> 00:16:31.398
I'm intoxicated by you...

195
00:16:32.507 --> 00:16:33.708
to the point of my hair falling out.

196
00:16:44.048 --> 00:16:47.587
(Nitwit)

197
00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:54.257
Hey, it's me.

198
00:16:54.788 --> 00:16:56.757
You'll come for Do Ah's first birthday photoshoot, right?

199
00:16:57.928 --> 00:16:59.127
Come.

200
00:16:59.127 --> 00:17:01.798
You recommended the place to me.

201
00:17:02.267 --> 00:17:04.767
Let's eat and watch a movie afterward.

202
00:17:05.137 --> 00:17:06.938
Why would I watch a movie with you?

203
00:17:08.938 --> 00:17:12.808
You promised you would, so keep your word!

204
00:17:19.617 --> 00:17:22.617
He went from a beggar to a stubborn mule.

205
00:17:22.617 --> 00:17:24.387
Give me a break.

206
00:17:26.887 --> 00:17:29.597
You are so childish.

207
00:17:34.528 --> 00:17:36.237
"Keep your word."

208
00:17:38.068 --> 00:17:40.307
Ha Ri! What's going on?

209
00:17:40.408 --> 00:17:42.178
- You and Mr. Han... - Hey!

210
00:17:42.178 --> 00:17:44.037
I saw you eating together,

211
00:17:44.037 --> 00:17:46.807
holding hands, and doing all sorts of things with my own eyes.

212
00:17:47.348 --> 00:17:48.408
The two of you were totally...

213
00:17:48.408 --> 00:17:49.648
Oh, my gosh!

214
00:17:49.648 --> 00:17:51.178
You. Get in here.

215
00:17:54.088 --> 00:17:55.118
Come on.

216
00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:56.987
Get over here.

217
00:18:05.028 --> 00:18:06.097
What is it?

218
00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:08.528
Why do you suddenly look like a bully?

219
00:18:08.528 --> 00:18:11.528
I never experienced this even when I was in school.

220
00:18:11.968 --> 00:18:13.738
This is expensive.

221
00:18:14.738 --> 00:18:15.907
Is the word out already?

222
00:18:17.568 --> 00:18:18.677
How much did you hear?

223
00:18:20.907 --> 00:18:22.447
Hold on.

224
00:18:24.778 --> 00:18:26.478
How far did you go?

225
00:18:27.147 --> 00:18:28.788
I didn't go...

226
00:18:28.788 --> 00:18:30.447
I didn't go anywhere.

227
00:18:30.447 --> 00:18:32.058
We didn't do anything.

228
00:18:32.558 --> 00:18:35.157
You were doing a lot of stuff outside.

229
00:18:35.558 --> 00:18:36.687
Let's cut her some slack.

230
00:18:37.028 --> 00:18:38.488
She said they're "we".

231
00:18:38.857 --> 00:18:41.397
Okay, good. That's good!

232
00:18:41.397 --> 00:18:42.768
- Ha Ri. - Yes.

233
00:18:42.768 --> 00:18:44.028
- Okay. - Good.

234
00:18:44.028 --> 00:18:46.667
You did great. I had lost all hope for you.

235
00:18:47.397 --> 00:18:48.708
Good luck.

236
00:18:49.008 --> 00:18:52.377
So... Let's end this gossip...

237
00:18:52.808 --> 00:18:54.238
with you guys.

238
00:18:54.508 --> 00:18:57.048
I received enough attention at the office already.

239
00:18:57.347 --> 00:19:00.578
It has been a day. I don't want it to be ruined by rumors.

240
00:19:00.748 --> 00:19:02.417
I want this to last long.

241
00:19:03.647 --> 00:19:05.018
Eternal love?

242
00:19:06.117 --> 00:19:08.258
Love that lasts 100 years?

243
00:19:09.087 --> 00:19:11.288
I know that we are...

244
00:19:11.288 --> 00:19:13.897
always a month behind in finding out the gossip,

245
00:19:14.058 --> 00:19:16.798
but we are astute when we do notice.

246
00:19:16.867 --> 00:19:18.097
You should be careful.

247
00:19:18.127 --> 00:19:20.068
Of course. I'll be careful.

248
00:19:20.937 --> 00:19:24.167
Then has Ms. Jang's pregnancy project...

249
00:19:24.167 --> 00:19:25.637
come to a close?

250
00:19:25.837 --> 00:19:28.508
Wait. I Sang doesn't like...

251
00:19:29.008 --> 00:19:30.078
children.

252
00:19:30.877 --> 00:19:31.947
What?

253
00:19:33.318 --> 00:19:36.788
Everyone in the company and the nation knows you want a kid.

254
00:19:36.788 --> 00:19:38.488
- I'm sure he's thinking about it. - I agree.

255
00:19:38.887 --> 00:19:39.988
Right?

256
00:19:40.318 --> 00:19:43.887
Isn't the goal a shotgun wedding?

257
00:19:45.798 --> 00:19:48.028
I know I have to work quickly,

258
00:19:48.798 --> 00:19:52.197
but it's too soon to talk about babies one day into dating.

259
00:19:52.667 --> 00:19:56.637
But then again, I feel like we'll face it eventually.

260
00:19:57.137 --> 00:20:00.377
We are quite old, and we've already kissed...

261
00:20:00.907 --> 00:20:02.347
- You've kissed? - You kissed him?

262
00:20:02.347 --> 00:20:03.708
- You've kissed? - My gosh!

263
00:20:03.708 --> 00:20:05.347
- My gosh! - It's game over!

264
00:20:05.347 --> 00:20:07.647
- That's so awesome! - Yes!

265
00:20:07.647 --> 00:20:09.087
- This is huge! - Seriously!

266
00:20:09.318 --> 00:20:11.117
- Congratulations. - Oh, my gosh.

267
00:20:11.117 --> 00:20:13.587
- It's a done deal. - Stop it.

268
00:20:13.818 --> 00:20:15.218
- Yes! - Yes!

269
00:20:15.988 --> 00:20:17.058
Yes!

270
00:20:17.828 --> 00:20:19.958
You said you'd handle it!

271
00:20:21.127 --> 00:20:23.298
Do you call this "handling it"?

272
00:20:23.568 --> 00:20:26.437
How many times must I tell you?

273
00:20:27.367 --> 00:20:28.367
Get out.

274
00:20:31.437 --> 00:20:33.578
He can't do anything right.

275
00:20:48.687 --> 00:20:50.627
(My daughter)

276
00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:54.927
Hey.

277
00:20:56.298 --> 00:20:58.468
Hi. What's up?

278
00:21:00.937 --> 00:21:02.068
London?

279
00:21:03.167 --> 00:21:05.137
You can't go there alone.

280
00:21:06.607 --> 00:21:08.508
I can't skip work.

281
00:21:08.778 --> 00:21:11.377
Does she have to get lessons from a professor?

282
00:21:11.478 --> 00:21:14.078
Yes, I can use my vacation days during the summer,

283
00:21:14.278 --> 00:21:16.187
but there are some stuff going on at work.

284
00:21:16.318 --> 00:21:18.387
She's still in grade school.

285
00:21:18.788 --> 00:21:20.988
Why are you preparing for her college application already?

286
00:21:21.718 --> 00:21:23.587
Anyway, I feel too bad...

287
00:21:23.587 --> 00:21:25.798
to take a trip and things like that.

288
00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:28.427
I never said I'm not proud of her.

289
00:21:28.427 --> 00:21:30.897
Yes, I want her to become the next Mozart too.

290
00:21:31.828 --> 00:21:32.867
What?

291
00:21:32.897 --> 00:21:34.998
Mozart didn't play the flute?

292
00:21:35.298 --> 00:21:38.568
Anyway, let's stay within our means.

293
00:21:39.677 --> 00:21:40.978
I'm...

294
00:21:40.978 --> 00:21:43.107
- Things are just too hard. - It's too hard.

295
00:21:48.988 --> 00:21:51.087
- Let's talk at home. - Let's talk later.

296
00:22:05.268 --> 00:22:06.337
Go ahead.

297
00:22:07.038 --> 00:22:08.137
Okay.

298
00:22:10.437 --> 00:22:11.508
Yes.

299
00:22:14.808 --> 00:22:18.278
Yes, I'm on my way up.

300
00:22:18.578 --> 00:22:21.177
I'm on my way too. Take your time.

301
00:22:23.018 --> 00:22:24.988
I'm on my way to see you.

302
00:22:28.018 --> 00:22:29.187
I'm going down now.

303
00:22:33.498 --> 00:22:34.597
You're coming, right?

304
00:22:35.328 --> 00:22:36.627
Just a second.

305
00:22:39.897 --> 00:22:42.468
- Where are the seniors? - I don't know. They all left.

306
00:22:44.068 --> 00:22:45.238
Here you go.

307
00:22:45.238 --> 00:22:46.877
Thank you.

308
00:22:46.877 --> 00:22:48.677
Change of plans. Change of plans.

309
00:22:48.847 --> 00:22:50.778
Let's meet on the first floor.

310
00:22:51.847 --> 00:22:52.947
Is someone there?

311
00:22:53.318 --> 00:22:55.218
The employees usually don't take the stairs.

312
00:22:55.847 --> 00:22:57.518
Do you think there's another couple at work?

313
00:22:57.788 --> 00:22:59.318
Maybe.

314
00:23:01.218 --> 00:23:03.028
This is our spot.

315
00:23:03.587 --> 00:23:04.887
Go somewhere else.

316
00:23:08.197 --> 00:23:10.597
- Those punks. - It's delicious.

317
00:23:18.538 --> 00:23:20.308
You brought lunch?

318
00:23:20.578 --> 00:23:22.008
Yes, so I can save my lunch money.

319
00:23:22.278 --> 00:23:24.578
Let's say I normally spend eight dollars for lunch.

320
00:23:24.677 --> 00:23:26.048
And sometimes, I even eat dinner.

321
00:23:26.147 --> 00:23:28.778
So if I save about 300 dollars every month,

322
00:23:29.048 --> 00:23:30.887
it'll only take six months...

323
00:23:31.347 --> 00:23:33.357
for me to make up for the money I spent on buying the ring.

324
00:23:35.018 --> 00:23:37.728
Then don't buy a Cartier ring.

325
00:23:38.127 --> 00:23:39.597
Just get an 18k ring.

326
00:23:39.828 --> 00:23:42.197
You're saving so much money just to get that ring.

327
00:23:43.468 --> 00:23:45.768
To be honest, this is my first time asking someone out.

328
00:23:47.498 --> 00:23:48.937
So I want to do a good job.

329
00:23:53.478 --> 00:23:57.347
I've never liked someone this much.

330
00:23:57.808 --> 00:23:59.877
And I really want her to like me...

331
00:24:01.278 --> 00:24:02.788
and my proposal.

332
00:24:05.988 --> 00:24:07.117
I seem like a fool, don't I?

333
00:24:09.627 --> 00:24:12.397
Yes. I mean, I had no idea...

334
00:24:12.397 --> 00:24:14.157
you could be such a fool.

335
00:24:14.958 --> 00:24:16.427
Will this do?

336
00:24:17.068 --> 00:24:18.498
Let's go eat something delicious.

337
00:24:19.337 --> 00:24:21.068
No, it's okay.

338
00:24:21.068 --> 00:24:22.837
I'll be able to save money.

339
00:24:22.837 --> 00:24:24.568
(Emergency Tteokbokki)

340
00:24:28.508 --> 00:24:30.847
Everything tastes delicious when I'm with you.

341
00:24:36.087 --> 00:24:38.647
Is it yummy, my sweetheart?

342
00:24:38.647 --> 00:24:41.958
You have sauce all over your mouth. My goodness.

343
00:24:41.958 --> 00:24:43.228
You're so cute.

344
00:24:43.728 --> 00:24:45.458
You're so adorable.

345
00:24:47.197 --> 00:24:50.197
But I have to say, this is very exciting.

346
00:24:50.498 --> 00:24:54.167
I looked it up online, and couples meet in front of the copy machine...

347
00:24:54.268 --> 00:24:56.667
and in the lounge to have short dates.

348
00:24:57.937 --> 00:24:59.877
But your journalist colleagues know about us.

349
00:25:00.177 --> 00:25:01.437
Soo Chul knows as well.

350
00:25:01.637 --> 00:25:03.177
Are you sure this is a secret?

351
00:25:03.347 --> 00:25:04.847
But they're the only ones.

352
00:25:05.177 --> 00:25:08.617
They're my people, so they're very loyal.

353
00:25:09.917 --> 00:25:13.857
But you're too obvious, Ha Ri. Everyone will notice because of you.

354
00:25:15.728 --> 00:25:18.887
You're going to call me Ha Ri now?

355
00:25:21.028 --> 00:25:24.627
If you want a nickname, I can call you Cutie Pie.

356
00:25:24.627 --> 00:25:26.137
Gosh, that's terrible.

357
00:25:27.337 --> 00:25:29.038
I tend to be a bit brusque.

358
00:25:29.568 --> 00:25:32.337
So I don't know how to say stuff like "Ha Ri wants this."

359
00:25:33.038 --> 00:25:36.208
My gosh, this is bad.

360
00:25:36.508 --> 00:25:38.107
This is really bad.

361
00:25:38.107 --> 00:25:40.218
You're so cute that it's making me angry.

362
00:25:40.877 --> 00:25:42.687
I better be the only person who gets to see this.

363
00:25:42.687 --> 00:25:44.988
You'd better not act so cute...

364
00:25:45.187 --> 00:25:46.857
in front of other people, okay?

365
00:25:49.828 --> 00:25:53.427
But don't you think we'll get caught eating here?

366
00:25:55.328 --> 00:25:57.197
There's a tteokbokki restaurant right in front of the office.

367
00:25:57.367 --> 00:26:00.568
Plus, we're colleagues. We can eat together.

368
00:26:01.238 --> 00:26:04.867
It's not like we got caught kissing.

369
00:26:12.548 --> 00:26:15.318
My goodness.

370
00:26:16.887 --> 00:26:17.988
Ms. Jang.

371
00:26:22.788 --> 00:26:24.488
We played a game to decide who gets to pay.

372
00:26:24.687 --> 00:26:26.498
The first person to scream is the loser.

373
00:26:26.498 --> 00:26:27.798
But we tied, so let's each pay half.

374
00:26:27.798 --> 00:26:28.927
Move.

375
00:26:30.798 --> 00:26:31.927
My gosh, they startled me.

376
00:26:33.468 --> 00:26:36.208
Let me tell you something since you already know.

377
00:26:36.407 --> 00:26:37.738
This is very thrilling.

378
00:26:41.937 --> 00:26:44.778
Gosh, I don't know what that was about.

379
00:26:45.147 --> 00:26:46.518
But it looks fun.

380
00:26:46.917 --> 00:26:48.917
We should also do it sometime.

381
00:26:50.288 --> 00:26:52.857
I don't know what you're talking about, but sure.

382
00:26:56.887 --> 00:26:58.458
- What? - It's going to be so fun.

383
00:27:01.697 --> 00:27:05.028
I'm sorry. If I didn't pinch you hard enough,

384
00:27:05.568 --> 00:27:07.097
I was worried it might not seem real.

385
00:27:07.798 --> 00:27:08.837
It's okay.

386
00:27:09.337 --> 00:27:11.937
But I have to say, you're very strong.

387
00:27:19.248 --> 00:27:21.417
I'm going to be doing a shoot with Kang Hyo Joo.

388
00:27:21.748 --> 00:27:24.387
She needs to exercise so she can look nice for the shoot,

389
00:27:25.187 --> 00:27:26.857
so it'll be around next month.

390
00:27:27.288 --> 00:27:28.387
Kang Hyo Joo?

391
00:27:29.788 --> 00:27:30.887
What's wrong?

392
00:27:31.758 --> 00:27:32.828
Should I not do it?

393
00:27:32.998 --> 00:27:34.197
Oh, come on.

394
00:27:34.197 --> 00:27:36.667
I'm a professional when it comes to work.

395
00:27:36.998 --> 00:27:40.197
I hope you do a great job. Enough to make me get jealous.

396
00:27:40.837 --> 00:27:44.337
My girlfriend really is the best.

397
00:27:44.708 --> 00:27:45.907
You're such a pro.

398
00:27:46.278 --> 00:27:48.377
- You're amazing. - Yes, I know.

399
00:27:48.478 --> 00:27:52.407
What's the point of asking us to keep our mouths shut?

400
00:27:52.917 --> 00:27:55.887
Yawn, burp, sneeze, and love.

401
00:27:56.488 --> 00:27:57.718
You can't hide those four.

402
00:27:59.357 --> 00:28:00.917
Love falls under that category?

403
00:28:01.117 --> 00:28:04.387
Love is an instinct.

404
00:28:05.998 --> 00:28:07.058
My gosh.

405
00:28:07.498 --> 00:28:08.897
But still, burping is too gross.

406
00:28:18.607 --> 00:28:19.738
What's the matter with me?

407
00:28:29.387 --> 00:28:30.488
Goodbye.

408
00:28:44.498 --> 00:28:45.627
You look happy.

409
00:28:46.068 --> 00:28:50.337
- What are you doing outside? - Are you really dating that punk?

410
00:28:50.337 --> 00:28:51.808
Don't call him "that punk".

411
00:28:52.137 --> 00:28:54.738
Call him Mr. Han or I Sang.

412
00:28:54.738 --> 00:28:58.107
Okay, fine. Did you and Mr. Han...

413
00:28:58.248 --> 00:29:00.518
actually start dating each other?

414
00:29:00.518 --> 00:29:03.518
Then do you think I'd be fooling around with him at my age?

415
00:29:03.788 --> 00:29:05.518
I've waited 10 years to date someone like him.

416
00:29:07.617 --> 00:29:09.887
Yesterday was our first day.

417
00:29:13.758 --> 00:29:16.068
First day, my foot.

418
00:29:16.068 --> 00:29:17.397
Why are you counting days?

419
00:29:17.498 --> 00:29:19.867
So you can check how long it'll take for you to break up?

420
00:29:20.197 --> 00:29:21.697
Are you picking a fight because you're lonely?

421
00:29:21.798 --> 00:29:24.367
I'm counting so we'll last thousands of days together.

422
00:29:24.568 --> 00:29:27.107
Gosh, you're so annoying.

423
00:29:28.677 --> 00:29:32.248
- Come to Do Ah's photoshoot. - Gosh, okay.

424
00:29:32.248 --> 00:29:33.377
You promised, okay?

425
00:29:38.887 --> 00:29:40.288
That little punk.

426
00:29:56.708 --> 00:30:00.078
We need to do a reshoot of the photoshoot we did last time.

427
00:30:01.708 --> 00:30:02.778
Why?

428
00:30:02.778 --> 00:30:06.417
We even received designer clothes for the photoshoot.

429
00:30:06.518 --> 00:30:08.218
But the clothes are too fancy.

430
00:30:08.548 --> 00:30:11.218
What's so weird about kids having fun wearing designer clothes?

431
00:30:11.548 --> 00:30:12.818
Is this coming from Ms. Jang?

432
00:30:13.117 --> 00:30:14.758
Who else would it be?

433
00:30:18.587 --> 00:30:20.427
She's unbelievable.

434
00:30:20.657 --> 00:30:22.528
What? Who?

435
00:30:22.897 --> 00:30:24.298
Ha... Ha Ri?

436
00:30:24.627 --> 00:30:25.768
Her judgment...

437
00:30:28.798 --> 00:30:30.068
is right on point.

438
00:30:30.337 --> 00:30:32.008
I can't say "no" to this.

439
00:30:34.278 --> 00:30:37.708
Gosh, your reaction is so corny.

440
00:30:38.347 --> 00:30:41.318
You've gone nuts.

441
00:30:41.377 --> 00:30:44.488
Thanks to her, we'll get to do a reshoot.

442
00:30:47.458 --> 00:30:51.087
Then let me give you a word of advice in return.

443
00:30:51.627 --> 00:30:54.958
Ha Ri wishes to drive on the Autobahn.

444
00:30:55.627 --> 00:30:57.328
Her dream is to get pregnant before getting married.

445
00:30:57.328 --> 00:30:59.667
But she's very shy and romantic.

446
00:30:59.667 --> 00:31:01.597
So she's probably sticking to the speed limit.

447
00:31:03.137 --> 00:31:05.137
You get what I mean, right?

448
00:31:29.228 --> 00:31:31.197
What if you meet someone you love?

449
00:31:32.167 --> 00:31:33.998
And what if there's an unexpected pregnancy?

450
00:31:35.498 --> 00:31:38.308
So you've never once wanted to be a dad?

451
00:32:00.028 --> 00:32:03.298
Eu Ddeum almost caught them kissing while eating tteokbokki.

452
00:32:03.397 --> 00:32:06.468
Seung Ho and I almost caught them in the staircase.

453
00:32:07.798 --> 00:32:10.008
Maybe they don't know what a secret relationship is.

454
00:32:10.308 --> 00:32:12.008
Maybe they want to get caught.

455
00:32:17.677 --> 00:32:18.748
Guys.

456
00:32:21.518 --> 00:32:23.988
You're obviously texting about me, aren't you?

457
00:32:28.387 --> 00:32:31.187
The fact that you all stopped typing proves my suspicion.

458
00:32:31.558 --> 00:32:33.058
Unbelievable.

459
00:32:36.397 --> 00:32:37.927
- Ha Ri. - Yes?

460
00:32:38.268 --> 00:32:40.538
There's a notice on the company bulletin board.

461
00:32:41.167 --> 00:32:44.238
Sure. Let's take a look.

462
00:32:44.738 --> 00:32:46.808
(Personnel Transfer)

463
00:32:48.337 --> 00:32:52.107
(Deputy Manager to Acting Editor-in-chief: Jang Ha Ri)

464
00:33:07.397 --> 00:33:08.627
(Personnel Transfer)

465
00:33:11.167 --> 00:33:12.268
Mr. Kim.

466
00:33:17.068 --> 00:33:18.137
We need to talk.

467
00:33:28.478 --> 00:33:30.988
Why are you being like Ms. Shim?

468
00:33:31.748 --> 00:33:33.687
Could you stop glaring at me like that?

469
00:33:35.357 --> 00:33:37.028
Tell me everything you know.

470
00:33:37.988 --> 00:33:38.988
About what?

471
00:33:39.427 --> 00:33:40.697
Being the minority here,

472
00:33:40.697 --> 00:33:43.297
I know the male employees have been bonding on their own.

473
00:33:44.498 --> 00:33:47.168
You knew how I'd react...

474
00:33:47.168 --> 00:33:49.297
to this recent personnel appointment...

475
00:33:49.567 --> 00:33:51.907
and have probably thought of what to say to me.

476
00:33:52.007 --> 00:33:55.478
It seems like you're on board with the decision.

477
00:33:59.648 --> 00:34:02.887
I had no idea that you were this smart.

478
00:34:03.918 --> 00:34:07.458
I have always been showing my smarts around here.

479
00:34:08.018 --> 00:34:09.458
My temper too.

480
00:34:14.358 --> 00:34:15.498
Who is it going to be?

481
00:34:17.398 --> 00:34:19.197
They're looking for an outside hire.

482
00:34:20.168 --> 00:34:22.737
Someone with a successful career in advertisement.

483
00:34:24.737 --> 00:34:26.108
I felt awful too, you know.

484
00:34:27.007 --> 00:34:30.648
Truth be told, I wanted to take your side on this,

485
00:34:31.007 --> 00:34:34.847
but how could I say anything when my job could be on the line?

486
00:34:35.447 --> 00:34:38.347
I have a family to provide for. If you consider my age...

487
00:34:38.788 --> 00:34:39.958
and my career,

488
00:34:40.458 --> 00:34:43.088
I wouldn't be hired anywhere else.

489
00:34:43.088 --> 00:34:44.987
The same goes for me too.

490
00:34:47.898 --> 00:34:49.328
Darn it.

491
00:34:54.768 --> 00:34:57.067
- May I go now? - Darn.

492
00:34:57.637 --> 00:34:58.867
I'm sorry.

493
00:35:04.507 --> 00:35:05.907
You've got to be kidding me.

494
00:35:12.018 --> 00:35:14.558
Soo Chul told me.

495
00:35:15.257 --> 00:35:16.887
Do you want me there?

496
00:35:19.927 --> 00:35:21.558
(Han I Sang)

497
00:35:23.498 --> 00:35:27.467
(It's all right. I'm not worried of anything now since I have you.)

498
00:35:44.148 --> 00:35:47.487
Seeing as you're here in the middle of a weekday...

499
00:35:47.487 --> 00:35:49.257
must mean that you don't work in an office.

500
00:35:51.128 --> 00:35:54.197
I'm a freelance photographer. Someone who takes photographs.

501
00:35:55.898 --> 00:35:57.498
How cool.

502
00:35:58.628 --> 00:36:01.398
What made you want to learn leather crafting?

503
00:36:01.768 --> 00:36:05.308
It's a hobby of mine to try activities I'm new at.

504
00:36:06.338 --> 00:36:07.637
Me too.

505
00:36:08.137 --> 00:36:09.478
There are just so many things...

506
00:36:09.478 --> 00:36:10.847
I didn't have time for when I was young.

507
00:36:11.007 --> 00:36:13.447
At this age, there's nothing more to do...

508
00:36:13.447 --> 00:36:14.978
than do what you love, right?

509
00:36:18.648 --> 00:36:22.418
I only started this because my life got boring.

510
00:36:23.128 --> 00:36:25.588
Providing some kind of meaning to life...

511
00:36:26.427 --> 00:36:28.027
was the only way to keep going.

512
00:36:29.967 --> 00:36:31.998
It's strange how someone so younger than me...

513
00:36:32.697 --> 00:36:34.567
share the same thoughts.

514
00:36:36.097 --> 00:36:38.338
Are you married?

515
00:36:38.768 --> 00:36:41.277
I haven't gotten around to that yet.

516
00:36:41.677 --> 00:36:44.677
This is great news. You see, I know someone...

517
00:36:44.677 --> 00:36:46.447
who's about to inherit a building.

518
00:36:46.478 --> 00:36:48.047
Would you like to meet her?

519
00:36:51.088 --> 00:36:53.858
She may not be inheriting a building,

520
00:36:54.018 --> 00:36:57.058
but I have a girlfriend who is the prettiest.

521
00:36:57.588 --> 00:36:59.128
We just started dating,

522
00:36:59.657 --> 00:37:02.027
but I need to be good to her...

523
00:37:02.498 --> 00:37:05.927
so that she decides to stay with me forever.

524
00:37:07.038 --> 00:37:08.237
Is that so?

525
00:37:09.268 --> 00:37:11.438
You should've hinted at a girlfriend...

526
00:37:11.438 --> 00:37:13.538
instead of making me think you had a sob story.

527
00:37:28.657 --> 00:37:29.858
Ms. Jang,

528
00:37:30.788 --> 00:37:32.628
this is irresponsible of you.

529
00:37:32.858 --> 00:37:35.328
"The Baby" was published 30 years ago...

530
00:37:35.498 --> 00:37:37.367
and I have been around for 15.

531
00:37:37.628 --> 00:37:39.427
I have worked on every single issue since joining.

532
00:37:40.097 --> 00:37:43.168
Yes, I know. It's why I'm highly fond of you.

533
00:37:43.608 --> 00:37:45.567
But this is a different matter.

534
00:37:45.567 --> 00:37:47.137
I'm doing what's best for the company,

535
00:37:47.137 --> 00:37:48.677
so it's too bad if you feel disappointed.

536
00:37:50.078 --> 00:37:53.518
It's why I suggested you move to a different department.

537
00:37:54.777 --> 00:37:56.547
Anyway, until another spot clears up,

538
00:37:57.217 --> 00:37:59.418
stay at "The Baby" and then switch positions.

539
00:38:03.018 --> 00:38:05.828
You clearly don't see me as editor-in-chief material,

540
00:38:05.828 --> 00:38:07.058
so I should resign.

541
00:38:08.927 --> 00:38:10.467
If you quit like this,

542
00:38:10.467 --> 00:38:13.097
who will turn out the upcoming issues?

543
00:38:14.737 --> 00:38:16.467
You announced my position at this very moment...

544
00:38:16.737 --> 00:38:17.938
because you knew I wouldn't dare leave "The Baby" hanging.

545
00:38:22.677 --> 00:38:24.677
How could you use my love for the magazine like this?

546
00:38:27.947 --> 00:38:28.978
Hold on.

547
00:38:29.947 --> 00:38:32.987
If this is because you're upset about the appointment,

548
00:38:33.088 --> 00:38:35.257
tell me what it is you want.

549
00:38:35.858 --> 00:38:37.328
Why would you make a drastic decision...

550
00:38:37.328 --> 00:38:39.858
without trying to negotiate your terms first?

551
00:38:39.858 --> 00:38:42.128
Because editor-in-chief will never be on the table.

552
00:38:43.197 --> 00:38:46.128
Mr. Joo, this isn't because I'm angry.

553
00:38:46.938 --> 00:38:48.867
The trouble I caused was one of the reasons,

554
00:38:48.867 --> 00:38:52.208
but so is the fact that I'm a childless unmarried woman.

555
00:38:52.507 --> 00:38:53.907
If I let my case become a precedent,

556
00:38:53.907 --> 00:38:55.737
other talented but unmarried employees...

557
00:38:55.737 --> 00:38:57.007
will also suffer in the same way.

558
00:38:57.007 --> 00:38:58.648
So how can I not fight this?

559
00:38:58.947 --> 00:39:02.217
Are you saying that the evaluation is unfair?

560
00:39:02.378 --> 00:39:04.688
It should solely be based on character and performance.

561
00:39:05.317 --> 00:39:07.317
If I'm still not the right person for the job,

562
00:39:08.358 --> 00:39:09.657
I'll leave without any regrets.

563
00:39:13.058 --> 00:39:14.757
But Ms. Jang!

564
00:39:29.637 --> 00:39:32.047
Your wrists hurt, right?

565
00:39:32.447 --> 00:39:34.878
I bought another one while buying my own.

566
00:39:37.447 --> 00:39:38.947
Gosh, thank you.

567
00:39:40.088 --> 00:39:41.117
It's no big deal.

568
00:39:49.628 --> 00:39:51.398
He has one lucky girlfriend.

569
00:39:58.967 --> 00:40:00.308
Hello.

570
00:40:03.648 --> 00:40:05.277
Two iced Americanos, please.

571
00:40:05.447 --> 00:40:07.117
Which beans would you like?

572
00:40:08.578 --> 00:40:09.918
Yirgacheffe, please.

573
00:40:10.788 --> 00:40:13.657
Excellent. That's a fine choice.

574
00:40:18.887 --> 00:40:21.558
What's with the medicated patch? Did you hurt yourself?

575
00:40:21.797 --> 00:40:22.998
It's nothing.

576
00:40:25.527 --> 00:40:26.938
Anyway, you made the right choice.

577
00:40:27.268 --> 00:40:29.838
I've always wanted to hand in my resignation like that.

578
00:40:30.407 --> 00:40:31.938
It turned out to be no big deal.

579
00:40:32.268 --> 00:40:35.177
I only wish that I had done it sooner.

580
00:40:35.578 --> 00:40:36.847
I'm proud of you.

581
00:40:37.878 --> 00:40:40.478
Maybe I should've thought it through though.

582
00:40:40.617 --> 00:40:42.748
What about next month's issue?

583
00:40:42.878 --> 00:40:44.487
Will the others be able to handle it?

584
00:40:47.518 --> 00:40:50.288
I may not be a mom, but I'm still just as capable.

585
00:40:50.927 --> 00:40:51.987
Of course.

586
00:40:51.987 --> 00:40:54.097
Why should I endure the insult and contempt?

587
00:40:54.097 --> 00:40:55.458
The insult and contempt?

588
00:40:56.058 --> 00:40:57.067
It's their loss.

589
00:40:57.067 --> 00:40:58.668
Yes, it's their loss.

590
00:41:00.538 --> 00:41:02.838
The others are worried about turning out like me.

591
00:41:03.808 --> 00:41:07.438
Now, I'll be an example of why they should never resign.

592
00:41:16.947 --> 00:41:17.987
What's this?

593
00:41:18.617 --> 00:41:20.317
Ta-da.

594
00:41:21.418 --> 00:41:23.427
I didn't pick it up on the street or anything.

595
00:41:23.588 --> 00:41:24.958
For the first time in my life,

596
00:41:25.387 --> 00:41:29.898
I poured my heart and soul into something homemade.

597
00:41:30.197 --> 00:41:31.398
- Did you make this? - Yes.

598
00:41:45.847 --> 00:41:48.018
- Doctor. - Yes?

599
00:41:48.648 --> 00:41:50.987
What are you doing?

600
00:41:51.847 --> 00:41:52.987
I'm treating a patient...

601
00:41:57.858 --> 00:42:00.797
Sorry about that. You looked like you had a headache.

602
00:42:01.898 --> 00:42:03.668
Okay, let's look at you.

603
00:42:04.527 --> 00:42:06.268
It's okay.

604
00:42:16.608 --> 00:42:18.547
- Doctor. - Yes?

605
00:42:19.047 --> 00:42:20.547
Aren't you going to pick up Do Ah?

606
00:42:20.878 --> 00:42:22.148
It's late.

607
00:42:23.078 --> 00:42:24.148
Yes.

608
00:42:25.487 --> 00:42:26.918
(3 missed calls)

609
00:42:27.788 --> 00:42:30.228
What is wrong with you?

610
00:42:35.498 --> 00:42:38.427
- Let's go. - Bye.

611
00:42:41.438 --> 00:42:43.268
- Hello. - Hello.

612
00:42:43.268 --> 00:42:44.938
I'm sorry. I was bogged down at work.

613
00:42:45.208 --> 00:42:46.838
Where's Do Ah?

614
00:42:47.108 --> 00:42:50.947
I couldn't reach you, so I called your aunt.

615
00:42:51.507 --> 00:42:53.007
She just took her.

616
00:42:54.947 --> 00:42:56.078
My aunt?

617
00:42:57.487 --> 00:42:59.018
- I'm sorry. Okay. - It's okay.

618
00:43:04.628 --> 00:43:06.828
- You sweet thing. - Auntie.

619
00:43:07.697 --> 00:43:10.828
- I'm sorry. I'll take her. - Were you busy at work?

620
00:43:12.427 --> 00:43:15.768
It's okay. I brought the stroller so that I can take her home.

621
00:43:15.967 --> 00:43:18.108
She wouldn't want to stay at a hospital.

622
00:43:18.108 --> 00:43:19.867
She can't shake her cold.

623
00:43:21.538 --> 00:43:23.808
Sorry. I'm only making you and Do Ah suffer.

624
00:43:23.878 --> 00:43:26.648
I never imagined I'd be watching your kid,

625
00:43:27.018 --> 00:43:28.117
but what can I do?

626
00:43:28.817 --> 00:43:30.648
I feel bad for both you and Do Ah.

627
00:43:32.648 --> 00:43:34.157
This isn't what I wanted.

628
00:43:34.918 --> 00:43:36.717
I always realize after I've lost my chance.

629
00:43:39.887 --> 00:43:42.828
You don't have time to be weak when you raise a child alone.

630
00:43:43.427 --> 00:43:45.967
If you get all weak on me, I won't watch Do Ah.

631
00:43:46.427 --> 00:43:49.067
Okay. I'm always grateful.

632
00:43:49.697 --> 00:43:51.838
- Go back. - Okay, bye.

633
00:43:51.838 --> 00:43:52.938
Bye.

634
00:43:53.737 --> 00:43:56.478
Okay, my baby.

635
00:43:57.078 --> 00:43:59.007
Darn it. Seriously.

636
00:44:00.847 --> 00:44:02.777
I don't think he'll call.

637
00:44:02.777 --> 00:44:04.617
Wasn't that his way of telling you to quit?

638
00:44:05.148 --> 00:44:07.188
Did you really talk like you'd quit?

639
00:44:07.188 --> 00:44:09.887
Yes. I had to go all out if I wanted a chance.

640
00:44:10.088 --> 00:44:11.887
And you may really be out.

641
00:44:12.358 --> 00:44:14.898
I guess we'll get a new editor-in-chief.

642
00:44:15.328 --> 00:44:16.657
Why did you do that?

643
00:44:16.657 --> 00:44:18.268
You should've begged as you usually do.

644
00:44:18.268 --> 00:44:19.728
I'll just quit then.

645
00:44:19.728 --> 00:44:21.567
Forget them. I don't need them.

646
00:44:21.697 --> 00:44:24.367
What about us then?

647
00:44:27.708 --> 00:44:30.108
Jang Ha Ri speaking. Yes, sir.

648
00:44:33.277 --> 00:44:34.418
Yes.

649
00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:41.741
So, you just have to get The Mom members back, right?

650
00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:44.582
You know the chairman is sensitive to readers' reactions.

651
00:44:44.852 --> 00:44:46.781
He said they'll make me editor-in-chief...

652
00:44:47.051 --> 00:44:48.422
if I bring back the readers who left.

653
00:44:48.752 --> 00:44:51.951
That sounds like their way of telling you to quit.

654
00:44:52.892 --> 00:44:53.991
- Right? - Yes.

655
00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:55.062
Hey.

656
00:44:55.622 --> 00:44:59.131
It's better than being promoted amidst the readers' protest.

657
00:45:01.562 --> 00:45:05.031
They doubt your skills in coming up with content, so let's go with that.

658
00:45:08.301 --> 00:45:10.341
You're so smart.

659
00:45:13.471 --> 00:45:16.312
There is a story I was thinking of.

660
00:45:17.252 --> 00:45:18.312
Do you think it'll work?

661
00:45:20.352 --> 00:45:21.482
What is it?

662
00:45:25.852 --> 00:45:28.922
We'll make it a competition like this.

663
00:45:31.661 --> 00:45:34.102
Do you think they'd agree to do it?

664
00:45:34.732 --> 00:45:36.161
Even if...

665
00:45:36.161 --> 00:45:37.272
What about...

666
00:45:43.911 --> 00:45:46.042
Yes. That will go here.

667
00:45:48.911 --> 00:45:49.982
So Yoon!

668
00:45:50.582 --> 00:45:51.881
- False. - Correct.

669
00:45:55.652 --> 00:45:57.192
Be careful.

670
00:45:57.292 --> 00:45:59.051
What are you doing?

671
00:46:00.252 --> 00:46:03.522
Block her vision. Don't let her see.

672
00:46:03.832 --> 00:46:05.031
Block her.

673
00:46:18.372 --> 00:46:21.381
(Kitchen toys)

674
00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:26.582
(Beat the Senior Writer Jang Ha Ri)

675
00:46:27.721 --> 00:46:28.922
No one's here yet.

676
00:46:37.292 --> 00:46:38.392
Ready?

677
00:46:38.661 --> 00:46:40.361
Here.

678
00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:42.562
Seriously.

679
00:46:43.131 --> 00:46:44.272
You don't want to wear it?

680
00:46:44.732 --> 00:46:46.701
Why not? Why don't you want to wear it?

681
00:46:47.071 --> 00:46:48.902
You need to wear it to look pretty.

682
00:46:48.902 --> 00:46:50.741
Daddy thinks this makes you look pretty.

683
00:46:50.911 --> 00:46:53.712
I guess you're very confident in your looks.

684
00:46:53.712 --> 00:46:54.841
Hold on.

685
00:46:55.511 --> 00:46:56.841
Let's call the fixer.

686
00:46:57.152 --> 00:46:58.352
What is she doing?

687
00:47:05.422 --> 00:47:06.522
Please.

688
00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:10.022
(Can't take Do Ah's pictures. Come after work, please.)

689
00:47:10.122 --> 00:47:11.661
(Jang Ha Ri)

690
00:47:13.062 --> 00:47:14.502
- You came. - You came.

691
00:47:15.102 --> 00:47:16.861
- Hello. - Hello.

692
00:47:19.772 --> 00:47:20.872
Please have a seat.

693
00:47:22.602 --> 00:47:25.971
The subject is infant care. The highest difficulty.

694
00:47:26.942 --> 00:47:28.042
Do you see this?

695
00:47:28.042 --> 00:47:30.482
You can just take these prizes pretty much for free.

696
00:47:30.911 --> 00:47:33.922
Okay. "Beat Jang Ha Ri".

697
00:47:34.082 --> 00:47:35.352
- Let's begin! - Let's do this!

698
00:47:35.352 --> 00:47:36.482
Good luck!

699
00:47:36.681 --> 00:47:37.821
Good luck.

700
00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:40.622
Okay. First question.

701
00:47:40.922 --> 00:47:41.991
Give me the card.

702
00:47:43.022 --> 00:47:46.232
- Which brand makes this bottle? - Me.

703
00:47:46.361 --> 00:47:48.361
- What do you mean, "me"? - The Mom.

704
00:47:48.361 --> 00:47:49.931
- The Mom. - Mommy Fatty Baby Bottle.

705
00:47:49.931 --> 00:47:51.272
- Fatty! Correct! - Yes!

706
00:47:53.332 --> 00:47:54.402
Give me the prize.

707
00:47:54.902 --> 00:47:56.772
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

708
00:47:57.411 --> 00:47:59.011
Congratulations.

709
00:47:59.341 --> 00:48:02.011
The next question is a music question.

710
00:48:02.042 --> 00:48:04.881
Listen carefully and guess the title.

711
00:48:05.011 --> 00:48:06.181
Play it, please.

712
00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:10.451
- Jang Ha Ri! Pororo! - Pororo! Which year?

713
00:48:10.522 --> 00:48:11.652
Which year?

714
00:48:11.951 --> 00:48:13.721
The Mom. Year two.

715
00:48:13.721 --> 00:48:15.062
Year two! Correct!

716
00:48:17.591 --> 00:48:19.761
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

717
00:48:19.761 --> 00:48:20.861
Congratulations.

718
00:48:21.201 --> 00:48:23.872
Next The Mom member, please come up.

719
00:48:25.471 --> 00:48:27.971
These are two identical-looking porridge.

720
00:48:28.272 --> 00:48:30.942
Which is early and which is mid-stage?

721
00:48:30.942 --> 00:48:32.442
- Jang Ha Ri. Early. Mid-stage. - Correct!

722
00:48:41.551 --> 00:48:44.152
How many months old is this baby?

723
00:48:46.622 --> 00:48:49.392
- Jang Ha Ri. 12 months. - 12 months! Correct!

724
00:48:57.672 --> 00:48:59.431
Look here.

725
00:48:59.801 --> 00:49:01.801
You're tired, right? We're almost done.

726
00:49:02.042 --> 00:49:04.241
My pretty little daughter.

727
00:49:04.511 --> 00:49:06.872
What? You miss Auntie Ha Ri?

728
00:49:06.942 --> 00:49:09.212
Daddy misses Auntie Ha Ri too.

729
00:49:16.352 --> 00:49:18.551
What's that? Auntie Ha Ri must be here.

730
00:49:32.232 --> 00:49:33.402
May I help you?

731
00:49:33.832 --> 00:49:37.241
I'm Yoon Do Ah's mom.

732
00:49:48.582 --> 00:49:50.652
Yes. Good job.

733
00:49:52.091 --> 00:49:53.422
Will you become a soccer player?

734
00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:55.462
Why don't you join them?

735
00:49:57.562 --> 00:50:00.131
(First Birthday)

736
00:50:06.701 --> 00:50:08.571
Let's take a family picture.

737
00:50:09.142 --> 00:50:10.341
Did Ha Ri tell you?

738
00:50:11.142 --> 00:50:12.642
She called me at the hospital.

739
00:50:13.142 --> 00:50:15.312
She didn't say anything else and just gave me the address.

740
00:50:16.042 --> 00:50:17.352
Just take this picture, but nothing else.

741
00:50:17.611 --> 00:50:19.352
I don't want Do Ah to get hurt.

742
00:50:21.082 --> 00:50:23.181
Excuse me. There.

743
00:50:29.892 --> 00:50:31.491
Here we go.

744
00:50:32.091 --> 00:50:34.261
1, 2, 3.

745
00:50:41.142 --> 00:50:42.442
Did you have fun?

746
00:50:42.701 --> 00:50:43.872
Yes.

747
00:50:44.772 --> 00:50:47.982
If you write about infant care for 15 years, you can tell...

748
00:50:48.312 --> 00:50:50.341
how many months a baby is just from a picture.

749
00:50:52.451 --> 00:50:54.752
I challenged you moms although I have...

750
00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:57.622
no experience in raising a baby...

751
00:50:59.152 --> 00:51:03.161
because I wanted to show you what we lack...

752
00:51:03.562 --> 00:51:05.361
and what we're good at.

753
00:51:05.991 --> 00:51:07.832
Our job is to guide people...

754
00:51:08.502 --> 00:51:11.701
and help them ease their way through childcare...

755
00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:13.902
like a reference book and a close friend...

756
00:51:13.902 --> 00:51:15.602
although there are no right or wrong answers to it.

757
00:51:17.071 --> 00:51:20.111
You're the woman who tried to buy sperm, aren't you?

758
00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:23.181
How could you try to do something like that?

759
00:51:27.951 --> 00:51:30.951
You might think I don't deserve to work at a baby magazine...

760
00:51:30.951 --> 00:51:33.951
because of my personal life.

761
00:51:34.821 --> 00:51:38.531
But I'm grateful that you got angry at me as a mother.

762
00:51:38.732 --> 00:51:41.431
And after you read my column,

763
00:51:42.732 --> 00:51:44.502
you also understood...

764
00:51:44.931 --> 00:51:46.931
how much I wanted to become a mom.

765
00:51:47.801 --> 00:51:49.741
And that makes me want to become a better journalist...

766
00:51:50.502 --> 00:51:52.712
and a confident mother.

767
00:51:55.111 --> 00:51:57.611
For the past 15 years, I met so many different mothers.

768
00:51:58.881 --> 00:52:00.011
And that made me...

769
00:52:00.881 --> 00:52:02.821
want to become a mother even more.

770
00:52:05.622 --> 00:52:08.892
I'll keep learning and share more information with you.

771
00:52:10.321 --> 00:52:13.562
So I hope you subscribe to our magazine again.

772
00:52:15.861 --> 00:52:17.261
Please.

773
00:52:17.531 --> 00:52:19.071
Please.

774
00:52:32.312 --> 00:52:34.451
Gosh, where is it?

775
00:52:36.951 --> 00:52:38.152
Where could it be?

776
00:52:41.192 --> 00:52:42.321
It's not this.

777
00:52:50.201 --> 00:52:51.502
Oh, my gosh!

778
00:52:58.442 --> 00:52:59.772
It's me!

779
00:52:59.772 --> 00:53:02.011
It's me, Eu Ddeum! It's me!

780
00:53:02.312 --> 00:53:03.381
It's Eu Ddeum.

781
00:53:05.551 --> 00:53:07.082
Why were you staring behind the shelf?

782
00:53:07.082 --> 00:53:08.582
I thought you were a thief.

783
00:53:09.051 --> 00:53:10.582
Sorry for startling you.

784
00:53:13.321 --> 00:53:16.062
What... What did I hit you with? A snack?

785
00:53:16.192 --> 00:53:17.462
A watermelon?

786
00:53:18.562 --> 00:53:20.091
Did I throw something at your face?

787
00:53:20.431 --> 00:53:23.062
No, it didn't hurt at all. Are you okay?

788
00:53:24.102 --> 00:53:25.332
My gosh.

789
00:53:26.732 --> 00:53:28.542
Why do you keep making me hit you?

790
00:53:29.341 --> 00:53:31.812
Gosh, I shouldn't hit you even if you do something bad.

791
00:53:32.542 --> 00:53:35.341
I'm sorry. From now on, I'll only do things that are worth complimenting.

792
00:53:35.841 --> 00:53:36.942
Sorry.

793
00:53:38.352 --> 00:53:39.852
My goodness.

794
00:53:40.752 --> 00:53:43.681
There's something weird about you.

795
00:53:44.022 --> 00:53:46.922
You never do anything right, but it's hard to hate you.

796
00:53:47.591 --> 00:53:50.062
My gosh, seriously.

797
00:53:51.292 --> 00:53:55.062
Then if I only do the right things, does that mean you'll like me?

798
00:53:59.902 --> 00:54:02.502
Ms. Jang, can you give me your hand?

799
00:54:02.571 --> 00:54:05.542
I once had someone read my palm.

800
00:54:06.611 --> 00:54:08.942
But your palm...

801
00:54:11.951 --> 00:54:14.252
My gosh, what is that?

802
00:54:15.652 --> 00:54:16.652
Gosh.

803
00:54:17.082 --> 00:54:19.922
What are you doing? What's with the scissors?

804
00:54:20.821 --> 00:54:22.922
I just got curious.

805
00:54:22.922 --> 00:54:25.392
People sometimes do things for no reason.

806
00:54:25.392 --> 00:54:27.701
I just did it for no reason.

807
00:54:27.962 --> 00:54:29.062
All of a sudden?

808
00:54:30.332 --> 00:54:31.571
Take it away.

809
00:54:41.642 --> 00:54:44.551
Who is this for?

810
00:54:44.582 --> 00:54:47.681
Just a second. It's personal. Let me try this on you.

811
00:54:48.652 --> 00:54:49.721
Just a moment.

812
00:54:50.022 --> 00:54:52.352
Are you going to try this with all the scissors?

813
00:54:53.422 --> 00:54:55.962
This is the last one. I promise I'll stop after this.

814
00:55:03.661 --> 00:55:04.732
My gosh.

815
00:55:13.142 --> 00:55:15.042
You're really weird.

816
00:55:18.611 --> 00:55:20.212
I thought about...

817
00:55:20.212 --> 00:55:22.522
how I would've felt if someone else...

818
00:55:22.881 --> 00:55:24.392
asked for what you wanted.

819
00:55:26.022 --> 00:55:27.522
But it just felt wrong.

820
00:55:28.261 --> 00:55:29.692
I think...

821
00:55:32.131 --> 00:55:35.131
I wanted to share it with you because it's you.

822
00:55:40.701 --> 00:55:41.841
But...

823
00:55:45.071 --> 00:55:46.511
I don't think I can give it to you anymore.

824
00:56:10.402 --> 00:56:12.031
It's open. Come in.

825
00:56:18.071 --> 00:56:20.172
It's you? I thought it was Eun Young.

826
00:56:20.611 --> 00:56:21.812
Why would you get involved?

827
00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:23.812
Why would you call Jeong Won?

828
00:56:30.721 --> 00:56:32.591
I just thought about Do Ah.

829
00:56:33.522 --> 00:56:35.922
I didn't want her to think that her mom abandoned her...

830
00:56:35.922 --> 00:56:39.431
every time she saw the photos from her first birthday.

831
00:56:42.462 --> 00:56:44.872
Do you hate Jeong Won that much?

832
00:56:45.372 --> 00:56:46.971
No, I hate you more.

833
00:56:47.301 --> 00:56:48.642
My gosh.

834
00:56:48.971 --> 00:56:51.971
Why are you so cranky? You're about to turn 40 soon.

835
00:56:52.712 --> 00:56:54.111
Don't be such a kid.

836
00:56:54.611 --> 00:56:55.942
Ha Ri.

837
00:56:57.681 --> 00:56:59.652
What? What do you want?

838
00:57:00.252 --> 00:57:03.622
Hey, do you think you can intimidate me by doing this?

839
00:57:05.451 --> 00:57:07.892
Do you really want me to get back together with Jeong Won?

840
00:57:09.821 --> 00:57:11.531
That's up to you guys to decide.

841
00:57:12.761 --> 00:57:13.931
Well, I don't feel that way.

842
00:57:14.261 --> 00:57:17.131
I don't like that you're dating Han I Sang.

843
00:57:21.841 --> 00:57:23.372
Why is the door open?

844
00:57:25.341 --> 00:57:27.672
What are you guys doing? Are you fighting again?

845
00:57:27.672 --> 00:57:29.281
No, we're not fighting.

846
00:57:31.111 --> 00:57:32.511
My gosh.

847
00:57:33.181 --> 00:57:34.781
Seriously.

848
00:57:35.082 --> 00:57:37.022
You guys need to stop fighting.

849
00:57:40.922 --> 00:57:42.892
Gosh, what happened?

850
00:57:44.562 --> 00:57:48.031
I was just a little angry. I hope you understand.

851
00:57:49.931 --> 00:57:51.732
Okay, fine.

852
00:57:51.902 --> 00:57:53.602
I'm sorry.

853
00:57:56.341 --> 00:57:58.712
You know how I caught my brother-in-law cheating...

854
00:57:58.712 --> 00:58:01.181
and told everything to my sister?

855
00:58:01.712 --> 00:58:04.511
- But my sister is angry at me. - Why?

856
00:58:05.812 --> 00:58:08.982
She apparently knew about it but pretended not to know.

857
00:58:08.982 --> 00:58:11.551
But now that I caught him, she can no longer ignore it.

858
00:58:11.551 --> 00:58:13.192
You have no idea how much she cried.

859
00:58:14.122 --> 00:58:16.922
My sister can't live without my brother-in-law.

860
00:58:17.622 --> 00:58:20.062
They can't get a divorce because of the kids.

861
00:58:20.832 --> 00:58:23.931
When you have kids together, your relationship never ends...

862
00:58:24.002 --> 00:58:26.431
even after you get a divorce.

863
00:58:31.642 --> 00:58:34.372
I get that you're angry for having met your ex-wife.

864
00:58:35.241 --> 00:58:38.451
But I'm just really happy that I'm dating someone in 10 years.

865
00:58:38.582 --> 00:58:40.652
Just cut me some slack.

866
00:58:41.551 --> 00:58:43.221
It's none of his business anyway.

867
00:58:44.852 --> 00:58:47.252
I'm so proud of you, Ha Ri.

868
00:58:47.551 --> 00:58:50.991
I thought you'd grow old all by yourself.

869
00:58:51.491 --> 00:58:54.332
Don't think about having kids. Just date him. Don't even marry him.

870
00:58:55.902 --> 00:58:57.661
I can't wait to see...

871
00:58:57.931 --> 00:58:59.772
how handsome he is.

872
00:58:59.772 --> 00:59:02.002
You'll get shocked once you see him.

873
00:59:02.741 --> 00:59:04.672
Talking about him makes me miss him so much.

874
00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:07.042
Don't go overboard.

875
00:59:07.942 --> 00:59:10.812
Don't end up pouring your heart out only to end up in tears.

876
00:59:11.152 --> 00:59:12.451
Don't go overboard with your feelings.

877
00:59:15.422 --> 00:59:17.752
Who in the world loves that way?

878
00:59:18.292 --> 00:59:22.091
Am I supposed to measure how much affection I'm supposed to give him?

879
00:59:26.631 --> 00:59:28.562
Why do you think we'll break up?

880
00:59:30.562 --> 00:59:32.402
Because that's what you always do.

881
00:59:33.002 --> 00:59:36.741
You get hurt and become single, then you get hurt and become single.

882
00:59:41.881 --> 00:59:45.252
You're a real jerk. You annoying little punk.

883
01:00:03.431 --> 01:00:04.431
See you.

884
01:00:08.341 --> 01:00:09.402
Jae Young.

885
01:00:11.872 --> 01:00:13.142
Do you want to end your friendship?

886
01:00:13.672 --> 01:00:15.281
- What? - It's too late...

887
01:00:15.281 --> 01:00:17.511
to look at her like that.

888
01:00:20.982 --> 01:00:22.681
Ha Ri won't see you again...

889
01:00:22.721 --> 01:00:24.152
if she knows what you're up to.

890
01:00:24.951 --> 01:00:26.622
What did I even do?

891
01:00:27.692 --> 01:00:30.062
You won't even let me look at her.

892
01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:33.261
So what else can I do?

893
01:00:36.861 --> 01:00:38.172
You like her that much?

894
01:00:42.002 --> 01:00:45.011
Look at how happy she is to finally date someone in 10 years.

895
01:00:45.312 --> 01:00:46.841
She won't even consider you.

896
01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:49.212
You might just end up losing a good friend.

897
01:00:54.212 --> 01:00:55.721
Come here, Do Ah.

898
01:00:55.721 --> 01:00:57.082
- How adorable. - What's this, Do Ah?

899
01:00:57.082 --> 01:00:58.522
Do Ah, do you know what this is?

900
01:00:58.522 --> 01:01:00.551
- My goodness. - Look.

901
01:01:01.122 --> 01:01:02.821
Here. Watch this.

902
01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:08.701
At least she knew what to get her daughter.

903
01:01:08.701 --> 01:01:09.832
Goodness.

904
01:01:10.131 --> 01:01:13.031
Isn't this fascinating? My gosh.

905
01:01:13.332 --> 01:01:14.902
Can you walk a bit more?

906
01:01:15.402 --> 01:01:17.241
Even if it doesn't work out with him,

907
01:01:18.312 --> 01:01:19.642
she won't choose you.

908
01:01:20.571 --> 01:01:24.312
If you wish to stay by her side, quietly make your feelings go away.

909
01:01:25.051 --> 01:01:26.951
- Do Ah, look at this. - Gosh.

910
01:01:27.011 --> 01:01:29.622
Over here. Look!

911
01:01:42.361 --> 01:01:43.602
My gosh.

912
01:01:45.232 --> 01:01:47.201
I'm going to call him...

913
01:01:47.201 --> 01:01:48.301
(Han I Sang)

914
01:01:51.102 --> 01:01:53.542
- Hello? - Talk about nice timing.

915
01:01:53.542 --> 01:01:55.312
Did you know that I'd been thinking of you?

916
01:01:57.011 --> 01:01:59.181
Didn't you know that I missed you more?

917
01:02:01.111 --> 01:02:03.721
So who won? You or the moms?

918
01:02:04.181 --> 01:02:05.852
I took quite the beating...

919
01:02:05.852 --> 01:02:07.022
and my head nearly fell off.

920
01:02:07.752 --> 01:02:11.732
My gosh. If only I had been there to provide comfort.

921
01:02:12.031 --> 01:02:13.292
So where should we go next?

922
01:02:13.761 --> 01:02:15.962
How about the tteokbokki place near my house?

923
01:02:16.031 --> 01:02:17.232
It's delicious, you know.

924
01:02:47.232 --> 01:02:48.602
Are you sure about this?

925
01:02:49.562 --> 01:02:52.201
Emotionally, you had a tough time before.

926
01:02:52.772 --> 01:02:55.741
I feel like I can endure it this time around.

927
01:02:57.142 --> 01:02:59.611
You must receive hormone injections...

928
01:02:59.611 --> 01:03:01.381
twice a week for at least three months.

929
01:03:01.642 --> 01:03:05.181
But since you don't have the time to come by every week,

930
01:03:05.312 --> 01:03:07.352
I'll instruct you of how to give the shots yourself.

931
01:03:07.911 --> 01:03:11.181
I'm sure you're aware that the result might not be desirable.

932
01:03:14.292 --> 01:03:17.062
If it doesn't work, I'll try another three months.

933
01:03:17.462 --> 01:03:18.732
A year if I need to.

934
01:03:19.692 --> 01:03:20.931
I'll try until it works.

935
01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:23.701
Did you tell your girlfriend?

936
01:03:28.301 --> 01:03:29.502
I should've.

937
01:03:33.272 --> 01:03:35.281
This time, I should.

939
01:03:52.192 --> 01:03:53.732
Please.

940
01:03:53.832 --> 01:03:54.931
All right.

941
01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:57.232

944
01:04:02.272 --> 01:04:03.372
- Nice! - She's here.

945
01:04:04.402 --> 01:04:07.042
See? What did I tell you?

946
01:04:07.741 --> 01:04:08.942
This is a sign of hope.

(Dori entered the chatroom.)

949
01:04:13.252 --> 01:04:15.982
- That's another one. - Yes!

950
01:04:16.781 --> 01:04:18.422
I knew it.

951
01:04:18.622 --> 01:04:20.091
What did I tell you?

952
01:04:20.752 --> 01:04:23.161
(Ji Yeon's mom entered the room.)

953
01:04:24.591 --> 01:04:26.261
(Invitation accepted, 30 out of 30)

954
01:04:27.431 --> 01:04:29.701
- We did it. - Nice!

955
01:04:36.502 --> 01:04:37.741
Good job, Ha Ri.

956
01:04:38.672 --> 01:04:39.772
Hello, sir.

957
01:04:40.741 --> 01:04:43.911
Did you see the chatroom? All the moms are back.

958
01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:45.482
Is that so?

959
01:04:46.781 --> 01:04:48.252
I saw the video you took.

960
01:04:48.622 --> 01:04:51.892
The chairman saw it too and he wishes to speak to you.

961
01:04:52.821 --> 01:04:54.252
Did he say anything else?

962
01:04:54.652 --> 01:04:55.792
You'll know once you see him.

963
01:04:56.991 --> 01:05:00.332
The decision will be finalized if there aren't any further issues.

964
01:05:09.142 --> 01:05:11.442
Good job, Manager Jang.

965
01:05:15.781 --> 01:05:18.011
- Manager Jang. - Manager Jang!

966
01:05:20.551 --> 01:05:23.181
- Yes! - I knew it.

967
01:05:23.451 --> 01:05:25.321
Let's wrap up for the day and head home.

968
01:05:25.491 --> 01:05:27.721
Thanks, guys. I couldn't have done it without you.

969
01:05:29.491 --> 01:05:30.622
My gosh.

970
01:05:31.091 --> 01:05:32.392
Let's get going then.

971
01:05:32.392 --> 01:05:33.792
- Come on. - Bye, guys.

972
01:05:33.792 --> 01:05:35.661
Let's get out of here.

973
01:05:35.761 --> 01:05:38.372
- Let's go! - Come on.

(Go, Jang Ha Ri!)

976
01:06:52.142 --> 01:06:54.642
(Ha Ri)

977
01:06:55.782 --> 01:06:57.612
- Hello? - Where are you?

978
01:07:00.551 --> 01:07:02.251
Over here.

979
01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:18.261
You have no idea how good I'm feeling today.

980
01:07:19.532 --> 01:07:21.032
I felt so good...

981
01:07:22.041 --> 01:07:23.801
that I kept wanting to see you...

982
01:07:24.971 --> 01:07:26.211
and missed you even more.

983
01:07:28.171 --> 01:07:29.242
It's why...

984
01:07:30.681 --> 01:07:33.112
I must tell you this today.

985
01:07:37.282 --> 01:07:38.352
I love you.

986
01:07:46.091 --> 01:07:47.232
I...

987
01:07:48.232 --> 01:07:49.461
love you too.

988
01:07:54.131 --> 01:07:55.242
Ms. Jang.

989
01:08:21.662 --> 01:08:23.001
Ha Ri didn't come home last night.

990
01:08:23.402 --> 01:08:25.072
Do you know where she went?

991
01:08:25.931 --> 01:08:28.272
Are you worried that she'd end up not having kids?

992
01:08:29.142 --> 01:08:30.902
I'm worried that she'll end up living alone.

993
01:08:32.841 --> 01:08:36.581
Are you okay with her raising a child...

994
01:08:36.581 --> 01:08:37.711
on her own?

995
01:08:38.551 --> 01:08:41.551
No mother wants her child to be a single mother.

996
01:08:41.852 --> 01:08:45.091
Of course, I wish for her to get married to someone.

997
01:08:45.692 --> 01:08:49.192
I only approved of the pregnancy because her clock's ticking.

998
01:08:50.662 --> 01:08:54.291
Auntie, what if I lived with her?

999
01:08:57.431 --> 01:08:58.532
You?

1000
01:09:00.801 --> 01:09:04.102
I just have to be with her like I am right now.

1001
01:09:10.211 --> 01:09:11.412
Just like...

1002
01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:13.581
how I've been.

1003
01:09:39.772 --> 01:09:42.612
(Oh My Baby)

1004
01:09:42.841 --> 01:09:46.681
I'd love nothing more than to take you home with me right now.

1005
01:09:47.381 --> 01:09:48.681
What do you say?

1006
01:09:49.022 --> 01:09:51.221
Could you perhaps change the lights for me?

1007
01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:52.692
What lights?

1008
01:09:52.692 --> 01:09:54.952
Which lights are you talking about?

1009
01:09:54.952 --> 01:09:56.091
Are you free on Saturday?

1010
01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:57.522
You must make time for me that day.

1011
01:09:57.522 --> 01:09:59.461
I'm here to buy the C brand ring.

1012
01:09:59.662 --> 01:10:01.492
We're dating.

1013
01:10:01.761 --> 01:10:03.631
If I hadn't married Jeong Won,

1014
01:10:03.631 --> 01:10:05.871
what would've happened to us?

1015
01:10:05.931 --> 01:10:07.471
Do you have feelings for Ha Ri?

1016
01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:11.742
Yes, and I don't know what to do.
