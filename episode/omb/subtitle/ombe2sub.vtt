00:00:40.463 --> 00:00:42.363
(Dahan Hospital OB-GYN)

2
00:00:42.955 --> 00:00:44.256
Excuse me, sir.

3
00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:46.525
The patient left this behind.

4
00:00:47.955 --> 00:00:49.195
She left? All by herself?

5
00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:50.595
Yes.

6
00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:03.346
Gosh.

7
00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:07.816
A seven-percent probability to get naturally pregnant...

8
00:01:07.816 --> 00:01:09.916
doesn't mean it's entirely impossible to have a baby.

9
00:01:10.316 --> 00:01:12.886
But your fecundity will continue to decrease.

10
00:01:13.185 --> 00:01:14.825
If you plan to get pregnant any time soon,

11
00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:16.655
you can postpone the endometriosis surgery.

12
00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:19.496
What would you like to do?

13
00:01:19.696 --> 00:01:22.596
Do you want to get the surgery or get ready for pregnancy?

14
00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:30.905
Then let's do a follow-up in six months.

15
00:01:31.206 --> 00:01:33.376
If you still haven't gotten better, let's do the surgery then.

16
00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:37.405
"Six months"?

17
00:01:45.456 --> 00:01:46.585
Ms. Jang.

18
00:01:47.285 --> 00:01:48.356
What are you doing here?

19
00:01:48.926 --> 00:01:52.055
I'm... I'm looking for a pharmacy.

20
00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:53.695
A pharmacy...

21
00:01:56.895 --> 00:01:58.266
Do you not feel well?

22
00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:00.165
No, I...

23
00:02:01.365 --> 00:02:03.005
Why does it feel like it's all over?

24
00:02:04.206 --> 00:02:06.135
This can't be the end.

25
00:02:12.745 --> 00:02:13.975
Do you want to marry me?

26
00:02:29.995 --> 00:02:32.995
It looks like something happened.

27
00:02:32.995 --> 00:02:34.066
So I won't ask.

28
00:02:42.706 --> 00:02:43.775
What?

29
00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:52.815
I don't get what you're talking about.

30
00:02:53.386 --> 00:02:56.025
I'm not interested in getting married.

31
00:02:57.555 --> 00:02:59.696
- With whom? - With you.

32
00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:02.696
Why would you marry me?

33
00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:06.865
Do you want to marry me?

34
00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:15.145
It was my way of thanking you.

35
00:03:15.976 --> 00:03:18.145
I felt grateful enough to even propose to you.

36
00:03:18.345 --> 00:03:22.516
Just consider it as a polite way of saying thanks.

37
00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:24.745
You get that, right?

38
00:03:25.815 --> 00:03:27.815
No, not really.

39
00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:29.655
I see.

40
00:03:30.555 --> 00:03:31.696
You don't get it.

41
00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:34.995
I guess I should've gone with the common route then.

42
00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:36.625
Anyway, I'm grateful.

43
00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:37.726
I'd even be more grateful...

44
00:03:37.726 --> 00:03:40.036
if you could forget about everything that just happened as well.

45
00:03:40.236 --> 00:03:41.236
But...

46
00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:44.736
You don't seem to be thinking clearly.

47
00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:45.775
Can I give you a lift?

48
00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:49.046
No, I'm good. I'm back to normal, so you can go.

49
00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:52.016
- Ms. Jang... - I'm fine, so...

50
00:04:02.685 --> 00:04:05.625
You're a polite one, aren't you?

51
00:04:16.405 --> 00:04:17.565
That's enough.

52
00:04:17.835 --> 00:04:20.506
Get back down here and let me do it.

53
00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:22.076
Unbelievable.

54
00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:26.476
I know how to replace a light bulb, you know.

55
00:04:26.576 --> 00:04:28.345
Why would I let you have the pleasure?

56
00:04:28.486 --> 00:04:29.845
Go back to watching the baby.

57
00:04:29.845 --> 00:04:31.916
I find you cool either way,

58
00:04:31.986 --> 00:04:33.756
so let me do the grunt work around here.

59
00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:36.055
That's not why I asked you to come live with us.

60
00:04:36.625 --> 00:04:39.226
The women in this family managed without a man for over 30 years.

61
00:04:39.296 --> 00:04:40.525
Don't even think about being our handyman.

62
00:04:40.995 --> 00:04:43.226
How can I not when I'm the only guy...

63
00:04:43.226 --> 00:04:44.696
around the house?

64
00:04:44.995 --> 00:04:46.136
The cutlery is what you'll grab.

65
00:04:46.136 --> 00:04:47.835
That's how it is at your mother-in-law's.

66
00:04:49.766 --> 00:04:50.865
My mother-in-law?

67
00:04:52.305 --> 00:04:54.836
I'm just saying we're as close as that.

68
00:04:56.375 --> 00:04:58.315
And have Ha Ri help raise Do Ah.

69
00:04:58.315 --> 00:04:59.716
She'll do a good job.

70
00:05:00.945 --> 00:05:02.586
Why would I ask her that?

71
00:05:04.716 --> 00:05:05.856
As a stepmother...

72
00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:07.916
"A stepmother"?

73
00:05:09.426 --> 00:05:12.325
- We're a family again, aren't we? - Right.

74
00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:15.865
Anyway, she just adores kids.

75
00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:18.396
She's great at babysitting them too.

76
00:05:20.135 --> 00:05:23.005
I know that, but why would I...

77
00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:26.005
Here. Drink this.

78
00:05:26.005 --> 00:05:29.075
Gosh, thank you. You didn't have to.

79
00:05:29.776 --> 00:05:31.276
You need to go back to how you were.

80
00:05:32.015 --> 00:05:33.375
It's herbal medicine.

81
00:05:34.115 --> 00:05:38.216
You should've lived a good life, not come back as a scruffy dog.

82
00:06:23.026 --> 00:06:24.695
Mom!

83
00:06:47.755 --> 00:06:49.356
- Say goodbye. - Bye!

84
00:06:49.685 --> 00:06:50.755
Really?

85
00:07:00.896 --> 00:07:02.935
(My mom Ms. Ok Ran)

86
00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:08.705
Yes, Mom?

87
00:07:09.005 --> 00:07:10.646
Are you busy?

88
00:07:13.245 --> 00:07:14.315
Not really.

89
00:07:14.646 --> 00:07:17.245
Can you make it to Eun Joo's wedding this weekend?

90
00:07:19.885 --> 00:07:20.955
I have a deadline to meet.

91
00:07:21.286 --> 00:07:22.786
You'll be done by then.

92
00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:26.026
Swing by if you can. Your aunt will be devastated.

93
00:07:27.796 --> 00:07:28.896
I'll see what I can do.

94
00:07:29.596 --> 00:07:31.125
You'll do what?

95
00:07:31.325 --> 00:07:33.896
Did you know that you always use your deadline as an excuse?

96
00:07:34.466 --> 00:07:35.536
Even your aunt knows that...

97
00:07:35.536 --> 00:07:37.966
you're deliberately skipping weddings and kids' birthday parties.

98
00:07:39.176 --> 00:07:40.176
It serves you right for letting...

99
00:07:40.176 --> 00:07:41.375
your younger cousins get married first.

100
00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:47.976
Missing family events like this only make them pity you more.

101
00:07:47.976 --> 00:07:51.586
You should attend them with your head held up high.

102
00:07:52.356 --> 00:07:53.455
- I... - Got it?

103
00:07:53.885 --> 00:07:55.356
I didn't commit a crime, you know.

104
00:07:55.856 --> 00:07:57.726
Why do you think I'd feel ashamed?

105
00:07:58.026 --> 00:08:01.596
Can I only hold my head up high if I'm married with kids?

106
00:08:04.096 --> 00:08:05.365
Okay, fine.

107
00:08:08.396 --> 00:08:09.736
Mom, I...

108
00:08:13.135 --> 00:08:14.205
What was that?

109
00:08:16.575 --> 00:08:18.276
I'll have dinner ready, so don't be late.

110
00:08:19.015 --> 00:08:20.075
Whatever. I'm hanging up.

111
00:08:50.776 --> 00:08:52.476
Ha Ri!

112
00:08:52.875 --> 00:08:53.976
What took you so long?

113
00:08:53.976 --> 00:08:56.586
Ms. Shim is shooting lasers out of her eyes.

114
00:09:01.086 --> 00:09:03.026
Right, of course.

115
00:09:05.856 --> 00:09:06.926
Sure.

116
00:09:08.426 --> 00:09:10.225
Ms. Shim, you're back.

117
00:09:10.695 --> 00:09:12.335
I thought you had another week off.

118
00:09:12.335 --> 00:09:14.195
How can I stay home when this is happening?

119
00:09:14.366 --> 00:09:16.136
But the issue was solved.

120
00:09:16.366 --> 00:09:19.906
Leave the Advertising Department to solve their own problems.

121
00:09:20.075 --> 00:09:22.075
Why did you agree to wear the fake pregnant belly?

122
00:09:22.445 --> 00:09:24.075
Still, it led to a deal.

123
00:09:24.146 --> 00:09:25.546
Then take care of the Eggo photo shoot too.

124
00:09:26.975 --> 00:09:28.075
Sorry?

125
00:09:28.075 --> 00:09:30.016
Eggo said they wouldn't be renewing their contract,

126
00:09:30.016 --> 00:09:32.315
so it's up to you to get them to sign with us again.

127
00:09:32.516 --> 00:09:33.685
Send Ha Ri the related materials.

128
00:09:33.855 --> 00:09:37.355
What? But I worked hard casting Na Eun as the model for this.

129
00:09:37.855 --> 00:09:39.555
Why would that fall on my lap?

130
00:09:41.325 --> 00:09:43.126
Why do you keep throwing projects at me?

131
00:09:43.126 --> 00:09:44.266
I'm not in the Advertising Department...

132
00:09:44.266 --> 00:09:46.465
If you want to patronize...

133
00:09:46.465 --> 00:09:49.435
and order subordinates around, be the editor-in-chief yourself.

134
00:09:49.805 --> 00:09:51.366
I didn't cut my baby's breastfeeding short...

135
00:09:51.366 --> 00:09:52.705
just to hear you talk back at me!

136
00:10:03.286 --> 00:10:06.416
I'll call it a day for now and get begging tomorrow.

137
00:10:16.026 --> 00:10:17.095
Back to work, guys.

138
00:10:28.746 --> 00:10:31.046
Gyeong Jin's getting married next month.

139
00:10:31.345 --> 00:10:33.016
Tell me about it.

140
00:10:33.276 --> 00:10:35.215
Everyone's finally getting married one by one.

141
00:10:35.786 --> 00:10:36.845
Myeong Sook's son...

142
00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:38.815
- got into Sehan University. - I know.

143
00:10:39.185 --> 00:10:40.215
Is your daughter...

144
00:10:40.215 --> 00:10:42.325
- a high school senior this year? - That's right.

145
00:10:42.756 --> 00:10:45.695
- Gosh, time sure flies. - Tell me about it.

146
00:10:49.296 --> 00:10:53.866
(Episode 2: Am I on the Right Path?)

147
00:11:06.345 --> 00:11:09.246
Is she asleep? Why are all the lights off?

148
00:11:09.246 --> 00:11:10.945
Gosh.

149
00:11:11.985 --> 00:11:14.355
What on earth?

150
00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:17.685
What are you up to?

151
00:11:20.095 --> 00:11:22.565
You just can't be normal, can you?

152
00:11:22.666 --> 00:11:24.626
Unbelievable. Here you go.

153
00:11:26.136 --> 00:11:27.195
It's for you.

154
00:11:27.496 --> 00:11:28.835
Your cousin's getting married.

155
00:11:30.006 --> 00:11:31.965
It seems to be easy for everyone else.

156
00:11:32.876 --> 00:11:36.046
That must be why you seem a little depressed.

157
00:11:37.075 --> 00:11:38.146
Not really.

158
00:11:38.845 --> 00:11:42.315
In my 20s, I thought marriage would happen to me naturally.

159
00:11:42.646 --> 00:11:44.485
When I reached my 30s though, it became a test.

160
00:11:44.646 --> 00:11:46.516
I needed to study about men, how to date them,

161
00:11:46.955 --> 00:11:48.616
and go on blind dates that felt like interviews.

162
00:11:49.886 --> 00:11:52.055
I'm about to turn 40 now,

163
00:11:53.026 --> 00:11:55.825
and I learned that my efforts won't take me down the aisle.

164
00:11:57.426 --> 00:11:58.965
What do I do?

165
00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:01.835
What else? You can just give up.

166
00:12:01.896 --> 00:12:04.866
If life happens as we want it to, no one would have a crappy life.

167
00:12:04.866 --> 00:12:06.136
I might be in a different place...

168
00:12:06.136 --> 00:12:08.006
if I had put in a little more effort though.

169
00:12:09.475 --> 00:12:10.676
Well...

170
00:12:12.575 --> 00:12:14.575
Anyway, I'm regretting my yesterdays...

171
00:12:14.575 --> 00:12:16.815
and hoping that I don't lose my chance tomorrow.

172
00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:18.715
Your life isn't so bad...

173
00:12:20.355 --> 00:12:21.786
Forget it.

174
00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:24.725
So what's up with your belly?

175
00:12:24.825 --> 00:12:26.996
Gosh, get that out of there.

176
00:12:28.996 --> 00:12:30.095
Let it be.

177
00:12:31.426 --> 00:12:34.166
This is what I regret and what I might lose tomorrow.

178
00:12:35.666 --> 00:12:37.406
I'd rather mope around like this a little more.

179
00:12:38.906 --> 00:12:40.475
Sure, whatever.

180
00:12:41.705 --> 00:12:42.845
Good luck then.

181
00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:46.276
Unbelievable.

182
00:13:02.266 --> 00:13:03.296
Gosh.

183
00:13:03.666 --> 00:13:06.036
I came by to ask for a favor,

184
00:13:06.036 --> 00:13:07.735
but you're in no position to help me.

185
00:13:08.036 --> 00:13:09.866
What kind of a favor is it?

186
00:13:10.065 --> 00:13:13.435
Ha Ri might grow old all alone at this rate.

187
00:13:13.735 --> 00:13:15.075
She doesn't seem to want to get married.

188
00:13:15.136 --> 00:13:17.075
All she cares about is her job now.

189
00:13:17.305 --> 00:13:19.876
What if she lives a lonely life forever?

190
00:13:20.176 --> 00:13:22.315
She wouldn't be lonely.

191
00:13:22.416 --> 00:13:25.085
She'll find someone and live happily ever after.

192
00:13:26.315 --> 00:13:28.985
Jae Young. Stay by her side...

193
00:13:28.985 --> 00:13:30.325
and be with her.

194
00:13:30.725 --> 00:13:33.426
You need to live with people to find new people.

195
00:13:34.026 --> 00:13:36.965
If you two grow on each other, you can settle down together.

196
00:13:38.766 --> 00:13:40.796
How could you say something so frightening?

197
00:13:42.305 --> 00:13:44.335
- Is Ha Ri frightening? - Come on.

198
00:13:44.835 --> 00:13:46.276
Think about it.

199
00:13:46.935 --> 00:13:50.575
She and I are like brother and sister.

200
00:13:50.646 --> 00:13:52.376
Exactly. I'm saying...

201
00:13:52.376 --> 00:13:54.676
be close like you're brother and sister.

202
00:13:57.886 --> 00:13:59.256
Darn it.

203
00:14:09.426 --> 00:14:13.296
Seriously. She keeps worrying me.

204
00:14:16.205 --> 00:14:19.205
Hey, get up. Let's have some soju.

205
00:14:19.205 --> 00:14:20.276
Get up!

206
00:14:20.705 --> 00:14:21.705
Get off.

207
00:14:22.136 --> 00:14:23.705
Fine, you have beer.

208
00:14:24.205 --> 00:14:25.876
Why you little...

209
00:14:26.075 --> 00:14:29.146
What are you doing? Slapstick? Your face is funny enough.

210
00:14:31.516 --> 00:14:32.555
Hey.

211
00:14:34.256 --> 00:14:36.626
Take this and go. Don't come back.

212
00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:37.685
What is this?

213
00:14:37.685 --> 00:14:39.926
Do Ah's pajamas. It's a parting gift.

214
00:14:40.095 --> 00:14:42.396
Bye. Let's never meet again. Go.

215
00:14:43.195 --> 00:14:44.296
Why did you buy this?

216
00:14:44.296 --> 00:14:46.965
I bought you that, so leave. I don't want to look at you.

217
00:14:46.965 --> 00:14:48.195
Go.

218
00:14:48.866 --> 00:14:51.465
I don't think it'll work with me. That's our destiny.

219
00:14:51.735 --> 00:14:53.735
What are you babbling about? Go.

220
00:14:55.975 --> 00:14:57.575
Since you gave me a gift,

221
00:15:01.345 --> 00:15:02.985
should I set you up with a guy?

222
00:15:09.855 --> 00:15:13.195
When did I say I needed a guy?

223
00:15:19.195 --> 00:15:20.536
Do you really not?

224
00:15:20.766 --> 00:15:24.366
You seemed to be kicking yourself for not trying hard enough.

225
00:15:27.235 --> 00:15:28.276
Well...

226
00:15:29.176 --> 00:15:32.345
I think it may be too soon to give up, but...

227
00:15:32.616 --> 00:15:34.116
So? Should I set you up?

228
00:15:37.046 --> 00:15:38.985
It's okay.

229
00:15:39.855 --> 00:15:42.626
There's no guarantee that I'll meet a nice guy just because I try.

230
00:15:43.225 --> 00:15:45.585
Well, if you know someone...

231
00:15:46.156 --> 00:15:48.055
who looks nice,

232
00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:50.296
is a good person,

233
00:15:50.296 --> 00:15:52.126
and has a good sense of humor...

234
00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:55.396
I don't care about looks, so an average guy will do.

235
00:15:55.965 --> 00:15:57.766
But you wouldn't know anyone like that.

236
00:15:58.406 --> 00:16:00.876
What was that? Is that a yes or no?

237
00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:03.475
Are you saying yes if I know someone like that?

238
00:16:03.475 --> 00:16:05.305
If you do, you can try setting me up.

239
00:16:09.016 --> 00:16:10.916
There are too many voices inside of you, right?

240
00:16:11.116 --> 00:16:12.416
Just stick to one.

241
00:16:14.585 --> 00:16:16.355
Thanks for the pajamas.

242
00:16:16.756 --> 00:16:18.256
Brush your teeth and go to sleep.

243
00:16:25.166 --> 00:16:27.435
A seven-percent probability to get naturally pregnant...

244
00:16:27.435 --> 00:16:29.536
doesn't mean it's entirely impossible to have a baby.

245
00:16:29.906 --> 00:16:32.305
But your fecundity will continue to decrease.

246
00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.416
Good. You're doing good.

247
00:16:51.685 --> 00:16:52.725
Let me take a picture.

248
00:17:01.636 --> 00:17:04.305
"Because I've never tried wall climbing."

249
00:17:04.906 --> 00:17:06.205
(Share)

250
00:17:08.906 --> 00:17:09.945
(This is The Baby!)

251
00:17:11.075 --> 00:17:13.845
(Followers)

252
00:17:18.815 --> 00:17:20.185
They're all pictures of babies.

253
00:17:45.545 --> 00:17:46.745
Do Ah, where's Daddy?

254
00:17:47.545 --> 00:17:48.576
Do Ah.

255
00:17:49.445 --> 00:17:50.586
Daddy's gone.

256
00:17:51.646 --> 00:17:52.856
Here's Daddy.

257
00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:03.495
You didn't have to come. You could've just called.

258
00:18:03.765 --> 00:18:06.195
- You jerk. - Why you...

259
00:18:07.235 --> 00:18:09.306
Why did you come here? It's so sad.

260
00:18:09.336 --> 00:18:11.836
There aren't many kids' zones.

261
00:18:12.735 --> 00:18:14.136
You've been out for five months, right?

262
00:18:14.705 --> 00:18:15.806
How about expenses?

263
00:18:16.076 --> 00:18:17.576
I sold my house.

264
00:18:18.775 --> 00:18:19.846
Aren't you going to work again?

265
00:18:20.346 --> 00:18:24.116
I don't know. It's too hard finding someone to watch a baby.

266
00:18:31.826 --> 00:18:34.295
Gosh. What is this?

267
00:18:36.566 --> 00:18:38.666
Jeong Won asked me to give you her child support payment.

268
00:18:50.245 --> 00:18:53.146
She abandoned her own baby. Tell her to stay out of our lives.

269
00:18:59.656 --> 00:19:03.285
It's hard to become strangers even if you get a divorce.

270
00:19:05.755 --> 00:19:06.955
Although I accomplished it.

271
00:19:13.166 --> 00:19:14.235
Hey.

272
00:19:17.435 --> 00:19:18.566
Want to meet a girl?

273
00:19:24.005 --> 00:19:25.376
What's this? How annoying.

274
00:19:28.275 --> 00:19:29.685
Mr. Nam.

275
00:19:29.846 --> 00:19:32.586
I saw that guy. Han I Sang.

276
00:19:33.515 --> 00:19:35.985
He's the one that said he didn't like me.

277
00:19:36.725 --> 00:19:39.056
Why is he liking my post?

278
00:19:45.995 --> 00:19:47.035
Was it wrong to like it?

279
00:19:50.336 --> 00:19:52.406
What's going on? What are you doing here?

280
00:19:53.235 --> 00:19:55.676
You follow people and like their posts.

281
00:19:55.876 --> 00:19:57.205
Isn't that how you do social media?

282
00:19:58.245 --> 00:19:59.275
Are we close?

283
00:19:59.275 --> 00:20:01.245
Do you do that only with people you're close to?

284
00:20:01.275 --> 00:20:02.586
People follow people they don't know.

285
00:20:02.586 --> 00:20:04.616
I only follow people I'm close to.

286
00:20:06.285 --> 00:20:09.116
- Then cut me out. - I didn't accept it. You cancel it.

287
00:20:09.685 --> 00:20:10.725
Fine.

288
00:20:11.455 --> 00:20:14.326
Are you two childhood friends? You seem very close.

289
00:20:14.495 --> 00:20:16.396
Continue to be close going forward.

290
00:20:17.426 --> 00:20:19.025
I feel like I should be angry right now.

291
00:20:19.025 --> 00:20:20.535
You said I wouldn't run into her.

292
00:20:21.396 --> 00:20:23.066
I tried.

293
00:20:23.066 --> 00:20:26.876
But you two met before I was ready. This is very awkward for me.

294
00:20:37.215 --> 00:20:39.556
You seem to hate me today.

295
00:20:39.985 --> 00:20:42.116
You said you were so grateful, you could propose to me.

296
00:20:43.426 --> 00:20:45.455
It was my way of thanking you.

297
00:20:45.525 --> 00:20:47.326
I felt grateful enough to even propose to you.

298
00:20:49.695 --> 00:20:50.866
I Sang.

299
00:20:51.866 --> 00:20:53.265
No, Mr. Han.

300
00:20:54.166 --> 00:20:55.735
Let's have a proper conversation.

301
00:20:59.906 --> 00:21:00.975
Just us.

302
00:21:06.416 --> 00:21:08.445
You won't keep using the studio, will you?

303
00:21:09.245 --> 00:21:10.316
Why?

304
00:21:10.445 --> 00:21:12.316
I'll set my schedule to avoid the times you're there.

305
00:21:12.916 --> 00:21:13.955
Why?

306
00:21:14.685 --> 00:21:17.455
Aren't you uncomfortable with me? I'm very uncomfortable.

307
00:21:17.685 --> 00:21:19.626
I'm fine.

308
00:21:19.626 --> 00:21:21.096
Are you still uncomfortable with me?

309
00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:23.096
It would be weird if I were comfortable.

310
00:21:23.426 --> 00:21:25.566
You told me to just get a dog when we first met.

311
00:21:27.265 --> 00:21:28.836
If you look at it that way,

312
00:21:28.935 --> 00:21:31.066
I'm the one who should've been more offended.

313
00:21:32.535 --> 00:21:34.035
- About what? - Don't you remember?

314
00:21:36.606 --> 00:21:38.606
What would offend...

315
00:22:05.435 --> 00:22:06.475
Hey.

316
00:22:10.945 --> 00:22:12.945
Hey. Where are you going?

317
00:22:13.176 --> 00:22:14.245
What's wrong with you?

318
00:22:15.076 --> 00:22:17.086
Sit down. Sit.

319
00:22:29.195 --> 00:22:30.666
Do you despise women?

320
00:22:31.396 --> 00:22:33.535
- What? - You said,

321
00:22:33.695 --> 00:22:36.066
if a woman shows interest,

322
00:22:36.066 --> 00:22:38.606
it was because of this and that.

323
00:22:38.606 --> 00:22:40.136
Isn't that the same thing?

324
00:22:41.836 --> 00:22:45.306
How did you develop such a twisted prejudice?

325
00:22:47.076 --> 00:22:49.445
I'm about to develop a prejudice.

326
00:22:56.856 --> 00:22:59.156
Do you think I don't understand because I'm drunk?

327
00:22:59.396 --> 00:23:02.656
You're saying you don't like me.

328
00:23:03.695 --> 00:23:05.666
I don't like you either.

329
00:23:07.066 --> 00:23:10.465
Had I known you were a psycho, I wouldn't have mustered up courage.

330
00:23:16.035 --> 00:23:17.306
You read me correctly.

331
00:23:18.306 --> 00:23:20.416
I'm not the guy you're looking for.

332
00:23:23.445 --> 00:23:26.386
What if you fall for me?

333
00:23:30.025 --> 00:23:32.386
I swear you'll fall for me.

334
00:23:33.896 --> 00:23:37.326
Who gets drunk enough to say something like that?

335
00:23:40.995 --> 00:23:45.265
You told me I'd fall for you.

336
00:23:46.636 --> 00:23:48.475
- So did you fall for me? - No.

337
00:23:48.475 --> 00:23:49.876
- Do you plan to? - No.

338
00:23:49.876 --> 00:23:51.045
Then what's your point?

339
00:23:52.146 --> 00:23:54.475
Why are you taking it out on me?

340
00:23:54.676 --> 00:23:56.386
You're the one who guaranteed it.

341
00:23:59.285 --> 00:24:02.886
Anyway, I'll do my best to avoid you so things don't get awkward.

342
00:24:02.886 --> 00:24:05.455
- I expect you to cooperate as well. - Sure.

343
00:24:05.455 --> 00:24:07.225
Let's try our best not to run into each other.

344
00:24:08.255 --> 00:24:10.566
- Okay. - That was nice and easy.

345
00:24:10.566 --> 00:24:12.366
Here. This is for my drink.

346
00:24:22.336 --> 00:24:23.475
What do you mean the photographer isn't here?

347
00:24:23.775 --> 00:24:25.975
I have an interview with Yeon Ho.

348
00:24:25.975 --> 00:24:27.916
Why isn't anyone here yet?

349
00:24:27.916 --> 00:24:29.116
They're coming.

350
00:24:29.116 --> 00:24:32.086
It's going to take over an hour to set things up and do the shoot.

351
00:24:32.285 --> 00:24:35.156
Yeon Ho is interviewing a famous photographer from abroad.

352
00:24:35.156 --> 00:24:36.525
I can't do both.

353
00:24:36.525 --> 00:24:37.926
It's a cover shoot.

354
00:24:38.086 --> 00:24:40.725
I can't postpone it. We also need to do a video shoot.

355
00:24:42.225 --> 00:24:44.225
I had a really hard time casting Na Eun.

356
00:24:44.225 --> 00:24:46.096
You know how popular she is these days.

357
00:24:46.096 --> 00:24:48.435
- Aunt. - Did you hear that? Even guys...

358
00:24:50.035 --> 00:24:51.765
I must be crazy.

359
00:24:53.136 --> 00:24:55.836
Hello, I'm Choi Kang Eu Ddeum from the Advertising Team.

360
00:24:57.045 --> 00:24:58.245
You were an idol star, weren't you?

361
00:24:58.245 --> 00:24:59.545
You seem very familiar.

362
00:24:59.876 --> 00:25:04.086
No, my last name is made up with both of my parents' last names.

363
00:25:04.346 --> 00:25:05.386
You have two last names?

364
00:25:05.685 --> 00:25:07.086
Eu Ddeum, what are you doing here?

365
00:25:07.185 --> 00:25:08.985
Mr. Kim told me it's a very important client...

366
00:25:08.985 --> 00:25:10.826
and that I should help you get a contract renewal.

367
00:25:11.025 --> 00:25:13.656
He sent you here to deal with an important client?

368
00:25:13.725 --> 00:25:15.495
I didn't know he trusted me so much either.

369
00:25:15.725 --> 00:25:17.366
I promise I'll do my best to help.

370
00:25:19.225 --> 00:25:22.096
Ha Ri, I don't have time. You need to make a choice.

371
00:25:33.168 --> 00:25:34.699
No, I don't want to.

372
00:25:35.168 --> 00:25:36.368
You don't want to?

373
00:25:36.699 --> 00:25:38.999
That means you still can.

374
00:25:38.999 --> 00:25:40.469
Can you help us just this once?

375
00:25:40.469 --> 00:25:42.608
You do your job, and I'll do mine.

376
00:25:42.608 --> 00:25:44.608
I'm only here to share your working space.

377
00:25:44.638 --> 00:25:46.578
This is a great part-time job.

378
00:25:46.578 --> 00:25:48.078
You can make money, get good practice,

379
00:25:48.078 --> 00:25:49.449
and get the hang of it again.

380
00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:52.549
Why would he practice with our cover shoot?

381
00:25:52.848 --> 00:25:54.289
It's just a figure of speech.

382
00:25:55.249 --> 00:25:56.489
Forget it. That's enough.

383
00:25:56.588 --> 00:25:58.019
We're stooping too low.

384
00:26:01.588 --> 00:26:05.598
I'm sorry for asking you a favor when I promised to avoid you.

385
00:26:09.668 --> 00:26:13.469
But did you have to make us talk facing your back?

386
00:26:13.638 --> 00:26:16.509
It's not like you have a really broad back anyway.

387
00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:25.279
Gosh.

388
00:26:26.249 --> 00:26:28.418
Hey, you're here. You came a long way.

389
00:26:28.848 --> 00:26:30.959
- Hi. - Hello.

390
00:26:31.219 --> 00:26:33.289
Gosh, they're here. My goodness.

391
00:26:37.158 --> 00:26:39.128
Hey, give me the draft.

392
00:26:39.699 --> 00:26:40.729
We don't have time.

393
00:26:42.368 --> 00:26:45.569
Na Eun, you can stand right here.

394
00:26:45.739 --> 00:26:47.239
Hurry up. We don't have time.

395
00:26:47.239 --> 00:26:49.938
There's not much time, so I'll make it quick.

396
00:26:50.108 --> 00:26:54.608
This is harmless to humans, so kids can suck on it.

397
00:26:54.608 --> 00:26:56.749
Hey, don't put it in your mouth. It's dirty.

398
00:26:56.749 --> 00:26:57.949
It's filthy.

399
00:26:58.378 --> 00:26:59.449
Gosh, how dirty.

400
00:27:03.088 --> 00:27:07.029
Is there anything else you'd like us to emphasize?

401
00:27:07.289 --> 00:27:09.229
Right. And let's see.

402
00:27:09.658 --> 00:27:11.499
It's very durable.

403
00:27:11.598 --> 00:27:13.799
Kids sometimes throw stuff,

404
00:27:13.799 --> 00:27:15.969
but it doesn't break that easily.

405
00:27:19.668 --> 00:27:20.908
This is so weak.

406
00:27:23.138 --> 00:27:24.608
And... And what else is there?

407
00:27:25.239 --> 00:27:28.648
I have to urgently go somewhere.

408
00:27:29.878 --> 00:27:31.479
Can you assemble everything back together?

409
00:27:32.418 --> 00:27:35.749
Yes, of course. I can do it with my eyes closed.

410
00:27:35.749 --> 00:27:38.819
- Don't worry. - Okay, thank you in advance.

411
00:27:38.819 --> 00:27:40.358
- Sure. You should go. - Okay.

412
00:27:40.358 --> 00:27:41.459
Bye.

413
00:27:47.098 --> 00:27:48.368
How much time do we have left?

414
00:27:48.628 --> 00:27:51.638
Seung Ho. Seung Ho, wake up!

415
00:27:51.969 --> 00:27:52.969
What time is it?

416
00:27:53.209 --> 00:27:54.938
- 3:50pm. - We have 10 minutes left.

417
00:27:55.168 --> 00:27:57.578
- Gosh, my hands are shaking. - We can do it.

418
00:27:58.838 --> 00:27:59.979
My goodness.

419
00:28:01.049 --> 00:28:03.519
Aunt, is this how you do it?

420
00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:07.219
I'm really busy right now. Will you please leave me alone?

421
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:08.618
Ha Ri.

422
00:28:09.449 --> 00:28:11.688
I think you should take a look.

423
00:28:17.999 --> 00:28:19.128
Is this how you do it?

424
00:28:21.799 --> 00:28:22.868
You look adorable.

425
00:28:23.938 --> 00:28:25.969
No, I can't do this. There's no time.

426
00:28:26.239 --> 00:28:27.769
What are you doing?

427
00:28:27.868 --> 00:28:31.938
I really need to go to Yeon Ho's interview on time.

428
00:28:31.938 --> 00:28:33.908
If I'm late to this one, it'll be an international embarrassment.

429
00:28:33.908 --> 00:28:35.078
What are you talking about?

430
00:28:35.078 --> 00:28:37.549
- I can't... - We can't postpone this one.

431
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:38.878
- Please. - I have to go.

432
00:28:38.878 --> 00:28:40.019
Please just take a couple of photos.

433
00:28:40.088 --> 00:28:41.188
Give me the draft.

434
00:28:45.989 --> 00:28:47.158
I don't like babies.

435
00:28:47.459 --> 00:28:48.628
So you can be the one to make her smile.

436
00:28:50.059 --> 00:28:51.128
What do I need to do?

437
00:28:52.828 --> 00:28:56.398
She's a baby model, so make sure she smiles.

438
00:28:56.638 --> 00:28:57.799
And the toys need to show.

439
00:28:57.799 --> 00:29:00.009
The draft is right here. Do me a favor.

440
00:29:00.009 --> 00:29:02.108
I'm sorry. Thank you, I Sang.

441
00:29:02.408 --> 00:29:03.479
Sorry!

442
00:29:10.378 --> 00:29:12.618
You're adorable! Look over here!

443
00:29:13.819 --> 00:29:16.348
Na Eun, raise your hand! Smile!

444
00:29:21.358 --> 00:29:23.759
Hey, can you smile a little?

445
00:29:24.059 --> 00:29:25.199
She'll cry because of you.

446
00:29:26.699 --> 00:29:28.828
Does my back still look small to you?

447
00:29:35.168 --> 00:29:37.239
It kind of looks broader now.

448
00:29:38.479 --> 00:29:41.108
Na Eun, let me join you!

449
00:29:41.108 --> 00:29:43.219
Hey, look. Na Eun, look at the bubbles.

450
00:29:43.219 --> 00:29:45.418
Look how pretty the bubbles are!

451
00:29:51.959 --> 00:29:53.759
What about Mr. Kim in the Publishing Team?

452
00:29:58.898 --> 00:30:00.069
People say he's gay.

453
00:30:02.628 --> 00:30:04.168
What about Mr. Oh in the Monthly Fashion Team?

454
00:30:08.009 --> 00:30:09.438
He's already dating someone.

455
00:30:11.878 --> 00:30:13.148
What are we going to do with Ha Ri?

456
00:30:13.309 --> 00:30:14.749
I can't believe there's no one...

457
00:30:16.378 --> 00:30:17.449
to introduce to her.

458
00:30:20.719 --> 00:30:23.319
If you date a colleague, you'll have a lot in common,

459
00:30:23.319 --> 00:30:25.418
and it's also great because they understand your hardships.

460
00:30:25.418 --> 00:30:28.559
But it's hard to actually date someone in the first place.

461
00:30:29.358 --> 00:30:31.059
Would you date a colleague?

462
00:30:31.059 --> 00:30:33.769
Gosh, no way. Our company sucks.

463
00:30:36.098 --> 00:30:37.769
See? She works here,

464
00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:39.569
but she wants to date someone who works at a better company.

465
00:30:40.168 --> 00:30:43.539
You normally badmouth your colleagues, not fall in love.

466
00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:47.279
Actually, I'm dating Seung Ho in the Camera Team.

467
00:30:47.608 --> 00:30:48.749
- Since when? - Since when?

468
00:30:50.178 --> 00:30:53.549
I asked him out the day Ha Ri said we'll end up just like her.

469
00:30:54.388 --> 00:30:56.519
- You're amazing. - Thanks.

470
00:30:58.019 --> 00:31:02.688
Anyway, there's a reason why people don't date their colleagues.

471
00:31:02.989 --> 00:31:04.699
But if she fails to find someone outside of work,

472
00:31:05.059 --> 00:31:07.668
we'll have to keep watching her live a sad life.

473
00:31:18.378 --> 00:31:20.249
I know you'll be at the beauty salon.

474
00:31:21.709 --> 00:31:23.618
I'm going to Gangnam for business.

475
00:31:23.719 --> 00:31:25.348
I can easily drop by.

476
00:31:26.118 --> 00:31:28.348
Okay. Bye.

477
00:31:29.049 --> 00:31:31.819
Ha Ri, are you going on a blind date?

478
00:31:31.989 --> 00:31:33.059
No.

479
00:31:33.388 --> 00:31:37.828
Oh, I see. But still, you can't carry everything dressed like that.

480
00:31:37.959 --> 00:31:39.868
It's the weekend, so there won't be a lot of empty cabs either.

481
00:31:39.868 --> 00:31:42.398
Hey, you should give her a lift. You're also heading to Gangnam.

482
00:31:42.969 --> 00:31:44.938
- No, I'm not. - You're not?

483
00:31:45.838 --> 00:31:47.239
Forget it.

484
00:31:49.239 --> 00:31:50.338
I'll see you.

485
00:31:51.438 --> 00:31:53.039
But I'm sure that's heavy.

486
00:31:53.479 --> 00:31:54.549
Or maybe not.

487
00:31:55.378 --> 00:31:56.449
Hey.

488
00:32:31.118 --> 00:32:33.449
I lied earlier. I'm heading that way, so I'll give you a lift.

489
00:32:33.719 --> 00:32:35.688
- No thanks. - I wouldn't mind the company.

490
00:32:35.688 --> 00:32:36.858
Well, I would.

491
00:32:38.519 --> 00:32:40.088
I'll park here until you hop in.

492
00:32:42.358 --> 00:32:45.398
We should stay clear of each other, so I'll get in the back.

493
00:32:56.608 --> 00:32:57.608
Thanks.

494
00:32:58.739 --> 00:32:59.809
Okay.

495
00:33:12.188 --> 00:33:13.489
Thanks. Have a good day.

496
00:33:35.678 --> 00:33:36.949
You said you're off to a wedding.

497
00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:38.749
I can drop you off, so hop in.

498
00:33:42.319 --> 00:33:43.558
Must I get the door for you too?

499
00:33:57.268 --> 00:33:58.268
Thanks.

500
00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:06.079
My cousin is getting married today.

501
00:34:07.449 --> 00:34:09.808
You gave me a ride, so why don't you stay for a meal?

502
00:34:11.579 --> 00:34:13.989
- No thanks. - The snow crabs are to die for.

503
00:34:14.748 --> 00:34:17.219
I'll treat you to a meal next time then. Thanks.

504
00:34:22.088 --> 00:34:23.398
Snow crabs?

505
00:34:27.029 --> 00:34:28.898
- Auntie, congratulations. - Thanks, Ha Ri.

506
00:34:28.898 --> 00:34:30.668
You made time out of your busy schedule?

507
00:34:30.668 --> 00:34:32.199
It's true that I've been busy.

508
00:34:32.199 --> 00:34:33.509
Anyway, head that way.

509
00:34:34.569 --> 00:34:36.369
- Hello. - I'm so glad you came.

510
00:34:36.369 --> 00:34:37.739
Gosh, thank you.

511
00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:39.978
- Ok Ran! - My goodness.

512
00:34:39.978 --> 00:34:42.378
The traffic was awful on my way here.

513
00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:45.418
I can't believe you look prettier than the bride today.

514
00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:47.949
Exactly. She should've known better.

515
00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:50.288
Anyway, congratulations. You must be ecstatic.

516
00:34:52.759 --> 00:34:55.228
Ha Ri said she couldn't come because of a deadline.

517
00:34:55.228 --> 00:34:56.958
You have no idea how sorry she is.

518
00:34:57.958 --> 00:34:59.558
What are you talking about?

519
00:34:59.898 --> 00:35:02.299
Ha Ri's already here.

520
00:35:02.628 --> 00:35:03.668
She's over there.

521
00:35:06.139 --> 00:35:08.009
Gosh, congratulations.

522
00:35:11.808 --> 00:35:13.409
You look stunning.

523
00:35:13.779 --> 00:35:15.449
I sense the tears coming.

524
00:35:16.308 --> 00:35:18.418
One might think you raised me.

525
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:20.518
You said you couldn't come.

526
00:35:21.288 --> 00:35:22.719
It wasn't easy to free up my schedule.

527
00:35:22.989 --> 00:35:25.058
Anyway, I even got you a huge gift.

528
00:35:26.018 --> 00:35:27.029
As in what?

529
00:35:39.369 --> 00:35:41.208
You should've told me that you were coming.

530
00:35:41.569 --> 00:35:43.708
How can I cover for you when you don't tell me things?

531
00:35:44.338 --> 00:35:46.509
Come to think of it, this is where my best shot lies.

532
00:35:46.779 --> 00:35:48.409
Quite a number of bachelors will be here...

533
00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:50.819
and watching the ceremony will plant the idea of marriage.

534
00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:52.449
What on earth are you saying?

535
00:35:58.159 --> 00:35:59.319
Stop shaking your legs.

536
00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:01.688
I'm nervous, that's all.

537
00:36:01.759 --> 00:36:03.429
Why would you be when it's not your wedding?

538
00:36:09.029 --> 00:36:12.139
Next, we have a guest performer...

539
00:36:12.139 --> 00:36:14.168
who will like to present...

540
00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:17.708
a nuptial song to wish the couple's happiness.

541
00:36:18.179 --> 00:36:20.509
It's none other than the bride's...

542
00:36:20.509 --> 00:36:21.949
- cousin. - Where are you going?

543
00:36:22.009 --> 00:36:23.308
Could you join us up here?

544
00:36:26.779 --> 00:36:28.018
- What... - Ha Ri?

545
00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:30.619
- Honey, goodness. - My gosh.

546
00:36:33.018 --> 00:36:36.759
Hello, I'm Eun Joo's older cousin,

547
00:36:36.759 --> 00:36:38.259
Jang Ha Ri.

548
00:36:38.929 --> 00:36:42.299
I know I look young to be older than her, but still.

549
00:36:43.128 --> 00:36:45.038
I'm only slightly older than her.

550
00:36:45.498 --> 00:36:48.208
My singing isn't nowhere near perfect,

551
00:36:48.739 --> 00:36:50.579
but I hope you enjoy it...

552
00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:53.079
and consider it as...

553
00:36:53.079 --> 00:36:55.179
my way of wishing her...

554
00:36:55.409 --> 00:36:56.679
a happy marriage.

555
00:36:59.619 --> 00:37:00.719
Cue, music.

556
00:37:18.239 --> 00:37:21.509
Fill me with your love

557
00:37:21.608 --> 00:37:25.179
I guess my love needs to be recharged

558
00:37:25.478 --> 00:37:29.608
I can't live without you, I really can't

559
00:37:29.878 --> 00:37:32.779
You're my battery that charges my love

560
00:37:33.518 --> 00:37:36.188
I don't care if you're not super handsome

561
00:37:37.219 --> 00:37:39.788
I don't care if you don't have the fittest body

562
00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:43.929
But you who will care for me dearly

563
00:37:44.299 --> 00:37:47.099
You are the man of my dreams

564
00:37:48.199 --> 00:37:50.739
Hug me once more

565
00:37:51.799 --> 00:37:54.909
Embrace me in your arms until my heart bursts

566
00:37:55.509 --> 00:37:58.538
I guess my love needs to be recharged

567
00:37:58.978 --> 00:38:01.849
That's why you're the one I need

568
00:38:02.148 --> 00:38:05.319
Fill me with your love

569
00:38:05.619 --> 00:38:09.248
I guess my love needs to be recharged

570
00:38:09.449 --> 00:38:13.188
I can't live without you, I really can't

571
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:16.558
You're my battery that charges my love

572
00:38:30.208 --> 00:38:31.338
Ms. Jang...

573
00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:56.199
What on earth?

574
00:38:56.228 --> 00:38:58.699
Why are you getting in people's way?

575
00:38:59.168 --> 00:39:00.739
I'm not blocking anyone's path.

576
00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:03.469
But because of you...

577
00:39:06.478 --> 00:39:07.549
Why are you here?

578
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:10.349
My meal ticket.

579
00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:16.088
I haven't had snow crabs before.

580
00:39:16.119 --> 00:39:17.418
Only blue crabs.

581
00:39:24.159 --> 00:39:25.329
Thank you.

582
00:39:25.759 --> 00:39:27.829
The dining hall is this way.

583
00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:34.438
I was just about to get lucky.

584
00:39:41.849 --> 00:39:44.918
Ha Ri, that's enough. You look desperate.

585
00:39:44.918 --> 00:39:47.148
If you know what I'm doing, start looking too.

586
00:39:47.148 --> 00:39:50.858
How old is Eun Joo's husband again? 32?

587
00:39:51.188 --> 00:39:53.588
Does he have an older brother? A young uncle wouldn't be so bad.

588
00:39:53.889 --> 00:39:55.659
Don't embarrass yourself and just eat your meal.

589
00:39:58.358 --> 00:40:00.128
Mom, can you keep an eye on him?

590
00:40:00.199 --> 00:40:02.168
- Sure. - I need to go to the restroom.

591
00:40:02.268 --> 00:40:03.938
- Go ahead. - Come to Grandma.

592
00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:06.069
What would you like?

593
00:40:07.038 --> 00:40:08.069
- Good boy. - Look at him eat.

594
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:09.538
My sweet little puppy.

595
00:40:12.378 --> 00:40:13.608
Your singing was amazing.

596
00:40:16.579 --> 00:40:18.418
Ha Ri, you've got a successful career,

597
00:40:18.418 --> 00:40:19.779
so stick to living alone.

598
00:40:20.319 --> 00:40:22.288
You haven't been able to get married or have a child,

599
00:40:22.288 --> 00:40:24.018
so living alone would be more comfortable.

600
00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:26.819
Who cares if you're a little lonely?

601
00:40:28.228 --> 00:40:31.398
Just earn enough money to live in a retirement home.

602
00:40:32.329 --> 00:40:34.898
Did you hear about the old people there...

603
00:40:34.898 --> 00:40:36.398
getting beat up these days?

604
00:40:36.668 --> 00:40:38.338
Only animals would do such a thing.

605
00:40:38.338 --> 00:40:39.699
Tell me about it.

606
00:40:40.838 --> 00:40:42.168
Dig in.

607
00:40:42.639 --> 00:40:44.108
I'm going to get married.

608
00:40:47.179 --> 00:40:49.549
My mom should be congratulated too, you know.

609
00:40:50.208 --> 00:40:52.549
Please set me up with anyone decent you know.

610
00:40:52.619 --> 00:40:54.819
Auntie, set a blind date if you find anyone.

611
00:40:54.889 --> 00:40:56.989
Got it? Is everyone on board? Good.

612
00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:08.498
Goodness, the snow crabs have been served.

613
00:41:08.498 --> 00:41:09.869
- What? - Hold on.

614
00:41:10.369 --> 00:41:12.639
- The snow crabs? - Auntie, wait.

615
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:14.308
Auntie?

616
00:41:15.009 --> 00:41:16.009
Crabs...

617
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:24.978
They care more about the snow crabs than you.

618
00:41:29.049 --> 00:41:30.489
Your aunt already set you up with numerous men.

619
00:41:30.489 --> 00:41:33.929
Who would she have left for someone who's close to 40?

620
00:41:33.929 --> 00:41:37.128
No one's been interested in you for a few years now!

621
00:41:53.378 --> 00:41:56.208
Anyway, who gets married at a young age these days.

622
00:41:56.878 --> 00:41:59.248
A lot of women marry at your age.

623
00:42:00.619 --> 00:42:01.989
Don't think you're running out of time.

624
00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:04.389
The man that's meant to be will turn up.

625
00:42:08.989 --> 00:42:12.358
I thought it was my bad luck that kept me from marriage,

626
00:42:14.429 --> 00:42:16.329
but you're having it tough because of me too.

627
00:42:18.199 --> 00:42:20.369
You can't enjoy having a son-in-law and grandchildren.

628
00:42:22.338 --> 00:42:25.108
What can't I enjoy? That's not all that great.

629
00:42:25.108 --> 00:42:26.179
I enjoy myself just fine.

630
00:42:28.179 --> 00:42:29.279
And...

631
00:42:31.119 --> 00:42:32.619
don't look in strange places.

632
00:42:33.418 --> 00:42:35.049
Look close by.

633
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:36.449
Don't you know?

634
00:42:36.719 --> 00:42:39.788
The bluebird is in the small room in your house.

635
00:42:42.088 --> 00:42:43.259
Why is that there?

636
00:43:06.378 --> 00:43:09.219
(Han I Sang)

637
00:43:09.489 --> 00:43:10.688
Why did you go to Gangnam?

638
00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:11.918
I said I'd come here.

639
00:43:12.989 --> 00:43:15.159
I went to watch a dance for a bit.

640
00:43:15.558 --> 00:43:16.688
- A dance? - Yes.

641
00:43:30.369 --> 00:43:31.409
Jang Ha Ri.

642
00:43:46.088 --> 00:43:47.389
Here's the dancer.

643
00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:50.489
Dancer? Where?

644
00:43:51.398 --> 00:43:52.759
- Where? - Never mind.

645
00:43:52.759 --> 00:43:54.869
- Hello. It's nice to meet you. - Hello.

646
00:43:55.768 --> 00:43:59.699
It's dinner time. Why don't we go eat?

647
00:43:59.699 --> 00:44:00.838
I ordered already.

648
00:44:01.208 --> 00:44:02.268
What would you like?

649
00:44:06.478 --> 00:44:07.808
Iced Americano.

650
00:44:08.179 --> 00:44:09.549
- Pardon? - Just a minute.

651
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:12.449
Shall we go?

652
00:44:13.748 --> 00:44:16.518
I want to have some more coffee. Their coffee is good.

653
00:44:24.228 --> 00:44:25.299
Hot Americano.

654
00:44:28.268 --> 00:44:29.829
- Yes. - Mine is iced.

655
00:44:31.898 --> 00:44:33.768
Jae Young told you about me, right?

656
00:44:35.139 --> 00:44:37.838
He said you were married briefly.

657
00:44:38.308 --> 00:44:40.409
You must've been hesitant about meeting a divorcee.

658
00:44:40.409 --> 00:44:44.478
Not at all. I get so much judgment for not being married.

659
00:44:44.478 --> 00:44:47.049
There are times when I think being divorced is better.

660
00:44:47.389 --> 00:44:48.719
I got married when I was 40 too.

661
00:44:52.389 --> 00:44:55.058
You never imagined you'd still be single at this age, right?

662
00:44:57.329 --> 00:44:58.429
No.

663
00:45:00.699 --> 00:45:03.268
It gets harder to meet people the older you get.

664
00:45:03.398 --> 00:45:05.969
To be honest, there's a lot of pressure.

665
00:45:06.199 --> 00:45:07.608
I realized from being married,

666
00:45:07.909 --> 00:45:10.978
that the couple's families must adjust as well as the couple.

667
00:45:12.239 --> 00:45:13.378
It isn't easy.

668
00:45:17.009 --> 00:45:19.279
Dating and marriage...

669
00:45:20.119 --> 00:45:21.319
are all so hard.

670
00:45:26.288 --> 00:45:27.389
Even if...

671
00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:32.299
it takes a while,

672
00:45:34.569 --> 00:45:36.199
why don't we get closer slowly?

673
00:45:40.599 --> 00:45:45.338
If you say a while and slowly... How long?

674
00:45:46.538 --> 00:45:48.478
It'll be hard to have kids if I wait too long.

675
00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:49.648
Kids...

676
00:45:50.949 --> 00:45:55.449
You can have kids when you're 60 if you have the money.

677
00:45:55.449 --> 00:45:57.349
Even Trump had a son when he was 60.

678
00:46:00.358 --> 00:46:02.329
A woman can't have kids in their 60s.

679
00:46:05.159 --> 00:46:08.369
So, saying I have 10 years until menopause,

680
00:46:08.469 --> 00:46:10.869
12 times a year for 10 years is 120.

681
00:46:10.869 --> 00:46:13.469
I only have 120 chances at getting pregnant.

682
00:46:13.469 --> 00:46:15.268
How many of those do you think will make it...

683
00:46:16.038 --> 00:46:18.608
when I couldn't do it for 10 years? I don't have a guy.

684
00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:20.509
I don't know when I'll get married.

685
00:46:21.179 --> 00:46:23.478
And that's only when you have many eggs...

686
00:46:38.898 --> 00:46:40.299
So my point is...

687
00:46:41.728 --> 00:46:42.799
I envy men.

688
00:46:58.779 --> 00:47:00.518
What's wrong, Do Ah?

689
00:47:04.489 --> 00:47:07.159
Oh no. Did you wake up?

690
00:47:07.159 --> 00:47:08.929
It's okay.

691
00:47:09.188 --> 00:47:11.699
(Galaxy Cafe on the Hills of Montmartre)

692
00:47:28.878 --> 00:47:33.179
Let's get yummies for our Do Ah.

693
00:47:33.319 --> 00:47:34.549
Yummies.

694
00:47:35.088 --> 00:47:36.549
Well...

695
00:47:37.719 --> 00:47:42.188
Yummies for Do Ah's daddy.

696
00:47:42.288 --> 00:47:43.829
For Do Ah's daddy.

697
00:47:49.268 --> 00:47:50.329
Let's go.

698
00:47:51.438 --> 00:47:52.768
Do you live nearby?

699
00:47:52.969 --> 00:47:54.139
I live here.

700
00:47:54.639 --> 00:47:58.438
I didn't think that guy would share an umbrella with you,

701
00:47:58.438 --> 00:48:00.239
so I ran out and bought one.

702
00:48:00.978 --> 00:48:02.108
Let's share.

703
00:48:02.708 --> 00:48:03.808
Is this amusing to you?

704
00:48:05.719 --> 00:48:06.918
You watched on purpose.

705
00:48:11.918 --> 00:48:13.288
Don't be mad.

706
00:48:15.958 --> 00:48:17.228
Don't you know how you apologize?

707
00:48:19.259 --> 00:48:23.228
Why do you always show up during my most humiliating moments?

708
00:48:23.668 --> 00:48:25.699
You're so... Every time...

709
00:48:26.469 --> 00:48:27.608
Don't follow me!

710
00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:32.038
But... I didn't think much of it...

711
00:48:32.139 --> 00:48:33.739
and watched.

712
00:48:34.248 --> 00:48:36.849
I didn't mean to humiliate you. I'm sorry.

713
00:48:37.549 --> 00:48:40.119
Ha Ri. Wait. Ha Ri.

714
00:48:40.478 --> 00:48:41.588
Ha Ri.

715
00:48:43.719 --> 00:48:45.558
What...

716
00:48:45.819 --> 00:48:47.018
Why did that...

717
00:48:47.259 --> 00:48:48.429
My suit...

718
00:48:48.989 --> 00:48:50.088
Oh no.

719
00:48:54.299 --> 00:48:55.369
Ha Ri!

720
00:48:59.312 --> 00:49:00.412
Ha Ri!

721
00:49:01.613 --> 00:49:02.713
What is he doing?

722
00:49:03.082 --> 00:49:04.113
What is it?

723
00:49:07.053 --> 00:49:09.222
- Ha Ri, are you okay? - My suit...

724
00:49:09.323 --> 00:49:11.122
What do you think you're doing?

725
00:49:11.122 --> 00:49:12.923
- Let go of me! - What's wrong with you?

726
00:49:12.923 --> 00:49:14.722
- Where did you come from? - Who are you?

727
00:49:14.722 --> 00:49:15.923
Are you a mugger? A pervert?

728
00:49:15.923 --> 00:49:17.392
What do you do for a living?

729
00:49:17.392 --> 00:49:21.562
How do I look like a pervert or mugger to you?

730
00:49:21.562 --> 00:49:24.332
You're more suspicious because you look normal!

731
00:49:24.733 --> 00:49:28.102
And you shouldn't fall for it just because a guy talks to you.

732
00:49:28.202 --> 00:49:30.202
What... What are you babbling about?

733
00:49:30.202 --> 00:49:32.772
Let go!

734
00:49:34.843 --> 00:49:35.843
Seriously.

735
00:49:44.722 --> 00:49:46.522
- What? - You punk.

736
00:49:50.722 --> 00:49:52.033
This is so embarrassing!

737
00:49:58.702 --> 00:49:59.803
Stop it.

738
00:50:00.573 --> 00:50:02.443
What?

739
00:50:21.662 --> 00:50:23.722
Let go.

740
00:50:25.533 --> 00:50:26.633
Darn it.

741
00:50:33.803 --> 00:50:34.943
Oh no!

742
00:50:35.943 --> 00:50:37.202
Stop it.

743
00:50:37.372 --> 00:50:40.272
Jae Young, stop it already!

744
00:50:40.472 --> 00:50:42.943
- Hey! Let go. - Wait.

745
00:50:43.082 --> 00:50:44.752
Stop it!

746
00:50:45.283 --> 00:50:46.352
Let go!

747
00:50:48.783 --> 00:50:49.923
Stop it!

748
00:50:50.522 --> 00:50:51.693
Let go!

749
00:50:54.193 --> 00:50:55.292
Stop it!

750
00:50:59.363 --> 00:51:00.432
I'm so cold.

751
00:51:09.673 --> 00:51:12.573
Anyway. Sorry about that.

752
00:51:12.943 --> 00:51:15.213
I didn't know you were her colleague.

753
00:51:15.582 --> 00:51:17.042
He isn't my colleague.

754
00:51:17.682 --> 00:51:20.452
Ha Ri and I are like siblings.

755
00:51:20.613 --> 00:51:22.653
And I thought she was in danger.

756
00:51:23.053 --> 00:51:24.082
You punk.

757
00:51:24.122 --> 00:51:26.923
You should get along with your colleague.

758
00:51:26.923 --> 00:51:28.463
Why would you have a fight in the middle of the street?

759
00:51:28.493 --> 00:51:30.022
- We're not colleagues. - We're not colleagues.

760
00:51:33.763 --> 00:51:35.932
What about your blind date?

761
00:51:35.932 --> 00:51:38.073
What were you doing outside...

762
00:51:38.073 --> 00:51:40.073
with your jacket all ripped apart?

763
00:51:41.042 --> 00:51:42.142
Did you get rejected again?

764
00:51:44.272 --> 00:51:46.213
I didn't get rejected.

765
00:51:46.343 --> 00:51:49.213
Do you think I get rejected all the time?

766
00:51:49.243 --> 00:51:50.542
What's your problem?

767
00:51:50.883 --> 00:51:52.553
Watch how you talk to me.

768
00:51:52.912 --> 00:51:54.383
You're so mean.

769
00:51:54.383 --> 00:51:56.752
You should do something about your nasty temper.

770
00:51:57.752 --> 00:51:59.153
I was there.

771
00:51:59.493 --> 00:52:02.392
She didn't get rejected.

772
00:52:02.392 --> 00:52:07.803
I mean, she didn't exactly get rejected by him.

773
00:52:08.363 --> 00:52:10.702
Anyway, they weren't meant for each other.

774
00:52:10.702 --> 00:52:12.733
No one did anything wrong.

775
00:52:15.272 --> 00:52:18.243
Gosh, what's the point of trying so hard?

776
00:52:21.542 --> 00:52:23.783
Love only left me with heartaches...

777
00:52:25.082 --> 00:52:26.883
and hardships.

778
00:52:28.923 --> 00:52:31.693
Go. Just leave.

779
00:52:32.292 --> 00:52:35.062
No! I can't break up with you!

780
00:52:35.062 --> 00:52:36.522
We've done enough!

781
00:52:36.522 --> 00:52:38.292
Why do we need to break up?

782
00:52:38.292 --> 00:52:41.233
Nothing's ever worked out after I met you.

783
00:52:43.062 --> 00:52:44.803
I'm sick of you!

784
00:52:53.573 --> 00:52:57.082
It becomes meaningless once time passes by.

785
00:52:59.483 --> 00:53:01.122
No matter how much you loved each other.

786
00:53:07.522 --> 00:53:08.593
Put it back on.

787
00:53:09.863 --> 00:53:11.792
I'm going to live a happy life.

788
00:53:12.892 --> 00:53:15.102
So don't waste your time hating me.

789
00:53:19.432 --> 00:53:20.602
I hope you become happy, too.

790
00:53:31.113 --> 00:53:34.522
All break-ups are painful and horrible.

791
00:53:35.983 --> 00:53:38.622
It leaves you with a heartache or a broken memory.

792
00:53:38.792 --> 00:53:40.252
Or even both.

793
00:53:41.622 --> 00:53:43.593
It just ruins you.

794
00:53:49.963 --> 00:53:52.573
(Divorce Registration)

795
00:53:56.602 --> 00:53:58.372
I'll take the furniture I bought.

796
00:53:59.272 --> 00:54:00.443
I'll see you in court.

797
00:54:02.443 --> 00:54:04.042
Gosh, that wench.

798
00:54:08.682 --> 00:54:10.153
Yes, you're right.

799
00:54:10.653 --> 00:54:13.823
Drink up. You poor punk.

800
00:54:14.763 --> 00:54:16.292
Drink up.

801
00:54:22.463 --> 00:54:25.403
Judging by the look on our faces,

802
00:54:27.233 --> 00:54:29.002
no one here is in love.

803
00:54:31.772 --> 00:54:34.713
I never once felt happy because of a guy.

804
00:54:36.042 --> 00:54:38.553
So I wonder why I was so obsessed with getting married.

805
00:54:39.582 --> 00:54:42.653
People talk as if I'm too old to get married anyway.

806
00:54:51.863 --> 00:54:54.832
I'd rather be single and happy than become miserable...

807
00:54:56.332 --> 00:54:58.102
just so I could get married.

808
00:55:05.173 --> 00:55:07.073
This is nice.

809
00:55:08.582 --> 00:55:10.113
Here.

810
00:55:11.283 --> 00:55:13.412
(Eun Young)

811
00:55:32.372 --> 00:55:33.432
My gosh.

812
00:55:33.573 --> 00:55:36.502
What took you so long to come? Your deadline was over ages ago.

813
00:55:36.972 --> 00:55:39.613
I thought you were a ghost. What's that on your forehead?

814
00:55:40.243 --> 00:55:42.843
Why are you guys always so clingy?

815
00:55:43.943 --> 00:55:45.053
"You guys"?

816
00:55:46.283 --> 00:55:47.983
Jae Young moved into our place.

817
00:55:48.852 --> 00:55:50.682
My mom let him move in.

818
00:55:51.182 --> 00:55:52.952
"Yoon Jae Young"?

819
00:55:53.292 --> 00:55:55.662
Hey, why would you let that traitor...

820
00:55:55.662 --> 00:55:57.193
move into your place?

821
00:55:57.392 --> 00:55:58.693
What a shameless jerk.

822
00:55:58.693 --> 00:56:01.633
Why would you let him move in with you? Why?

823
00:56:04.803 --> 00:56:07.533
You guys, say hello to Aunt Ha Ri.

824
00:56:08.372 --> 00:56:09.443
Bow!

825
00:56:09.602 --> 00:56:11.243
- Hello. - Hello.

826
00:56:11.843 --> 00:56:15.042
Hey, you cutie pies. Have you been well? Here you go.

827
00:56:19.412 --> 00:56:20.412
Hey!

828
00:56:22.182 --> 00:56:25.892
You should get counseling. Your temper is getting worse.

829
00:56:26.022 --> 00:56:28.562
Hey, take a look at me.

830
00:56:28.562 --> 00:56:29.923
How do you expect me to be sane?

831
00:56:30.093 --> 00:56:32.993
You need to come over and spend time with the kids...

832
00:56:32.993 --> 00:56:36.463
if you want me to stay sane.

833
00:56:40.332 --> 00:56:42.243
What? What's wrong?

834
00:56:44.642 --> 00:56:45.812
Why are they so quiet?

835
00:56:51.383 --> 00:56:54.213
Hey! Get over here!

836
00:56:54.783 --> 00:56:56.053
- Run! - Hey!

837
00:56:56.752 --> 00:56:59.252
Hey! You guys!

838
00:56:59.792 --> 00:57:02.392
I told you not to touch the rice! Open the door!

839
00:57:07.363 --> 00:57:09.363
They really drive me crazy.

840
00:57:10.662 --> 00:57:12.173
I know you can't live without your kids.

841
00:57:12.403 --> 00:57:15.303
Yes, of course. I can live without my husband but not my kids.

842
00:57:18.243 --> 00:57:21.142
But that's only because I'm a mom, but it's better not to have kids.

843
00:57:21.682 --> 00:57:23.943
Hey, don't get married.

844
00:57:25.682 --> 00:57:29.283
It's so tiring to live as a mother.

845
00:57:32.653 --> 00:57:34.022
I mean...

846
00:57:34.452 --> 00:57:37.122
You always meet adorable kids...

847
00:57:37.222 --> 00:57:38.892
and interview moms who are rich.

848
00:57:38.892 --> 00:57:40.792
That's why you think it looks nice to be a mom.

849
00:57:40.892 --> 00:57:43.263
But look around you. Do you envy this?

850
00:57:43.702 --> 00:57:46.432
You'll realize how precious your current life is...

851
00:57:46.573 --> 00:57:48.803
once you don't have time to buy coffee for yourself.

852
00:57:51.843 --> 00:57:53.272
Eun Young, I can't have kids.

853
00:57:59.852 --> 00:58:01.582
How can I have kids when I can't even get married?

854
00:58:06.522 --> 00:58:07.952
My gosh. Hey.

855
00:58:07.952 --> 00:58:09.323
I told you not to run.

856
00:58:41.022 --> 00:58:43.392
This isn't your house. At least ring the bell before you...

857
00:58:43.722 --> 00:58:45.493
- Here. - What's wrong?

858
00:58:50.133 --> 00:58:51.403
Can you sleep with her tonight?

859
00:58:51.832 --> 00:58:54.432
My friend's father passed away, so I need to help at the funeral.

860
00:58:55.743 --> 00:58:57.272
What's wrong with you guys?

861
00:58:58.412 --> 00:59:00.272
Did you do this, Do Ah?

862
00:59:00.272 --> 00:59:01.843
Was it you?

863
00:59:01.843 --> 00:59:03.582
My goodness, really?

864
00:59:04.883 --> 00:59:07.213
You need to sleep now.

865
00:59:07.213 --> 00:59:10.252
It's time for bed, Do Ah. You're burning.

866
00:59:11.122 --> 00:59:12.252
Do Ah.

867
00:59:13.823 --> 00:59:14.993
Do Ah.

868
00:59:15.562 --> 00:59:17.792
Are you okay? Why are you so hot?

869
00:59:18.892 --> 00:59:22.033
What... What do I need to do?

870
00:59:35.042 --> 00:59:36.243
Let me see.

871
00:59:41.153 --> 00:59:42.783
Do Ah!

872
00:59:45.153 --> 00:59:46.392
Do Ah.

873
00:59:53.593 --> 00:59:55.702
Why won't he pick up?

874
00:59:59.403 --> 01:00:00.432
My gosh.

875
01:00:02.673 --> 01:00:04.343
What's wrong?

876
01:00:05.772 --> 01:00:06.972
What's wrong with her?

877
01:00:06.972 --> 01:00:08.173
She has a fever.

878
01:00:08.173 --> 01:00:09.383
- Gosh, she does. - It's okay.

879
01:00:09.483 --> 01:00:11.042
- Should I get a fever reducer? - No, it's okay.

880
01:00:12.452 --> 01:00:15.323
I just need the baby diary. I'll take her to the ER.

881
01:00:15.423 --> 01:00:17.423
Okay. Call me if you need something.

882
01:00:17.423 --> 01:00:19.392
Okay. It's not a big deal. You can go to bed.

883
01:00:19.693 --> 01:00:22.463
My goodness, poor baby. Oh, gosh.

884
01:00:22.693 --> 01:00:25.633
Don't skip your meals, and get good sleep.

885
01:00:26.593 --> 01:00:27.733
Thank you.

886
01:00:28.233 --> 01:00:31.133
You should eat if things aren't awkward between you and Jae Young.

887
01:00:34.073 --> 01:00:35.272
We're good.

888
01:00:35.573 --> 01:00:36.872
It's not because of Jae Young.

889
01:00:36.872 --> 01:00:39.843
I need to go because I have to help Professor Park with his thesis.

890
01:00:40.443 --> 01:00:41.843
You guys don't even keep in touch?

891
01:00:41.912 --> 01:00:43.843
Doesn't she ever call? You guys have a baby together.

892
01:00:48.983 --> 01:00:50.323
Hey. Hello.

893
01:00:51.182 --> 01:00:52.622
Okay, you should go.

894
01:00:57.062 --> 01:00:59.963
She didn't come by to say hello. She's unbelievable.

895
01:01:00.662 --> 01:01:03.832
But I guess that's how she became an assistant professor so quickly.

896
01:01:05.303 --> 01:01:06.432
Good for her.

(Crazy Ha Ri)

898
01:01:13.113 --> 01:01:14.243
She has bronchitis.

899
01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:17.243
You should know that as her mom.

900
01:01:17.613 --> 01:01:19.653
Actually, I'm not her mom.

901
01:01:20.713 --> 01:01:22.122
Her father...

902
01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:27.392
He's getting drunk somewhere and isn't picking up my calls.

903
01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:28.562
That piece of garbage.

904
01:01:30.423 --> 01:01:33.562
So you're babysitting the daughter of a piece of garbage.

905
01:01:35.662 --> 01:01:37.363
I'll prescribe three days' worth of medicine,

906
01:01:37.363 --> 01:01:38.472
so make sure she takes it all.

907
01:01:38.573 --> 01:01:41.033
If she vomits in her sleep, it could block her airway,

908
01:01:41.033 --> 01:01:42.743
- so have her sleep on her side. - Sure.

909
01:01:42.843 --> 01:01:44.042
Gosh, thank you.

910
01:01:50.812 --> 01:01:53.713
Do you have any idea how scared I was?

911
01:03:00.082 --> 01:03:03.622
Look at you all better and playing on your own.

912
01:03:09.562 --> 01:03:11.733
I'm sure the fever was no joke,

913
01:03:11.733 --> 01:03:13.963
but you did good. How sweet of you.

914
01:03:16.102 --> 01:03:18.903
My gosh. Did you just smile at me?

915
01:03:19.633 --> 01:03:22.142
You're laughing after scaring me like that last night?

916
01:03:23.903 --> 01:03:26.372
I'm not cut out for this at all.

917
01:03:27.573 --> 01:03:30.682
How on earth would I raise such a pain in the neck?

918
01:03:46.332 --> 01:03:47.493
It'll be all right.

919
01:03:50.062 --> 01:03:52.602
There's nothing you can do when something you want...

920
01:03:53.472 --> 01:03:54.972
will just never happen.

921
01:03:56.272 --> 01:03:57.372
Right?

922
01:05:07.912 --> 01:05:09.812
- The latest issue is out. - Right.

923
01:05:12.713 --> 01:05:13.852
Thanks.

926
01:06:01.593 --> 01:06:04.233
Did you finally choose to have the surgery?

927
01:06:05.272 --> 01:06:07.932
The surgery could lead to infertility, right?

928
01:06:08.272 --> 01:06:09.702
There's a high possibility.

929
01:06:11.743 --> 01:06:13.843
I'll have a baby first and then do the surgery.

930
01:06:15.883 --> 01:06:16.983
Are you getting married?

931
01:06:18.383 --> 01:06:20.553
I could get married at 50 or 60 if I want,

932
01:06:20.812 --> 01:06:22.823
but this is my last chance to get pregnant.

933
01:06:29.093 --> 01:06:30.222
I'm not getting married.

934
01:06:31.193 --> 01:06:32.493
I just want to have a baby.

Marriage? I'd love for fate to bring someone to me,

938
01:07:05.163 --> 01:07:08.092
but my reality is, I'm being called an old lady.

939
01:07:08.092 --> 01:07:10.003
You've never been good at dating.

940
01:07:10.102 --> 01:07:11.503
Zip it...

941
01:07:11.503 --> 01:07:13.503
or you'll taste my foot in your mouth.

942
01:07:13.503 --> 01:07:15.802
Ms. Jang, are you still embarrassed to see me?

943
01:07:15.903 --> 01:07:17.573
No, I couldn't be more comfortable.

944
01:07:17.573 --> 01:07:19.873
Eu Ddeum, no aunt of yours works here.

945
01:07:19.873 --> 01:07:22.743
How about a little practice round by helping us out?

946
01:07:23.243 --> 01:07:25.243
- Do you want me? - Can I have you if I do?

947
01:07:25.243 --> 01:07:26.812
Don't hate me so much.

948
01:07:27.413 --> 01:07:30.722
It's harder to hate someone than to like someone.
