00:00:44.392 --> 00:00:45.732
I...

2
00:00:47.492 --> 00:00:51.402
want nothing more than to love you.

3
00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:57.202
But...

4
00:01:01.612 --> 00:01:04.682
it's difficult for me to have a child.

5
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:23.762
I didn't know how to tell you this...

6
00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:26.701
because I was worried...

7
00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:29.402
that you might leave me because of this...

8
00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:31.542
or look at me like that.

9
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:34.642
But I guess it doesn't matter how I tell you.

10
00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:37.642
I know you're shocked by this.

11
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:39.451
But let's...

12
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:41.012
- try... - No.

13
00:01:42.951 --> 00:01:44.481
No, wait.

14
00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:45.692
Wait. No, Ha Ri...

15
00:01:45.692 --> 00:01:46.822
Ha Ri.

16
00:01:47.852 --> 00:01:48.921
Wait.

00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:12.141
(How Much I Love You and How Sorry I Am)

19
00:03:24.021 --> 00:03:25.421
Where were you?

20
00:03:25.521 --> 00:03:27.352
Mr. Kim has been waiting for you.

21
00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:31.262
Something came up. Let's go inside.

22
00:03:35.162 --> 00:03:37.201
The companies that renewed their advertisement contracts...

23
00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:38.801
We already talked about that yesterday.

24
00:03:39.372 --> 00:03:42.102
I wanted to have a meeting regarding the cover.

25
00:03:42.301 --> 00:03:45.211
Is next month's cover going to be a baby as well?

26
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:47.271
Who did you cast?

27
00:03:47.271 --> 00:03:49.711
Leila, the baby who shot for the fashion section last month.

28
00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:52.981
Can we please cast a celebrity?

29
00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:57.722
Are we going to do a sponsored photo shoot?

30
00:03:58.252 --> 00:03:59.391
Must we do that?

31
00:03:59.852 --> 00:04:02.592
Only few advertisers are willing to do that.

32
00:04:03.622 --> 00:04:04.991
Casting budget isn't enough.

33
00:04:06.762 --> 00:04:08.801
Ms. Jang, do you know any celebrities personally?

34
00:04:13.472 --> 00:04:14.532
Ms. Jang.

35
00:04:15.771 --> 00:04:16.771
Ms. Jang.

36
00:04:17.641 --> 00:04:18.711
Yes?

37
00:04:19.671 --> 00:04:22.012
Our competitor, "Eco and Babe",

38
00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.641
is going to have Lee Mi Do...

39
00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:25.752
and her baby on their cover next month.

40
00:04:25.752 --> 00:04:28.352
Really? How did they cast them?

41
00:04:29.222 --> 00:04:32.491
Ms. Jang, we should also cast a top celebrity.

42
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:37.361
Ms. Jang, every time I meet advertisers,

43
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.831
they compare us with our competitor.

44
00:04:39.831 --> 00:04:42.301
Not only does it hurt my pride,

45
00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:44.901
but we always end up losing our advertisements.

46
00:04:45.972 --> 00:04:47.931
Okay, fine. Sure.

47
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:51.302
- Really? - Yes.

48
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:58.982
- Any parcels for "The Baby"? - Just a second.

49
00:05:11.362 --> 00:05:12.831
Thank you.

50
00:05:20.072 --> 00:05:21.132
Hello.

51
00:05:25.372 --> 00:05:27.541
Don't you have anything to say to me?

52
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:34.351
I mean...

53
00:05:35.622 --> 00:05:36.822
Well...

54
00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:43.891
They are too heavy.

55
00:05:54.872 --> 00:05:56.341
Why did you do that?

56
00:05:56.942 --> 00:05:58.211
What?

57
00:05:58.841 --> 00:06:02.141
Did something happen during the weekend?

58
00:06:05.081 --> 00:06:06.211
Yes.

59
00:06:29.172 --> 00:06:30.502
Why aren't you coming?

60
00:06:47.021 --> 00:06:48.322
No way.

61
00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:50.961
Is she the person you wanted to ask out?

62
00:07:20.021 --> 00:07:22.291
Eu Ddeum, please organize this.

63
00:08:14.512 --> 00:08:15.812
How is Do Ah?

64
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:18.242
She took medicine, so she'll be fine.

65
00:08:28.461 --> 00:08:30.692
She really should clean this up.

66
00:08:30.692 --> 00:08:32.562
She'll get hurt on her way down.

67
00:08:40.502 --> 00:08:42.771
You should go upstairs. I think she came home.

68
00:08:46.141 --> 00:08:47.841
I have nothing to say to her.

69
00:08:52.012 --> 00:08:54.081
Why? Can't you even look at her?

70
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:00.391
I'm scared I might confess my feelings.

71
00:09:00.922 --> 00:09:02.362
Then it'll end our relationship.

72
00:09:06.832 --> 00:09:09.061
I totally approve of you.

73
00:09:10.102 --> 00:09:13.132
It's too bad that Ha Ri doesn't feel the same way.

74
00:09:17.141 --> 00:09:19.311
Why do you approve of me being with her though?

75
00:09:19.811 --> 00:09:21.271
I'm a divorced single father.

76
00:09:21.612 --> 00:09:23.342
I'm a divorced single mother too.

77
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:30.821
To Ha Ri, you were like...

78
00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:32.952
a father and a brother.

79
00:09:34.252 --> 00:09:35.992
I felt bad that she was always alone,

80
00:09:36.362 --> 00:09:39.061
so I was glad to know that she at least had you.

81
00:09:39.632 --> 00:09:42.531
It's why I depended on you too.

82
00:09:46.472 --> 00:09:49.202
Decades ago, your mom and I...

83
00:09:50.071 --> 00:09:52.171
promised to have our kids marry each other,

84
00:09:52.472 --> 00:09:54.472
but you went chasing after another girl.

85
00:09:59.982 --> 00:10:02.821
The man Ha Ri's seeing...

86
00:10:03.622 --> 00:10:06.252
Is he the one she went to Mureung with?

87
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:09.921
Yes.

88
00:10:10.122 --> 00:10:11.931
Is he not up to par?

89
00:10:12.691 --> 00:10:13.791
Won't it work out?

90
00:10:16.161 --> 00:10:17.962
Are you waiting because they'll break up?

91
00:10:25.311 --> 00:10:27.612
Truth be told, I don't want her to be with anyone.

92
00:10:30.512 --> 00:10:34.352
But what can I do when he's the one...

93
00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:38.051
Ha Ri truly wants?

94
00:10:39.752 --> 00:10:40.921
I should give up.

95
00:10:46.061 --> 00:10:47.061
Gosh.

96
00:10:49.002 --> 00:10:50.632
Goodness, Do Ah.

97
00:11:04.612 --> 00:11:06.582
So did you two break up?

98
00:11:07.112 --> 00:11:08.212
Is that it?

99
00:11:09.722 --> 00:11:12.891
Are we supposed to do this until your heart heals from the pain?

100
00:11:13.791 --> 00:11:14.891
Is that it?

101
00:11:16.222 --> 00:11:17.391
We won't break up.

102
00:11:18.222 --> 00:11:19.291
Then tell me.

103
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:24.862
Why did you make me come here at this hour...

104
00:11:24.862 --> 00:11:26.771
when you and Ms. Jang are still solid?

105
00:11:31.801 --> 00:11:32.872
What the...

106
00:11:34.911 --> 00:11:36.541
- Darn it. - I'm infertile.

107
00:11:41.452 --> 00:11:43.921
- What? - Why did I find it hard to say...

108
00:11:44.482 --> 00:11:45.592
when it's this easy?

109
00:11:47.592 --> 00:11:48.622
You?

110
00:11:49.691 --> 00:11:51.592
You and not Ms. Jang?

111
00:11:53.291 --> 00:11:56.362
I Sang, is that why you and In Ah broke up?

112
00:11:56.762 --> 00:11:59.502
So? Does Ms. Jang want to end things too?

113
00:12:05.071 --> 00:12:06.842
It only had to be hard for me,

114
00:12:07.911 --> 00:12:09.012
but now...

115
00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:19.391
Soo Chul.

116
00:12:20.992 --> 00:12:22.421
There's somewhere I need to go.

117
00:12:23.191 --> 00:12:24.291
Go ahead without me.

118
00:13:57.072 --> 00:13:58.213
I'm sorry.

119
00:14:00.812 --> 00:14:01.912
I'm truly sorry.

120
00:14:03.583 --> 00:14:04.682
What I did...

121
00:14:07.083 --> 00:14:08.253
was wrong.

122
00:14:12.052 --> 00:14:13.123
I just...

123
00:14:14.662 --> 00:14:15.932
wanted to tell you that.

124
00:14:21.633 --> 00:14:23.072
Tell me...

125
00:14:24.003 --> 00:14:25.103
the rest of your story.

126
00:14:43.853 --> 00:14:45.152
Before the wedding,

127
00:14:48.393 --> 00:14:50.093
I got myself tested.

128
00:14:53.562 --> 00:14:54.932
I didn't show any symptoms...

129
00:14:56.702 --> 00:14:58.302
and everything seemed normal,

130
00:15:01.473 --> 00:15:04.013
so I didn't think there would be an issue.

131
00:15:07.343 --> 00:15:11.182
But we found out that I had a fertility issue.

132
00:15:12.083 --> 00:15:14.123
We thought that I'd get better...

133
00:15:14.822 --> 00:15:17.253
after three months of treatment,

134
00:15:19.593 --> 00:15:20.893
but only a painful breakup...

135
00:15:23.032 --> 00:15:24.093
awaited us.

136
00:15:28.532 --> 00:15:29.603
My heart...

137
00:15:31.973 --> 00:15:33.343
went through...

138
00:15:34.702 --> 00:15:36.113
the most painful time...

139
00:15:37.772 --> 00:15:39.442
moving on from that breakup...

140
00:15:42.753 --> 00:15:44.013
that I didn't want...

141
00:15:47.422 --> 00:15:50.952
to get involved with you because it could lead to a similar outcome.

142
00:15:55.522 --> 00:15:56.662
However,

143
00:16:00.302 --> 00:16:01.963
I fell for you,

144
00:16:03.572 --> 00:16:04.733
and I knew...

145
00:16:07.572 --> 00:16:08.843
that my condition...

146
00:16:11.312 --> 00:16:12.782
would hurt you more...

147
00:16:17.182 --> 00:16:18.312
which is what...

148
00:16:20.452 --> 00:16:21.822
worried me the most.

149
00:16:26.723 --> 00:16:27.922
You also...

150
00:16:31.263 --> 00:16:34.503
experienced your world ending in front of your eyes.

151
00:16:41.502 --> 00:16:44.873
Still, if you didn't want to hurt me...

152
00:16:46.343 --> 00:16:47.843
and if you cared about me,

153
00:16:50.383 --> 00:16:52.182
you should've told me sooner.

154
00:16:57.492 --> 00:16:59.962
Accepting my own fate was hard enough.

155
00:17:06.702 --> 00:17:07.803
I should go.

156
00:17:51.543 --> 00:17:53.742
She never bothered to drink these,

157
00:17:54.212 --> 00:17:56.383
but I see that she has been this time.

158
00:18:24.543 --> 00:18:26.813
Okay, take a deep breath.

159
00:18:27.182 --> 00:18:28.343
And exhale.

160
00:18:28.543 --> 00:18:29.712
All done.

161
00:18:30.652 --> 00:18:32.952
The pneumonia is lasting longer than I expected.

162
00:18:33.283 --> 00:18:34.452
That's bad, isn't it?

163
00:18:34.452 --> 00:18:37.492
It'll get better once we treat it, so don't worry.

164
00:18:37.952 --> 00:18:39.863
Are you having fun? Here.

165
00:18:40.262 --> 00:18:43.363
I'll buy you ice cream once you're all better. I promise.

166
00:18:46.563 --> 00:18:48.502
- You're free to go. - Thank you.

167
00:18:49.502 --> 00:18:50.873
Doctor.

168
00:18:51.432 --> 00:18:54.043
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

169
00:19:21.502 --> 00:19:23.472
What do luxurious baby panties...

170
00:19:23.472 --> 00:19:26.202
and elegant bloomers look like?

171
00:19:26.303 --> 00:19:28.873
They look luxurious and elegant.

172
00:19:29.273 --> 00:19:32.172
Hyo Joo. Can you not write an article...

173
00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:33.583
without using slang?

174
00:19:33.982 --> 00:19:36.883
- Rewrite it without slang. - Yes, ma'am.

175
00:19:40.752 --> 00:19:43.222
- What? - The baby model can't make it...

176
00:19:43.523 --> 00:19:45.692
for the toy ad. They called and notified us.

177
00:19:45.893 --> 00:19:47.793
Please bring your friend's baby.

178
00:19:48.593 --> 00:19:51.262
You sound so arrogant, I feel like I owe you.

179
00:19:51.762 --> 00:19:52.803
Fine.

(List of ovulation-inducing agents)

182
00:20:14.353 --> 00:20:16.053
- Yeon Ho. - Yes?

183
00:20:16.793 --> 00:20:19.053
Do men get injections of ovulation agents too?

184
00:20:19.462 --> 00:20:22.863
Yes. They use that to treat male infertility too.

185
00:20:22.863 --> 00:20:24.492
I hear men have to get it...

186
00:20:24.492 --> 00:20:26.502
2 to 3 times a week for 3 months straight.

187
00:20:28.202 --> 00:20:32.103
I knew it was hard on women, but it must be hard on men too.

188
00:20:54.992 --> 00:20:56.063
What?

189
00:20:56.662 --> 00:20:59.502
I'm really going to change jobs this time.

190
00:21:00.732 --> 00:21:03.232
You said you were really going to change jobs last time too.

191
00:21:03.533 --> 00:21:07.103
You're not a pathological liar, are you?

192
00:21:07.103 --> 00:21:09.143
You brat. I mean it.

193
00:21:12.712 --> 00:21:14.712
I have no reason to stay here anymore.

194
00:21:15.113 --> 00:21:18.353
But one year doesn't even count as experience, right?

195
00:21:18.353 --> 00:21:20.823
Is it better to switch jobs after 1 to 2 years,

196
00:21:20.823 --> 00:21:21.883
or...

197
00:21:21.952 --> 00:21:24.922
is it better to find a new job as quickly as possible?

198
00:21:25.353 --> 00:21:28.162
If you get hired for the job you want, you take it. Period.

199
00:21:30.293 --> 00:21:32.762
This was the job I wanted.

200
00:21:35.232 --> 00:21:36.502
Oh my gosh.

201
00:21:39.672 --> 00:21:43.343
Why are you whispering instead of doing your work?

202
00:21:44.442 --> 00:21:45.573
Include me too.

203
00:21:48.583 --> 00:21:50.752
Competitors keep shutting down,

204
00:21:51.083 --> 00:21:53.652
so people keep calling to ask if we'll have an issue next month.

205
00:21:53.682 --> 00:21:56.152
I guess I should find a new job.

206
00:21:57.853 --> 00:21:59.462
I feel your pain.

207
00:22:00.422 --> 00:22:03.633
They say that every year. I'm sure it's just a rumor.

208
00:22:03.762 --> 00:22:06.202
I don't think it is, that's why.

209
00:22:35.023 --> 00:22:36.492
Why are you...

210
00:22:39.833 --> 00:22:41.133
What are you doing here...

211
00:22:43.873 --> 00:22:46.002
It's working hours.

212
00:22:48.672 --> 00:22:49.773
So?

213
00:23:04.023 --> 00:23:05.123
Are you hurt?

214
00:23:06.722 --> 00:23:08.162
Why do you care?

215
00:23:08.523 --> 00:23:10.893
What's it to you even if I break my wrist?

216
00:23:13.333 --> 00:23:14.462
Because I know you personally.

217
00:23:21.702 --> 00:23:25.012
Do you care about and take care of everyone woman you know?

218
00:23:25.543 --> 00:23:28.742
You're a real jerk, you know that?

219
00:23:30.652 --> 00:23:33.383
I know I may be a bit dumb, but I'm not a bad person.

220
00:23:33.383 --> 00:23:34.652
Listen.

221
00:23:35.283 --> 00:23:37.192
You don't know you're bad, right?

222
00:23:37.893 --> 00:23:39.293
That's even worse.

223
00:23:43.533 --> 00:23:45.063
Why are you being like this to me?

224
00:23:45.492 --> 00:23:47.103
Why am I a bad person?

225
00:23:47.633 --> 00:23:50.672
What bad things did I do to you? I don't understand.

226
00:23:54.873 --> 00:23:56.442
Why are you considerate?

227
00:23:58.512 --> 00:24:00.843
Why did you run to the store to buy me bandage,

228
00:24:01.442 --> 00:24:02.813
smile at me,

229
00:24:03.912 --> 00:24:05.682
and make me get the wrong idea?

230
00:24:09.083 --> 00:24:11.053
I'm so humiliated.

231
00:24:19.293 --> 00:24:21.962
- Why are you crying? - I'm not crying.

232
00:24:27.843 --> 00:24:30.012
Why is this running?

233
00:24:30.113 --> 00:24:32.813
This was supposed to be waterproof.

234
00:24:32.813 --> 00:24:34.543
Are you crying because your mascara ran?

235
00:24:34.883 --> 00:24:37.512
I'll buy you a better one, so don't cry.

236
00:24:37.512 --> 00:24:38.783
Hey!

237
00:24:38.783 --> 00:24:41.523
Stop that, will you?

238
00:24:41.853 --> 00:24:45.222
Don't be so nice to me.

239
00:24:50.932 --> 00:24:52.932
Do you sell mascara here?

240
00:25:12.452 --> 00:25:15.853
Are you unable to go in because of me?

241
00:25:44.512 --> 00:25:45.783
A test shot.

242
00:25:47.283 --> 00:25:49.152
We'll use a small picture as an image cut.

243
00:26:02.633 --> 00:26:03.702
Like this?

244
00:26:04.002 --> 00:26:05.402
That's good. Yes.

245
00:26:10.543 --> 00:26:13.242
- I'll help you. - No, I'll do it.

246
00:26:27.563 --> 00:26:28.762
I said...

247
00:26:30.033 --> 00:26:31.863
I was afraid of hurting you, right?

248
00:26:33.603 --> 00:26:35.762
So I won't.

249
00:26:37.333 --> 00:26:40.873
Let's find a way together.

250
00:26:42.472 --> 00:26:46.073
I'll do everything I can,

251
00:26:46.543 --> 00:26:49.442
- so... - You said it was unbearably hard.

252
00:26:51.682 --> 00:26:53.623
You said it came to a painful end.

253
00:27:00.393 --> 00:27:02.492
You said love is like a miracle.

254
00:27:03.732 --> 00:27:06.502
You said you never let go of the people you love.

255
00:27:06.962 --> 00:27:09.202
That's the solution I'm thinking of.

256
00:27:14.773 --> 00:27:17.442
It'll kill you inside because you can't give it to me.

257
00:27:19.242 --> 00:27:21.543
And it'll kill me inside because I can't be hopeful.

258
00:27:23.182 --> 00:27:26.383
We'd be perfectly fine if we didn't want kids.

259
00:27:28.482 --> 00:27:30.023
If it weren't for me,

260
00:27:30.853 --> 00:27:33.523
you wouldn't have to suffer this pain.

261
00:27:33.563 --> 00:27:35.262
Don't say that, Ha Ri.

262
00:27:37.633 --> 00:27:39.462
Maybe we never should've started to begin with.

263
00:28:03.692 --> 00:28:05.593
- Did you go to Art Department? - Yes.

264
00:28:07.123 --> 00:28:08.123
Where's Ms. Jang?

265
00:28:08.422 --> 00:28:10.932
- Did she go somewhere? - Yes.

266
00:28:11.432 --> 00:28:15.133
By the way, Hyo Joo disappeared.

267
00:28:16.002 --> 00:28:17.073
She disappeared?

268
00:28:17.603 --> 00:28:20.073
Her bag is still here, but she was gone all day,

269
00:28:20.073 --> 00:28:21.343
and I can't even reach her.

270
00:28:21.643 --> 00:28:24.742
Do you think she drank during working hours again?

271
00:28:24.912 --> 00:28:26.783
- No! - Gosh, you startled me.

272
00:28:28.712 --> 00:28:31.012
She helped me organize the storage room today.

273
00:28:32.012 --> 00:28:33.523
- Oh, okay. - I see.

274
00:28:39.222 --> 00:28:40.323
Bye!

275
00:28:40.323 --> 00:28:42.192
- Bye. - See you.

276
00:28:51.103 --> 00:28:52.232
My gosh!

277
00:28:56.512 --> 00:28:59.212
Gosh, I'm dying.

278
00:29:10.692 --> 00:29:14.293
Ms... Ms. Choi.

279
00:29:14.293 --> 00:29:17.033
- My gosh. - Ms. Choi.

280
00:29:17.033 --> 00:29:18.962
You need to wake up. It's time to go home.

281
00:29:19.063 --> 00:29:22.063
- You'll catch a cold. - Cut the nonsense.

282
00:29:22.063 --> 00:29:23.573
I won't catch anything.

283
00:29:23.573 --> 00:29:27.103
My gosh, I want to have just one more shot.

284
00:29:30.412 --> 00:29:31.472
Where am I?

285
00:29:32.412 --> 00:29:33.643
Gosh, I'm so tired.

286
00:29:34.383 --> 00:29:35.412
My gosh.

287
00:29:35.412 --> 00:29:36.783
Gosh, let me down.

288
00:29:38.212 --> 00:29:40.083
Will you help me?

289
00:29:40.182 --> 00:29:42.083
- My gosh. - No, wait.

290
00:29:43.692 --> 00:29:45.623
Let's have one more drink.

291
00:29:47.422 --> 00:29:49.893
You have arrived at your destination.

292
00:29:49.893 --> 00:29:51.563
The GPS ends here.

293
00:29:52.033 --> 00:29:54.363
Ms. Choi. Ms. Choi.

294
00:29:54.863 --> 00:29:56.902
I followed the GPS. Is this where you live?

295
00:29:57.073 --> 00:29:59.902
My gosh, lower the volume.

296
00:30:00.202 --> 00:30:01.773
Gosh, it's so loud.

297
00:30:01.773 --> 00:30:03.942
Lower the GPS volume.

298
00:30:04.672 --> 00:30:07.012
What's your building and unit number?

299
00:30:07.113 --> 00:30:09.212
If you tell me the passcode, I'll take you home.

300
00:30:11.452 --> 00:30:14.883
How dare you try to enter my house?

301
00:30:16.523 --> 00:30:18.793
This is where I live.

302
00:30:22.863 --> 00:30:23.962
What should I do?

303
00:30:31.172 --> 00:30:33.702
Her address is in Busan.

304
00:30:35.873 --> 00:30:37.972
I think she forgot to register her new address.

305
00:30:41.043 --> 00:30:43.952
Then is it okay if we stay here...

306
00:30:44.053 --> 00:30:45.583
until tomorrow morning?

307
00:30:46.722 --> 00:30:48.752
- Sure. - Thank you.

308
00:30:50.823 --> 00:30:51.992
Thank goodness.

309
00:30:55.962 --> 00:30:57.593
She should stay warm while she sleeps.

310
00:31:30.333 --> 00:31:31.393
What do you want?

311
00:31:36.033 --> 00:31:37.603
Do Ah's fast asleep.

312
00:31:37.932 --> 00:31:39.942
Your mom offered to keep an eye on her.

313
00:31:40.643 --> 00:31:43.343
There's this drama I watch.

314
00:31:43.442 --> 00:31:45.143
But your mom is watching something else.

315
00:31:54.952 --> 00:31:56.083
Is there something wrong?

316
00:31:56.623 --> 00:31:58.023
What's with that look on your face?

317
00:31:59.323 --> 00:32:00.623
Aren't you here to watch a drama?

318
00:32:00.722 --> 00:32:01.962
If not, just leave.

319
00:32:06.162 --> 00:32:08.502
It hasn't even been that long, and you're already so sad.

320
00:32:09.232 --> 00:32:10.972
I knew you'd be like this.

321
00:32:11.103 --> 00:32:13.073
Just don't date anyone if you can't handle it.

322
00:32:13.073 --> 00:32:14.343
You know nothing.

323
00:32:15.843 --> 00:32:18.273
How could you have known when I didn't even see it coming?

324
00:32:19.012 --> 00:32:22.283
How many people do you think open up about everything...

325
00:32:22.283 --> 00:32:24.383
and still date each other because they're so in love?

326
00:32:24.482 --> 00:32:25.553
Do people like that even exist?

327
00:32:26.252 --> 00:32:29.553
Who dates someone knowing that they'll get hurt?

328
00:32:47.202 --> 00:32:48.603
Gosh, that brat.

329
00:33:03.222 --> 00:33:04.652
(Sperm King)

330
00:33:08.762 --> 00:33:11.063
Eu Ddeum, do you know Han I Sang's number?

331
00:33:17.033 --> 00:33:18.103
Come in.

332
00:33:40.331 --> 00:33:43.701
I guess you really like showing off.

333
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:45.431
You live alone.

334
00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:46.840
Your house is huge.

335
00:33:48.471 --> 00:33:50.141
I'm sure you're not here to take a tour of my house.

336
00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.071
Have a seat. Would you like some tea?

337
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:55.710
If you have a lot to say, I'll bring alcohol.

338
00:33:55.781 --> 00:33:58.781
It's not something to say over a nice cup of tea.

339
00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.551
And let's not drink because I might hit you.

340
00:34:04.851 --> 00:34:06.590
Then let's just talk like this.

341
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:08.621
Sure.

342
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:11.360
I want to know...

343
00:34:12.331 --> 00:34:14.060
what happened between you guys.

344
00:34:16.701 --> 00:34:19.331
If you're going to break up with her, just hurry up.

345
00:34:19.531 --> 00:34:22.801
You know she's in a hurry, so don't waste her time and opportunity.

346
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.040
She already has a lot on her mind.

347
00:34:26.911 --> 00:34:29.081
Let's not make it worse and make her suffer emotionally.

348
00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.351
Ha Ri finally managed to find someone she likes.

349
00:34:38.721 --> 00:34:40.090
Can't you just support us?

350
00:34:40.321 --> 00:34:42.360
I would've been still worried even if she was on cloud nine.

351
00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:45.491
But she's hurting with a big frown on her face.

352
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.230
So how do you expect me to support you?

353
00:34:50.531 --> 00:34:53.871
I'm okay if she breaks up with the guy who isn't right for her.

354
00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.641
So I'm going to keep interfering with your relationship.

355
00:34:57.411 --> 00:34:59.110
Will you be able to handle me for the rest of your life?

356
00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.110
I'll just think of you as something that comes along with her.

357
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:09.621
I'm saying I'm going to stop you.

358
00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.790
I don't really like you.

359
00:35:17.931 --> 00:35:19.161
I didn't like you from the start.

360
00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:21.801
It looks like something went wrong as soon as you started dating.

361
00:35:21.801 --> 00:35:24.871
And someone needs to disapprove in order to make you reconsider.

362
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.101
So I'm going to be the mean mother-in-law.

363
00:35:34.210 --> 00:35:35.810
As a friend or a man?

364
00:35:37.911 --> 00:35:41.621
I can only deal with you when we're both equal as men.

365
00:35:42.551 --> 00:35:44.690
You need to choose what you want to be.

366
00:35:44.991 --> 00:35:47.560
Right now, you're neither her friend...

367
00:35:48.321 --> 00:35:49.690
nor a man to her.

368
00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.161
Okay.

369
00:35:53.661 --> 00:35:56.460
Let's wait and see how things turn out for you.

370
00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:00.040
Sure. You can sit back and watch...

371
00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.601
what I eventually become.

372
00:37:14.141 --> 00:37:15.141
You're up.

373
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:16.710
I am.

374
00:37:41.201 --> 00:37:42.241
Oh my...

375
00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:44.340
Hello, ma'am.

376
00:37:44.471 --> 00:37:48.141
Mr. Han, what are you doing here?

377
00:37:51.011 --> 00:37:53.420
I'm waiting for my girlfriend.

378
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:54.951
Your girlfriend?

379
00:37:56.351 --> 00:37:58.821
Well, it's just my daughter and I...

380
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.860
who live here...

381
00:38:05.331 --> 00:38:06.960
Are you Ha Ri's mother?

382
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:09.331
The minx that stole you away...

383
00:38:09.331 --> 00:38:10.770
is my Ha Ri?

384
00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.440
My gosh. Hello, my son-in-law!

385
00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:17.840
My goodness. You're got to be kidding me.

386
00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.911
Unbelievable.

387
00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.110
Auntie?

388
00:38:28.581 --> 00:38:29.681
Do you know him?

389
00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.020
You two seem chummy for some reason...

390
00:38:34.261 --> 00:38:36.020
with all the hand-holding.

391
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:38.690
Well,

392
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:43.161
we're not exactly friends. It's...

393
00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:45.101
We learn leather crafting together.

394
00:38:45.201 --> 00:38:46.270
"We"?

395
00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:48.071
Together?

396
00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:52.210
I meant that we take the same classes.

397
00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:53.681
We don't actually go there together.

398
00:38:59.210 --> 00:39:02.281
It's true. We're not close in any way.

399
00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:08.391
Didn't you call me your son-in-law just now?

400
00:39:09.121 --> 00:39:10.130
What?

401
00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:12.230
Son-in-law?

402
00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:13.761
What?

403
00:39:16.931 --> 00:39:19.871
Anyway, Ha Ri went to the office early,

404
00:39:19.871 --> 00:39:22.270
so you should head to work too.

405
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.670
You should also...

406
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.810
drop Do Ah off and head to your clinic.

407
00:39:27.081 --> 00:39:30.011
I have an aerobics class to get to, so bye.

408
00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:46.790
Ha Ri's mother called me her son-in-law earlier.

409
00:39:49.261 --> 00:39:51.931
- Forget it. - She approved of me...

410
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:54.201
a long time ago.

411
00:39:54.571 --> 00:39:55.871
We should head to work.

412
00:39:56.141 --> 00:39:57.940
That's exactly what I'm doing.

413
00:40:25.571 --> 00:40:26.670
It's Jeon Tae Hui.

414
00:40:27.770 --> 00:40:29.071
I've never seen a celebrity before.

415
00:40:29.071 --> 00:40:32.071
Me neither. How can she look that great in purple?

416
00:40:32.471 --> 00:40:34.480
- Out of all the women I've seen... - She's pretty.

417
00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.650
Is she really?

418
00:40:39.181 --> 00:40:41.150
I guess she is and purple suits her.

419
00:40:41.281 --> 00:40:43.650
That means I can never wear purple myself. Enjoy mine too.

420
00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:45.190
Have a good day.

421
00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.460
Jeon Tae Hui!

422
00:40:54.661 --> 00:40:56.331
- Ms. Jang. - My gosh!

423
00:40:56.331 --> 00:40:59.801
- Ms. Jang! - Jeon Tae Hui is at the studio.

424
00:40:59.801 --> 00:41:02.670
She's shooting the cover of "Bo SHOW" with Mr. Han.

425
00:41:02.871 --> 00:41:05.040
Here. Look at this!

426
00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:08.141
Jeon Tae Hui and Mr. Han must be tight.

427
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.781
I think he's someone we should've respected more.

428
00:41:13.551 --> 00:41:15.551
Rather than shooting it at their studio,

429
00:41:15.551 --> 00:41:17.551
"Bo SHOW" let Mr. Han take the photos instead.

430
00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:19.621
It means it was requested by Jeon Tae Hui.

431
00:41:21.491 --> 00:41:22.721
My gosh!

432
00:41:22.721 --> 00:41:25.031
I once called him an idiot for shooting...

433
00:41:25.031 --> 00:41:26.900
the breast pump upside down.

434
00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.500
It must've been intended,

435
00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:31.500
but I didn't know any better.

436
00:41:31.571 --> 00:41:33.230
How stupid of me.

437
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:34.670
I can't believe you said that.

438
00:41:34.801 --> 00:41:36.801
I'm sure it's all right though.

439
00:41:37.110 --> 00:41:39.241
What if I got on his bad side?

440
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:41.181
- It happens. - This is killing me.

441
00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:43.710
- What do I do? - How can he know Jeon Tae Hui?

442
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:45.781
- My gosh. - I can't believe it.

443
00:41:46.451 --> 00:41:47.650
Gosh!

444
00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.551
- Let's go. - Hold on.

445
00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:51.451
Do you have a photo shoot today?

446
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:56.460
I can't believe she's here when I look like a mess.

447
00:42:03.431 --> 00:42:06.101
Ms. Jang, you should get over there.

448
00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:09.540
- Why? - To book Jeon Tae Hui.

449
00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.110
Me?

450
00:42:12.911 --> 00:42:15.511
Good. That's great.

451
00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.681
All right. That looks amazing.

452
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:22.081
Exactly. That's it.

453
00:42:22.621 --> 00:42:23.690
Good.

454
00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:28.060
Even I would look that good once dolled up by professionals.

455
00:42:28.761 --> 00:42:30.531
A reincarnation would be faster.

456
00:42:30.931 --> 00:42:33.031
Don't be so harsh on her.

457
00:42:33.031 --> 00:42:35.000
She just wants to be famous too.

458
00:42:36.201 --> 00:42:39.170
Okay, nice. Looking good.

459
00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.741
Can you retouch her makeup and check her hair?

460
00:42:44.071 --> 00:42:45.141
You look amazing.

461
00:42:46.141 --> 00:42:47.281
We'll take a break.

462
00:42:48.081 --> 00:42:50.210
Mr. Han, I especially love this photo.

463
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:51.581
This one looks great too.

464
00:42:51.581 --> 00:42:52.880
You're amazing as always.

465
00:42:53.511 --> 00:42:54.821
Why those...

466
00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:57.821
Is she having a spasm? Why are her lashes flickering?

467
00:42:57.821 --> 00:43:01.460
Keep your hands to yourselves, you wenches.

468
00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:03.420
He's Ms. Jang's property.

469
00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:05.460
Why don't we let them know that?

470
00:43:06.831 --> 00:43:07.960
Yes, let's do that.

471
00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:11.931
This too.

472
00:43:12.371 --> 00:43:13.840
You're an amazing photographer.

473
00:43:22.081 --> 00:43:23.540
Let's change outfits.

474
00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.831
Ha Ri, we'll leave you to it then.

475
00:43:45.531 --> 00:43:47.371
- Good luck. - You're the best.

476
00:43:47.371 --> 00:43:50.000
- We wish you luck. - Go for it!

477
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:52.511
You're the best. Good luck.

478
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:03.721
Hello, I'm Jang Ha Ri, editor-in-chief of "The Baby".

479
00:44:04.351 --> 00:44:05.790
I see. It's good to see you.

480
00:44:07.161 --> 00:44:08.960
Didn't you try to book me before?

481
00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:10.991
I remember getting a few offers.

482
00:44:11.261 --> 00:44:13.931
Of course we called. You're Jeon Tae Hui after all.

483
00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.270
I even reviewed the essay you wrote on childrearing.

484
00:44:23.071 --> 00:44:24.571
I'm sorry, but I'll decline...

485
00:44:24.571 --> 00:44:26.071
if you're asking me to be in your magazine.

486
00:44:26.571 --> 00:44:28.340
I don't let strangers interview me, you see.

487
00:44:28.581 --> 00:44:30.551
Most of them end up making things up.

488
00:44:34.851 --> 00:44:37.391
What if we became well-acquainted then?

489
00:44:37.391 --> 00:44:38.951
I'll give you some space.

490
00:44:40.051 --> 00:44:42.821
You're a celebrity and I'm a journalist,

491
00:44:43.831 --> 00:44:46.261
so we both are biased toward one another.

492
00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.630
However, we also don't know each other.

493
00:44:49.161 --> 00:44:52.331
So how about we talk for a little while...

494
00:44:52.331 --> 00:44:53.331
and you get to know me?

495
00:44:53.431 --> 00:44:56.440
You can agree to the interview if you think I'm trustworthy enough.

496
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:04.281
Maybe if Mr. Han asked...

497
00:45:06.181 --> 00:45:08.621
May I ask how you two know each other?

498
00:45:09.781 --> 00:45:13.391
Mr. Han and I?

499
00:45:15.161 --> 00:45:16.190
Why would you bring me into this...

500
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:20.360
when it's her putting effort into your interview?

501
00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:25.871
You can trust her. I've worked with no one better.

502
00:45:29.071 --> 00:45:31.011
While working close to moms,

503
00:45:31.110 --> 00:45:33.040
instead of learning how to kiss up to them,

504
00:45:34.241 --> 00:45:36.440
she learned how to move them.

505
00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.000
You won't have to explain yourself to her at length.

506
00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:59.101
Even if you say the minimum, she'll fully get you.

507
00:46:06.571 --> 00:46:09.181
If you're done with your makeup, let's get back to the photo shoot.

508
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:21.121
(Your visions at this company)

509
00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:34.170
(Annoying Jerk)

510
00:46:35.801 --> 00:46:38.471
- Yes, what is it? - What took you so long to pick up?

511
00:46:38.571 --> 00:46:39.810
I'm busy, that's why.

512
00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:41.210
Are you busy later today?

513
00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.281
Can we meet?

514
00:46:44.181 --> 00:46:45.351
What for?

515
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:47.621
I'll buy dinner, so promise to meet me.

516
00:46:48.821 --> 00:46:49.951
Okay, fine.

517
00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:53.420
Darn, I'm busy as it is.

518
00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.491
Gosh, this is good.

519
00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.201
Is Ha Ri breaking up with him?

520
00:47:03.301 --> 00:47:04.871
What? Why?

521
00:47:05.331 --> 00:47:08.500
That was a question, not a statement.

522
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:11.810
- Did she tell you anything? - No.

523
00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:15.241
Something's up.

524
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:21.121
Why did you ignore my warning,

525
00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:24.551
call me out late at night, bribe me with chicken, and ask about them?

526
00:47:25.051 --> 00:47:26.150
What do you want?

527
00:47:26.351 --> 00:47:28.020
Why do you disapprove of me so?

528
00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.290
Is there a reason other than the fact that I have a kid?

529
00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:38.331
I know you were willing to say anything to keep Jeong Won,

530
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:39.770
but was that necessary?

531
00:47:41.371 --> 00:47:42.500
What?

532
00:47:45.411 --> 00:47:49.241
I hate you for not even knowing...

533
00:47:49.641 --> 00:47:50.980
that you hurt her.

534
00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:05.360
Hello?

535
00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.931
- Are you on your way? - Yes.

536
00:48:08.301 --> 00:48:09.761
I don't believe you.

537
00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.871
Don't stray anywhere else, and come quickly.

538
00:48:12.871 --> 00:48:14.670
I'm exhausted.

539
00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:16.900
What's with this attitude?

540
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:20.440
Is that how you talk to someone bringing you fresh underwear?

541
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:24.411
I'm talking on the phone in the politest position.

542
00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:28.250
Yoon Jae Young. Don't you dare me bring you underwear again.

543
00:48:28.621 --> 00:48:31.020
Jeong Won will be offended.

544
00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:36.060
She hasn't been home in over a week either.

545
00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.991
I'm sure she'll understand.

546
00:48:38.261 --> 00:48:40.831
Fine, fine. Gosh.

547
00:49:08.721 --> 00:49:10.321
I'm exhausted.

548
00:49:12.031 --> 00:49:13.130
Did you get some sleep?

549
00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:16.701
I'm going to go home. I'll sleep after I wash up.

550
00:49:22.371 --> 00:49:23.940
You need to wash up.

551
00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:25.411
You're out of underwear, right?

552
00:49:25.871 --> 00:49:28.440
Ha Ri is bringing me some with clothes to change.

553
00:49:31.281 --> 00:49:33.480
Ha Ri is bringing you your underwear?

554
00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:36.581
Yes.

555
00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:40.761
What? I asked a friend for a favor.

556
00:49:44.261 --> 00:49:46.090
What's the big deal?

557
00:49:47.601 --> 00:49:48.701
Jeong Won.

558
00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:00.940
Must you get mad at this?

559
00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:02.641
If not, we should break up.

560
00:50:02.741 --> 00:50:04.551
Don't say that.

561
00:50:04.551 --> 00:50:07.581
I really dislike the fact that your best friend is a girl.

562
00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:10.150
But not only that, she goes over to my guy's place anytime,

563
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:12.650
and touches his underwear. How could I be understanding?

564
00:50:13.351 --> 00:50:15.621
I haven't been home in a month.

565
00:50:16.090 --> 00:50:18.190
You barely get any sleep either.

566
00:50:18.690 --> 00:50:21.031
Ha Ri was the only person I could ask.

567
00:50:21.031 --> 00:50:22.060
Then...

568
00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:25.130
can a guy friend touch my underwear?

569
00:50:26.101 --> 00:50:27.230
Hey, Jeong Won.

570
00:50:28.141 --> 00:50:30.101
Ha Ri isn't a female friend.

571
00:50:30.201 --> 00:50:33.141
We're like siblings. She's like my sister.

572
00:50:33.141 --> 00:50:34.380
But she isn't your sister.

573
00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:36.340
She and I have no gender.

574
00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:38.511
We've been friends since we were in our moms' wombs.

575
00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.020
Why are you getting jealous for no reason?

576
00:50:41.451 --> 00:50:42.551
Are they arguing?

577
00:50:43.551 --> 00:50:44.650
Jae Young!

578
00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:49.690
Hold on.

579
00:50:51.031 --> 00:50:52.460
I don't like this relationship.

580
00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.630
If I marry you, it'll feel like the three of us are living together.

581
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:04.710
I'm sorry.

582
00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:11.880
- Are you okay? Darn it. - They scared me.

583
00:51:14.581 --> 00:51:16.621
What is this?

584
00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:27.801
Darn it.

585
00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:30.761
- Sorry, Ha Ri. - For what?

586
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:32.371
I'll call you later.

587
00:51:33.431 --> 00:51:35.040
Hey. Your underwear...

588
00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.101
Hey, you freak! Your underwear...

589
00:51:41.641 --> 00:51:43.110
Please give this...

590
00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:44.781
- to Dr. Yoon Jae Young. - Okay.

591
00:51:48.451 --> 00:51:50.351
I'll do it. Why not?

592
00:51:51.891 --> 00:51:53.020
I won't see Ha Ri again.

593
00:51:53.351 --> 00:51:55.161
You're the one that matters to me right now.

594
00:51:55.161 --> 00:51:56.621
Do you think you can do that?

595
00:51:58.360 --> 00:51:59.491
I won't...

596
00:52:01.931 --> 00:52:04.331
see Ha Ri again. For the rest of my life.

597
00:52:05.801 --> 00:52:07.000
I'll do it.

598
00:52:17.181 --> 00:52:18.980
And I thought he was my friend.

599
00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.451
Ha Ri heard that?

600
00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:29.891
She may have understood, but it still hurt.

601
00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:32.360
Then you cut off all ties.

602
00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.500
She only heard about your wedding from her mother.

603
00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:37.630
If you...

604
00:52:38.571 --> 00:52:41.801
dumped a blood-relative-like friend, you should've been happy together.

605
00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:46.610
Whatever. It's not my business.

606
00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:50.840
I should bring some chicken for the kids.

607
00:52:51.011 --> 00:52:53.750
One fried and one spicy to go please.

608
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:54.851
Okay.

609
00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:21.110
What now?

610
00:53:26.281 --> 00:53:27.351
Hey.

611
00:53:31.221 --> 00:53:32.851
When did you shove them in there?

612
00:53:32.851 --> 00:53:34.920
So why are you doing my laundry?

613
00:53:35.261 --> 00:53:36.960
You should've refused, and made me stop.

614
00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:39.290
You should've stayed angry. Why did you give in?

615
00:53:40.531 --> 00:53:41.601
To a bad friend like me.

616
00:53:41.601 --> 00:53:43.400
See? You're complaining even when I'm nice.

617
00:53:43.601 --> 00:53:45.201
You should've told me to get lost.

618
00:53:45.871 --> 00:53:47.500
You never should've talked to me again.

619
00:53:51.011 --> 00:53:52.141
Idiot.

620
00:53:55.011 --> 00:53:57.081
Why do you take it all like it doesn't bother you?

621
00:54:02.581 --> 00:54:03.721
Sorry about everything.

622
00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:14.190
Hey.

623
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:29.641
Again.

624
00:54:32.681 --> 00:54:34.281
Okay. Play.

625
00:54:34.281 --> 00:54:36.650
Okay. Sure. Okay.

626
00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:39.590
Be more natural.

627
00:54:39.991 --> 00:54:41.790
Stop it. Don't do the V.

628
00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:45.261
Kids. Let's not do this.

629
00:54:45.431 --> 00:54:46.690
Just have fun playing.

630
00:54:47.391 --> 00:54:48.960
Did I tell you...

631
00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.371
to do the V or not when you take pictures?

632
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:52.701
You said to do it.

633
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:55.701
Well... Okay.

634
00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:58.440
But that's only when you take them with me.

635
00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.940
Not when Mr. Han takes your pictures, okay?

636
00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:02.880
But it'll go "click" only after I hold up a V.

637
00:55:03.641 --> 00:55:07.051
He isn't going "click" right now.

638
00:55:07.051 --> 00:55:10.181
Just play among yourselves. Don't look here.

639
00:55:10.181 --> 00:55:11.891
But he went, "Click".

640
00:55:12.121 --> 00:55:13.650
- Why you... - Ma'am.

641
00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:15.790
It may be better for you not to watch.

642
00:55:15.891 --> 00:55:17.290
Okay.

643
00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:20.431
Okay. Okay. Get it together.

644
00:55:20.431 --> 00:55:22.431
- Smile! Big smile! - Okay.

645
00:55:23.201 --> 00:55:25.630
Okay. Good. Nice.

646
00:55:25.871 --> 00:55:26.900
Hello.

647
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:28.471
- Hi. - Hey.

648
00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:30.540
Okay.

649
00:55:32.241 --> 00:55:34.610
Let's do it one more time. Okay.

650
00:55:34.610 --> 00:55:35.681
It's fun.

651
00:55:36.141 --> 00:55:38.911
Eu Ddeum. I heard that table is being transformed.

652
00:55:39.081 --> 00:55:40.951
Yes. Just a minute.

653
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:45.221
Kids, I've brought you something amazing.

654
00:55:45.621 --> 00:55:47.351
Guess what I've prepared?

655
00:55:47.721 --> 00:55:49.790
Ta-da!

656
00:55:50.321 --> 00:55:53.860
I'm going to hide these jellies in there.

657
00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:57.500
Only the person who finds these can do the V.

658
00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:58.701
- Okay. - Okay!

659
00:55:58.931 --> 00:55:59.971
Close your eyes.

660
00:55:59.971 --> 00:56:01.241
No peeking.

661
00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:05.770
Why is he so smart?

662
00:56:07.471 --> 00:56:08.480
Eu Ddeum?

663
00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:11.851
Pardon? No, no. That table.

664
00:56:11.951 --> 00:56:13.081
The table.

665
00:56:15.551 --> 00:56:17.891
Now, open your eyes!

666
00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:19.590
You may begin.

667
00:56:21.020 --> 00:56:23.761
Okay. Let's see who finds it first.

668
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:26.290
Do the V.

669
00:56:28.331 --> 00:56:30.661
Slow down. You'll fall.

670
00:56:30.831 --> 00:56:33.270
Hey. Wait! Slowly! Slowly!

671
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:35.270
- Did the shoot go well? - Ha Ri.

672
00:56:35.701 --> 00:56:37.301
They were pains in the neck.

673
00:56:37.301 --> 00:56:38.371
Aren't you busy?

674
00:56:38.371 --> 00:56:40.071
I'm using you to take a break.

675
00:56:40.071 --> 00:56:41.181
Come here.

676
00:56:41.610 --> 00:56:44.511
- Really? - Let's go.

677
00:56:45.451 --> 00:56:47.920
I think I saw him in passing.

678
00:56:48.281 --> 00:56:50.480
Hey. When will you introduce him to me?

679
00:56:53.491 --> 00:56:55.761
Is it nice dating? What do you like the best?

680
00:57:00.531 --> 00:57:03.000
What's wrong? Did something happen with him?

681
00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:08.940
Everything was great.

682
00:57:09.971 --> 00:57:11.710
I wanted to be with him.

683
00:57:12.971 --> 00:57:14.880
And I missed him the moment we said goodbye.

684
00:57:16.781 --> 00:57:19.210
And what I liked most about him...

685
00:57:19.781 --> 00:57:20.810
Well...

686
00:57:21.781 --> 00:57:25.150
You know the little stuff that make you feel really close?

687
00:57:31.391 --> 00:57:33.190
The way we touched each other...

688
00:57:34.031 --> 00:57:36.831
felt so natural and normal.

689
00:57:39.201 --> 00:57:41.670
He really felt like my person.

690
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:46.270
The small and friendly things we did...

691
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:51.210
made it seem like we really belonged to each other.

692
00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:55.750
It felt so nice to be loved.

693
00:58:05.431 --> 00:58:07.590
And he could see my true self...

694
00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:13.000
even when I felt so small.

695
00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:22.011
He's someone who's able to recognize the real me.

696
00:58:28.451 --> 00:58:29.650
But what should I do?

697
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:34.590
Apparently, he can't...

698
00:58:36.221 --> 00:58:38.331
have babies just like me.

699
00:58:59.081 --> 00:59:00.980
- I need to go to the bathroom. - Okay.

700
00:59:06.491 --> 00:59:09.161
(Urology Clinic)

701
00:59:17.031 --> 00:59:20.630
(Male Infertility Clinic)

702
00:59:30.340 --> 00:59:31.610
Is this why?

703
00:59:59.411 --> 01:00:00.641
Mr. Han.

704
01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.250
I'll keep it short. I want you to break up with her.

705
01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:15.321
Ha Ri won't be able to do it because she's too nice.

706
01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:18.230
She'll feel guilty about abandoning you.

707
01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.991
So you should leave her instead of making her feel that way.

708
01:00:23.531 --> 01:00:25.201
Leave us to deal with it.

709
01:00:25.201 --> 01:00:27.301
You never should've started anything in the first place...

710
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.741
if you knew about your condition.

711
01:00:36.511 --> 01:00:38.451
I couldn't ignore my feelings for her.

712
01:00:40.081 --> 01:00:41.451
You selfish jerk.

713
01:00:42.321 --> 01:00:45.690
Think of Ha Ri and ask yourself if you're qualified.

714
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:48.360
What about you?

715
01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.261
Do you think you're qualified?

716
01:01:26.331 --> 01:01:28.230
(Nitwit)

717
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:32.871
Where are you right now?

718
01:01:42.810 --> 01:01:44.141
What do you want?

719
01:01:46.081 --> 01:01:47.951
Did you know about Han I Sang's problem?

720
01:01:50.650 --> 01:01:51.721
You knew?

721
01:01:52.391 --> 01:01:53.891
You dated him even if you knew?

722
01:01:56.690 --> 01:01:58.190
How did you find out?

723
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:01.360
Just break up with him.

724
01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.701
Don't waste your time on something that won't work out.

725
01:02:05.801 --> 01:02:07.831
Is it that easy for you to abandon people?

726
01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:12.540
It wasn't easy.

727
01:02:13.511 --> 01:02:15.281
It wasn't easy cutting ties with you or Jeong Won.

728
01:02:17.241 --> 01:02:18.551
But back then,

729
01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:23.020
I was worried I might regret it if I let go of Jeong Won.

730
01:02:25.551 --> 01:02:28.391
Then why are you telling me to break up with him?

731
01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:32.230
Because right now,

732
01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:35.960
I regret having abandoned you back then.

733
01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:39.630
You'll end up regretting your decision...

734
01:02:39.831 --> 01:02:41.540
no matter what you choose.

735
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.071
Between him and a baby,

736
01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:48.281
think of what you want more desperately.

737
01:02:51.181 --> 01:02:52.451
I don't know.

738
01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:54.851
Ha Ri.

739
01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.821
If you keep seeing him, things will only become more difficult.

740
01:03:00.491 --> 01:03:01.821
Are you sure you won't regret...

741
01:03:03.221 --> 01:03:05.431
having missed your chance to get what you want?

742
01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:12.571
(I Sang)

743
01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:24.181
Right now, I want to see him.

744
01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.310
Did you meet Jae Young?

745
01:04:06.391 --> 01:04:09.020
Nothing happened. You don't need to worry.

746
01:04:09.761 --> 01:04:11.420
What are you trying to do?

747
01:04:16.701 --> 01:04:19.000
Your life depends on this.

748
01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:23.101
So let's try to think of what to do.

749
01:04:24.371 --> 01:04:28.380
I'll also do everything I can to make it work...

750
01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:29.940
What if there's no miracle?

751
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:34.250
What if I turn out to be wrong?

752
01:04:37.181 --> 01:04:38.520
What will I do then?

753
01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.821
We should do our best until the very end.

754
01:04:46.031 --> 01:04:47.891
I didn't start this only to give up so easily.

755
01:04:52.331 --> 01:04:54.270
I just don't think I can do this.

756
01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:19.190
Just think of one thing.

757
01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:24.960
Are you sure you want to lose me?

758
01:06:01.101 --> 01:06:03.040
Is that why women always choose the baby...

759
01:06:03.701 --> 01:06:05.710
if they had to choose...

760
01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:09.781
between the person they love or their baby?

761
01:06:11.911 --> 01:06:13.150
I won't let go...

762
01:06:15.321 --> 01:06:16.380
of the person I love.

763
01:06:18.551 --> 01:06:20.991
I know that having a baby is a miracle.

764
01:06:22.860 --> 01:06:26.190
But I haven't fallen in love for the past 10 years,

765
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:29.860
so love is also a miracle to me.

766
01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:32.770
It wasn't a mistake.

767
01:06:34.031 --> 01:06:35.241
I...

768
01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:38.971
like you, Ms. Jang.

769
01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:41.841
No.

770
01:07:46.871 --> 01:07:48.010
I can't.

771
01:08:32.251 --> 01:08:35.190
(Oh My Baby)

772
01:08:35.491 --> 01:08:39.230
Even if the results aren't good, I'll keep trying until it works.

773
01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:40.961
Is there an issue with him?

774
01:08:40.961 --> 01:08:42.800
No, he's not that kind of person.

775
01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.760
Must you put yourself through this?

776
01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:46.800
I like him a lot.

777
01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.571
How about we go on a trip?

778
01:08:48.741 --> 01:08:50.701
Why do you keep on waiting?

779
01:08:50.841 --> 01:08:53.270
Why wait when you don't know if he'll be here or not?

780
01:08:53.371 --> 01:08:56.010
Him showing up isn't what's important.

781
01:08:56.241 --> 01:08:58.810
What matters is that I'm waiting for him.

782
01:08:59.281 --> 01:09:01.350
Why would you wait for a guy...

783
01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.680
you can't be certain about?
