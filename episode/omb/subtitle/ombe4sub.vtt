(Jambi Studio)

2
00:00:51.924 --> 00:00:53.494
Just a second.

3
00:00:56.724 --> 00:00:59.395
How long do we need to do this? I'm getting cramps on my face.

4
00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:01.304
Don't look her way.

5
00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:04.135
The look in her eyes is telling me...

6
00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:05.704
that a crazy idea is forming inside her head.

7
00:01:05.704 --> 00:01:07.374
Acknowledge her now, and you'll be in trouble.

8
00:01:07.474 --> 00:01:09.675
Why? Why will we be in trouble?

9
00:01:10.075 --> 00:01:11.715
There's no safe zone around Jang Ha Ri.

10
00:01:14.885 --> 00:01:17.385
I didn't do anything wrong.

11
00:01:17.484 --> 00:01:18.755
I'm a bit scared.

12
00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:22.755
Since you think you're fine, why don't you deal with her?

13
00:01:25.594 --> 00:01:26.895
Is that really necessary?

14
00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:31.024
I should leave before she talks to me.

15
00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:39.404
Okay, we'll start shooting now.

16
00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:42.805
Loosen up. Bring your shoulders down.

17
00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:45.215
Put your chin down. Look into the camera lens.

18
00:01:45.514 --> 00:01:47.215
1, 2, 3. Let's see you smile.

19
00:01:47.215 --> 00:01:48.745
One more time.

20
00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:50.514
Yoon Jae Young.

21
00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:53.954
He may sound rough, but he has a nice personality.

22
00:01:54.154 --> 00:01:56.055
If my baby takes after him, it'll be smart.

23
00:01:58.355 --> 00:01:59.355
No.

24
00:01:59.355 --> 00:02:02.295
He's too much like a brother.

25
00:02:05.234 --> 00:02:06.295
Han I Sang.

26
00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:09.435
He seems to have a bad personality,

27
00:02:09.435 --> 00:02:11.374
but he's sometimes kind as well.

28
00:02:11.674 --> 00:02:14.204
I like his curiosity and how challenging he is.

29
00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:18.014
No, I won't be able to tell him.

30
00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:21.844
Choi Kang Eu Ddeum.

31
00:02:24.984 --> 00:02:25.984
What is his deal?

32
00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:28.685
- Great work. - You did great.

33
00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:31.495
- Good work. - Great work.

34
00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:33.355
- Thank you. - See you guys.

35
00:02:33.355 --> 00:02:34.394
What?

36
00:02:35.195 --> 00:02:36.264
You're going?

37
00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:37.764
She just left.

38
00:02:39.334 --> 00:02:41.304
- You did great. - You too.

39
00:02:44.065 --> 00:02:45.905
Where are you three going?

40
00:02:51.375 --> 00:02:54.045
I need to go home and take care of Do Ah.

41
00:02:54.045 --> 00:02:55.744
Your mom's probably having a hard time.

42
00:02:55.785 --> 00:02:58.184
I'm going to tell Mr. Kim that the shoot went well.

43
00:02:58.454 --> 00:03:01.524
I need to go to a shoot after lunch. Do you have something to say?

44
00:03:02.454 --> 00:03:04.755
Let me buy you lunch.

45
00:03:05.494 --> 00:03:07.725
That's great. You guys can eat together.

46
00:03:07.725 --> 00:03:08.795
- He's right. - Enjoy.

47
00:03:09.095 --> 00:03:10.095
Where are you going?

48
00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:13.494
My mom's free all afternoon.

49
00:03:14.864 --> 00:03:16.065
What's the matter with you?

50
00:03:16.304 --> 00:03:18.905
She can't watch Do Ah all day. She'll be exhausted.

51
00:03:19.005 --> 00:03:22.405
Then don't make her cook for you. Eat lunch with me.

52
00:03:23.174 --> 00:03:25.575
She's right. The three of you can chat...

53
00:03:25.575 --> 00:03:27.274
and have fun together.

54
00:03:27.274 --> 00:03:28.614
Eu Ddeum, you should come with us.

55
00:03:30.114 --> 00:03:32.614
Mr. Kim left to meet a client.

56
00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:36.255
He's probably back by now.

57
00:03:36.385 --> 00:03:38.325
This morning, I heard him say very loudly...

58
00:03:38.325 --> 00:03:40.125
that he has a lunch meeting with a client.

59
00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:42.295
- Eu Ddeum. - Yes?

60
00:03:42.295 --> 00:03:43.924
I have a lunch meeting with a client.

61
00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:44.994
I'll be back pretty late.

62
00:03:45.565 --> 00:03:46.764
Sorry. What?

63
00:03:49.464 --> 00:03:51.475
I'm going to be back...

64
00:03:51.804 --> 00:03:53.635
after lunch.

65
00:03:53.905 --> 00:03:55.545
I'm going to have lunch outside.

66
00:03:56.445 --> 00:03:57.475
I'll be back late.

67
00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:02.315
Let's go.

68
00:04:03.415 --> 00:04:04.415
Come on.

69
00:04:09.684 --> 00:04:12.095
Brace yourselves. We'll be okay.

70
00:04:21.505 --> 00:04:24.565
What's going on? Are you picking your future husband?

71
00:04:26.135 --> 00:04:27.575
Let me see.

72
00:04:28.244 --> 00:04:29.575
I choose...

73
00:04:30.445 --> 00:04:31.975
I'll send you a text.

74
00:04:32.445 --> 00:04:33.445
Good luck.

75
00:04:38.315 --> 00:04:39.815
Why isn't anyone sitting beside me?

76
00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:42.084
Right now, we're on the same side.

77
00:04:42.385 --> 00:04:45.025
Why did you suddenly want to eat with us?

78
00:04:45.624 --> 00:04:47.655
I just figured we should be friends.

79
00:04:48.265 --> 00:04:51.064
The three of you got to know each other,

80
00:04:51.064 --> 00:04:53.934
so I think we should take that friendship to another level.

81
00:04:55.804 --> 00:04:57.364
I guess we were scared for nothing.

82
00:04:57.665 --> 00:05:00.335
We became close because we were all scared of you.

83
00:05:00.434 --> 00:05:02.045
You're pretty fearless.

84
00:05:02.275 --> 00:05:04.275
It's because he's young. He doesn't know what's coming.

85
00:05:05.015 --> 00:05:06.015
Am I scary?

86
00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:09.345
Look in the mirror and see your eyes. They're very scary.

87
00:05:10.114 --> 00:05:11.215
Well...

88
00:05:11.684 --> 00:05:14.415
Now that I've aged, I realize that friends are precious.

89
00:05:14.684 --> 00:05:16.955
Let's get together often like this, get close,

90
00:05:16.955 --> 00:05:18.395
and check on each other's health status.

91
00:05:18.895 --> 00:05:22.494
- That being said, Eu Ddeum... - Yes?

92
00:05:22.725 --> 00:05:24.465
You seem quite healthy to me.

93
00:05:24.564 --> 00:05:26.234
Does it run in the family?

94
00:05:26.835 --> 00:05:29.765
I doubt your family has had any medical issues.

95
00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:32.374
No one in my family has been sick.

96
00:05:32.374 --> 00:05:33.574
I see.

97
00:05:34.674 --> 00:05:36.674
Meanwhile, my body isn't what it used to be.

98
00:05:36.674 --> 00:05:38.814
They say your body starts to power down...

99
00:05:38.814 --> 00:05:40.314
the moment you hit that 40 mark.

100
00:05:40.314 --> 00:05:44.114
That must be what's happening to me. I ache here and there. Right?

101
00:05:44.285 --> 00:05:45.785
That's not the case for me.

102
00:05:45.785 --> 00:05:47.554
- No underlying illnesses? - No.

103
00:05:47.984 --> 00:05:49.254
I see. That's good.

104
00:05:49.984 --> 00:05:53.694
We're at an age where health is a touchy subject for us.

105
00:05:54.324 --> 00:05:56.465
Hangovers aren't cured until the next evening...

106
00:05:56.465 --> 00:05:58.295
and it takes two days to recover from an all-nighter.

107
00:05:58.535 --> 00:06:00.095
So before we're hit with something bad,

108
00:06:00.194 --> 00:06:03.804
we should check our health at least twice a day.

109
00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:07.574
The doctor in me says that you have a liver problem.

110
00:06:08.004 --> 00:06:09.405
You can't have a part of mine though.

111
00:06:09.405 --> 00:06:10.874
It has hardened from all the liquor.

112
00:06:12.045 --> 00:06:13.114
You're out.

113
00:06:13.275 --> 00:06:14.415
Nice!

114
00:06:15.285 --> 00:06:17.585
You two seem like real siblings.

115
00:06:17.915 --> 00:06:19.054
How long have you been friends?

116
00:06:19.355 --> 00:06:20.915
Unfortunately, since in utero.

117
00:06:21.585 --> 00:06:22.725
Our moms were friends.

118
00:06:24.184 --> 00:06:26.754
No wonder you two are like elementary school kids.

119
00:06:27.295 --> 00:06:28.494
You're a polite one, aren't you?

120
00:06:29.194 --> 00:06:30.795
You just bad-mouthed us while holding a smile.

121
00:06:31.994 --> 00:06:33.965
I thought you were cousins.

122
00:06:34.494 --> 00:06:35.535
His aunt's daughter.

123
00:06:35.634 --> 00:06:36.934
You thought we were cousins?

124
00:06:37.364 --> 00:06:39.504
I'm her friend. Her boyfriend.

125
00:06:39.775 --> 00:06:41.905
Her boyfriend? Is he your boyfriend?

126
00:06:42.004 --> 00:06:44.374
No, a friend who's a boy. Don't mix those two up.

127
00:06:46.114 --> 00:06:48.345
Then why do you live together?

128
00:06:48.444 --> 00:06:51.585
- Well, he's putting us out... - Who says we can't?

129
00:06:55.424 --> 00:06:56.455
Especially when...

130
00:07:00.395 --> 00:07:01.795
we're this close?

131
00:07:04.064 --> 00:07:05.795
Yes, you're close enough to be smacked.

132
00:07:06.895 --> 00:07:07.895
Goodness.

133
00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:12.105
Anyway, it's nice to finally get to know you better.

134
00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:15.405
Let's keep this up and gradually get to know each other...

135
00:07:15.775 --> 00:07:16.944
even more.

136
00:07:17.174 --> 00:07:18.205
Sounds good.

137
00:07:18.314 --> 00:07:19.775
- Cheers. - Cheers.

138
00:07:19.775 --> 00:07:20.874
Cheers, everyone.

139
00:07:20.874 --> 00:07:23.515
All right. Here you go.

140
00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:30.184
(Episode 4: The Time One Needs to Understand Others)

141
00:07:32.725 --> 00:07:33.725
Stop right there.

142
00:07:40.395 --> 00:07:41.395
Follow me.

143
00:07:44.634 --> 00:07:45.705
Get back here!

144
00:07:47.074 --> 00:07:48.105
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:48.744 --> 00:07:50.174
I know it's something to be frowned upon.

146
00:07:50.174 --> 00:07:51.345
Didn't you know that?

147
00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:53.215
I didn't think I'd get caught.

148
00:07:54.074 --> 00:07:56.415
I understand how it can be frowned upon,

149
00:07:57.415 --> 00:08:01.285
but I don't think what I did was that wrong.

150
00:08:03.955 --> 00:08:07.194
Why should one's marital status make one's decision ethical?

151
00:08:07.295 --> 00:08:09.525
Am I supposed to engage in a debate?

152
00:08:10.194 --> 00:08:13.194
It's easy for everyone to accept how a married couple...

153
00:08:13.194 --> 00:08:14.665
would want a baby.

154
00:08:14.835 --> 00:08:17.734
What many can't accept is considered crazy.

155
00:08:18.705 --> 00:08:20.335
Am I a crazy cow then?

156
00:08:20.574 --> 00:08:21.744
Don't be too shocked by it.

157
00:08:21.944 --> 00:08:23.944
I never once thought you were in your right mind anyway.

158
00:08:24.345 --> 00:08:25.515
That's actually quite comforting.

159
00:08:31.415 --> 00:08:33.285
If you're going to set off a bomb,

160
00:08:33.754 --> 00:08:34.955
make sure the explosion's big.

161
00:08:42.924 --> 00:08:44.595
Are you siding with me?

162
00:08:45.335 --> 00:08:48.634
No. Let's just put it as me understanding how desperate you are.

163
00:08:49.105 --> 00:08:50.364
Just make sure you deal with the mess yourself.

164
00:08:52.074 --> 00:08:53.934
I doubt any harm was done.

165
00:08:54.775 --> 00:08:56.405
Only our people would recognize me anyway.

166
00:08:56.574 --> 00:08:58.915
Exactly. We all recognized you.

167
00:09:03.045 --> 00:09:04.885
- It's her, right? - Yes.

168
00:09:13.995 --> 00:09:15.865
So it's gossip over colleagues.

169
00:09:18.795 --> 00:09:19.865
Ha Ri.

170
00:09:23.834 --> 00:09:24.964
Please enjoy.

171
00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:27.434
Is it true?

172
00:09:28.704 --> 00:09:31.245
- What are people saying? - That it's not your first time...

173
00:09:32.074 --> 00:09:34.775
and that it's how you got pregnant with your first child.

174
00:09:34.875 --> 00:09:36.985
- Did I have a son or daughter? - Daughter.

175
00:09:36.985 --> 00:09:39.684
- Who does she take after? - She's a miniature version of you.

176
00:09:40.155 --> 00:09:41.214
Then she'll be cute.

177
00:09:41.214 --> 00:09:43.785
Hold on. That I didn't hear.

178
00:09:45.094 --> 00:09:47.854
Anyway, I hope that this unknown child of mine...

179
00:09:47.854 --> 00:09:50.224
lives a great life without her mother.

180
00:09:52.365 --> 00:09:54.334
You're going to let people say...

181
00:09:54.334 --> 00:09:56.304
that you abandoned your child?

182
00:09:57.704 --> 00:10:01.304
I can't believe she isn't taking this seriously.

183
00:10:02.574 --> 00:10:03.574
Gosh.

184
00:10:11.854 --> 00:10:13.015
If I don't get married?

185
00:10:14.084 --> 00:10:15.354
If you're gone?

186
00:10:16.354 --> 00:10:18.084
Should I live just for myself?

187
00:10:18.995 --> 00:10:20.655
You say you live for me.

188
00:10:22.064 --> 00:10:23.625
Should I live alone without any family,

189
00:10:24.064 --> 00:10:27.365
living just for myself, and then die alone?

190
00:10:31.334 --> 00:10:32.704
But you'll be too lonely.

191
00:10:35.245 --> 00:10:36.875
When you're old, everything is upsetting.

192
00:10:39.745 --> 00:10:41.015
If you have no one,

193
00:10:43.115 --> 00:10:44.844
who will take care of you when you're sick?

194
00:10:58.094 --> 00:11:00.094
Auntie, are you drinking?

195
00:11:00.995 --> 00:11:03.204
- You shouldn't. - Shut it...

196
00:11:03.635 --> 00:11:04.704
and get over here.

197
00:11:09.005 --> 00:11:10.104
Jae Young.

198
00:11:11.704 --> 00:11:13.375
What do you think of Ha Ri?

199
00:11:16.184 --> 00:11:18.755
Mom. Can I call you that instead of Auntie?

200
00:11:19.054 --> 00:11:20.985
You seem more like my mom these days.

201
00:11:23.285 --> 00:11:24.684
What are you getting at?

202
00:11:24.684 --> 00:11:26.354
Ha Ri and I have been friends since birth.

203
00:11:26.795 --> 00:11:28.054
We're already family.

204
00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:30.324
And all I want to do is make it official on paper.

205
00:11:30.924 --> 00:11:32.964
Why won't you see Ha Ri as a woman?

206
00:11:33.194 --> 00:11:35.365
She's pretty, kind, humorous,

207
00:11:35.665 --> 00:11:37.064
and charming.

208
00:11:37.505 --> 00:11:38.804
It's hard not to be attracted to her.

209
00:11:39.505 --> 00:11:40.604
I know.

210
00:11:42.704 --> 00:11:44.745
Of course I'm aware that Ha Ri's a catch.

211
00:11:45.674 --> 00:11:47.045
It's why I'm not the man for her.

212
00:11:50.145 --> 00:11:51.214
Come on.

213
00:11:51.814 --> 00:11:55.354
Why would you want her to be with a single father?

214
00:11:56.255 --> 00:11:58.084
She should marry someone...

215
00:11:59.724 --> 00:12:01.554
who is better than me.

216
00:12:03.824 --> 00:12:04.995
Of course she should.

217
00:12:23.584 --> 00:12:24.714
Darn, it hurts.

218
00:12:24.714 --> 00:12:25.854
My gosh!

219
00:12:30.584 --> 00:12:31.995
It hurts.

220
00:12:38.694 --> 00:12:39.795
Seriously?

221
00:12:47.775 --> 00:12:48.844
Here.

222
00:12:49.405 --> 00:12:50.444
Let's go.

223
00:12:52.015 --> 00:12:53.015
We live together.

224
00:12:55.714 --> 00:12:58.115
Then why do you live together?

225
00:12:58.115 --> 00:13:01.354
- Well, he's putting us out... - Who says we can't?

226
00:13:04.224 --> 00:13:05.324
Especially when...

227
00:13:07.554 --> 00:13:08.824
we're this close?

228
00:13:18.635 --> 00:13:21.334
How does this make any sense?

229
00:13:21.635 --> 00:13:24.245
A man and a woman who has a close relationship...

230
00:13:24.604 --> 00:13:26.574
are living in the same house?

231
00:13:26.674 --> 00:13:27.674
Answer me.

232
00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:30.515
Why won't you say anything?

233
00:13:31.245 --> 00:13:32.554
Whatever. Forget about it.

234
00:13:33.485 --> 00:13:34.485
Unbelievable.

235
00:13:45.265 --> 00:13:47.535
You prepared a feast.

236
00:13:48.464 --> 00:13:49.735
Anyway, thank you.

237
00:13:53.174 --> 00:13:54.735
Everything smells nice.

238
00:13:58.145 --> 00:13:59.974
- Do you want soup? - Yes.

239
00:14:07.615 --> 00:14:08.824
Gosh, it looks delicious.

240
00:14:08.824 --> 00:14:10.184
It sure does.

241
00:14:14.094 --> 00:14:17.265
I'm not saying that I won't ever get married.

242
00:14:18.424 --> 00:14:21.135
But realistically speaking, it's too hard to find anyone.

243
00:14:21.135 --> 00:14:23.665
There aren't any decent guys around me.

244
00:14:24.334 --> 00:14:27.604
I'm at an age where pregnancy is more urgent...

245
00:14:32.745 --> 00:14:35.015
Mom, I...

246
00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:40.255
Just how dense are you?

247
00:14:48.724 --> 00:14:50.025
Come on.

248
00:14:50.025 --> 00:14:51.594
Just how dense are you?

249
00:14:52.035 --> 00:14:54.194
Grandma's already upset as it is.

250
00:14:54.295 --> 00:14:57.635
What are you doing by adding fuel to the flame?

251
00:14:59.804 --> 00:15:01.834
Use your common sense, Mom.

252
00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:05.344
There's no way I'd choose you.

253
00:15:06.415 --> 00:15:09.184
- What do you mean? - Nothing.

254
00:15:10.944 --> 00:15:11.985
What did you just mean?

255
00:15:12.184 --> 00:15:13.354
Just get back to your meal.

256
00:15:13.655 --> 00:15:14.684
I should eat.

257
00:15:35.875 --> 00:15:37.005
(Jambi Studio)

258
00:15:37.005 --> 00:15:38.915
Please put the kids in front.

259
00:15:38.915 --> 00:15:40.645
- Gather round. - Okay.

260
00:15:40.844 --> 00:15:42.444
- Look here, kids. - Look here.

261
00:15:42.444 --> 00:15:44.745
- Look here. Okay. - Right here.

262
00:15:44.745 --> 00:15:45.915
How cute.

263
00:15:46.285 --> 00:15:47.915
Where did you find them?

264
00:15:48.054 --> 00:15:49.625
They look just like each other.

265
00:15:50.054 --> 00:15:52.694
With a little creative liberty, they're the genius father and son,

266
00:15:52.954 --> 00:15:54.824
athletic father and son, and artistic mother and daughter.

267
00:16:02.204 --> 00:16:03.704
He looks normal enough.

268
00:16:06.474 --> 00:16:07.604
He's handsome.

269
00:16:08.275 --> 00:16:10.505
He has a sharp nose and nice jawline.

270
00:16:10.704 --> 00:16:11.844
And fair skin.

271
00:16:15.485 --> 00:16:16.844
I hear he's Ha Ri's friend.

272
00:16:18.184 --> 00:16:20.214
Yes. They've been friends since they were babies.

273
00:16:20.214 --> 00:16:23.485
They grew apart when he got married, but they got close again recently.

274
00:16:24.584 --> 00:16:25.795
He's married?

275
00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:27.694
He adored his wife so very much,

276
00:16:27.694 --> 00:16:29.924
that he was so very annoying from what I heard.

277
00:16:34.235 --> 00:16:37.135
He got divorced and moved into her house with his baby.

278
00:16:38.535 --> 00:16:40.775
- He has a baby? - Exactly.

279
00:16:40.775 --> 00:16:42.405
He even has a baby.

280
00:16:43.245 --> 00:16:45.375
He's perfect for her.

281
00:16:45.515 --> 00:16:47.714
He's a doctor. They know everything about each other.

282
00:16:47.714 --> 00:16:49.145
And he has a baby.

283
00:16:51.684 --> 00:16:52.985
He's dangerous.

284
00:16:53.954 --> 00:16:55.054
What?

285
00:16:55.415 --> 00:16:56.985
He looks like a total con artist.

286
00:17:00.094 --> 00:17:02.525
Look at him being jealous. You've been made.

287
00:17:27.655 --> 00:17:31.084
When you feel anxious, you tend to make bad moves.

288
00:17:37.064 --> 00:17:39.765
I'm saying this in case you date any guy because you want a baby.

289
00:17:41.364 --> 00:17:42.664
What? Why?

290
00:17:43.265 --> 00:17:45.775
Do you think I'll be immature and fall for a bad guy...

291
00:17:45.775 --> 00:17:47.834
and hop on the express train to suffering?

292
00:17:47.834 --> 00:17:51.475
No. You seem to be in a rush to get married and have a baby.

293
00:17:51.745 --> 00:17:53.114
Feel free to make mistakes on me, though.

294
00:17:55.545 --> 00:17:59.015
Whether or not I date a loser, it's none of your business.

295
00:18:00.485 --> 00:18:02.485
Why would you date a loser?

296
00:18:02.755 --> 00:18:05.185
Are you the type who gets love goggles?

297
00:18:05.255 --> 00:18:07.425
Yes, I can't think straight.

298
00:18:07.425 --> 00:18:09.064
All I see is love.

299
00:18:10.124 --> 00:18:12.894
And once I decide against a guy, I never look back,

300
00:18:13.894 --> 00:18:15.195
so don't worry.

301
00:18:19.775 --> 00:18:21.334
- I'm getting dizzy. - Why?

302
00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:22.545
It's so hard to carry on a conversation.

303
00:18:22.874 --> 00:18:24.144
I need a sugar kick.

304
00:18:24.144 --> 00:18:26.874
- My blood sugar level must be low. - What...

305
00:18:29.185 --> 00:18:30.414
What's his problem?

306
00:18:32.485 --> 00:18:34.785
- How about a punch with a "Yap"? - Yap.

307
00:18:38.255 --> 00:18:39.295
Good.

308
00:18:40.854 --> 00:18:41.894
Like this.

309
00:18:47.235 --> 00:18:48.235
Hold on.

310
00:18:48.965 --> 00:18:51.364
Mommy, I'm so hungry, I can't take it.

311
00:18:51.435 --> 00:18:53.404
Can't I have a hot dog?

312
00:19:00.745 --> 00:19:02.015
He's uncomfortable.

313
00:19:13.854 --> 00:19:15.664
Next Wednesday is the anniversary of Father's passing.

314
00:19:16.664 --> 00:19:18.225
Come. Mother's waiting.

315
00:19:44.025 --> 00:19:45.795
Is it Paris this time?

316
00:19:46.455 --> 00:19:49.124
Father gets to tour the world thanks to you.

317
00:19:49.995 --> 00:19:52.664
Hey. Hey. Wait.

318
00:19:54.134 --> 00:19:55.735
Your father drinks water...

319
00:19:57.005 --> 00:19:58.604
before he eats.

320
00:20:08.914 --> 00:20:11.344
- Here. Try this too. - Okay.

321
00:20:11.844 --> 00:20:13.614
- You eat. - Eat up.

322
00:20:15.215 --> 00:20:18.725
Anyway, aren't you going to have a housewarming party?

323
00:20:19.225 --> 00:20:20.854
Set a date. Just the adults can come.

324
00:20:22.094 --> 00:20:23.925
- What? - I Sang.

325
00:20:23.925 --> 00:20:25.265
Our kids are well-behaved.

326
00:20:25.265 --> 00:20:26.634
I have a baby at my place.

327
00:20:27.465 --> 00:20:29.364
What? A baby?

328
00:20:33.235 --> 00:20:35.005
Are you living with her?

329
00:20:35.634 --> 00:20:37.574
No, Mother.

330
00:20:38.205 --> 00:20:39.975
He means a statue made out of stone.

331
00:20:40.074 --> 00:20:41.114
Stone?

332
00:20:43.114 --> 00:20:45.015
Why are you living with a stone?

333
00:20:45.015 --> 00:20:46.785
I bought it recently from Easter Island.

334
00:20:48.114 --> 00:20:49.384
It's precious to me.

335
00:20:50.755 --> 00:20:53.695
They say if you get attached to pets and figurines,

336
00:20:53.824 --> 00:20:55.295
you won't get married.

337
00:20:55.455 --> 00:20:57.295
That's not good.

338
00:20:58.925 --> 00:21:01.594
Do you want to meet a manager from our company?

339
00:21:01.894 --> 00:21:03.134
She's a successful single woman.

340
00:21:03.834 --> 00:21:06.675
It's time to meet someone new.

341
00:21:10.945 --> 00:21:13.114
No, I'm not very social.

342
00:21:17.215 --> 00:21:21.015
Mother can't sleep well because she's worried about you.

343
00:21:21.884 --> 00:21:23.925
How long will you act like a loser and act like...

344
00:21:24.725 --> 00:21:26.554
you're the biggest victim in the world?

345
00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:28.624
Hey. Hey. Don't.

346
00:21:33.965 --> 00:21:35.804
- I'm done. - Hey.

347
00:21:36.465 --> 00:21:37.604
You're not done eating.

348
00:21:38.235 --> 00:21:40.104
- Hey. Hey. - Honey.

349
00:21:40.404 --> 00:21:41.904
That kid.

350
00:21:45.445 --> 00:21:47.844
Uncle. Aren't you marrying In Ah?

351
00:21:48.574 --> 00:21:50.715
Byul, do you still remember In Ah?

352
00:21:50.914 --> 00:21:53.614
In Ah bought me an Elsa dress.

353
00:21:54.354 --> 00:21:55.414
Oh my gosh.

354
00:21:56.324 --> 00:21:59.525
You're so smart. My gosh.

355
00:21:59.525 --> 00:22:03.525
You must be happy that Byul is so smart.

356
00:22:03.765 --> 00:22:06.634
We went to see Cinderella with In Ah.

357
00:22:06.634 --> 00:22:07.935
Byul, shut it.

358
00:22:08.134 --> 00:22:09.604
Uncle's wedding fell through.

359
00:22:09.864 --> 00:22:11.435
In Ah ran away.

360
00:22:11.435 --> 00:22:14.035
In Ah is banned, you stupid moron.

361
00:22:14.134 --> 00:22:17.844
Mommy. He called me a stupid moron.

362
00:22:18.275 --> 00:22:19.374
It's okay.

363
00:22:19.515 --> 00:22:21.775
How could you say that to your little sister?

364
00:22:22.015 --> 00:22:23.114
Watch it!

365
00:22:23.314 --> 00:22:25.245
What did I do wrong?

366
00:22:25.245 --> 00:22:28.084
Quiet down.

367
00:22:37.864 --> 00:22:40.564
Hello. I heard you needed muscle.

368
00:22:41.495 --> 00:22:44.864
We need to get the gift bags for the launch ceremony of "The Mom".

369
00:22:45.164 --> 00:22:47.435
You'll need to make multiple trips.

370
00:22:48.005 --> 00:22:50.175
Hyo Joo. Where are you going?

371
00:22:52.175 --> 00:22:54.445
Excuse me? I have a meeting.

372
00:22:54.874 --> 00:22:56.515
- I'll see you afterward. - No.

373
00:22:57.114 --> 00:22:58.384
You don't have a meeting.

374
00:22:59.384 --> 00:23:01.185
But...

375
00:23:01.554 --> 00:23:04.785
There's a list of gifts there, so don't miss anything.

376
00:23:04.785 --> 00:23:06.854
Don't go 3 times when 2 would've sufficed. Also.

377
00:23:07.054 --> 00:23:09.324
Bring two more bundles of the magazines.

378
00:23:09.795 --> 00:23:10.795
Excuse me?

379
00:23:18.664 --> 00:23:19.735
Who pulls it like that?

380
00:23:21.374 --> 00:23:23.304
Push it like me. It's easier.

381
00:23:24.205 --> 00:23:25.475
Forget it.

382
00:23:27.574 --> 00:23:29.614
I'd like to get it all so you don't have to,

383
00:23:30.914 --> 00:23:33.414
but I know I may be being rude, rather than polite,

384
00:23:33.414 --> 00:23:34.854
to a modern-day working woman.

385
00:23:36.455 --> 00:23:37.854
Who says that?

386
00:23:38.124 --> 00:23:40.495
My mom. She's a feminist.

387
00:23:40.894 --> 00:23:44.164
She told me I shouldn't treat women like they're too weak...

388
00:23:44.164 --> 00:23:46.535
to carry their own bags.

389
00:23:47.535 --> 00:23:49.864
She probably said it because she couldn't stand...

390
00:23:49.864 --> 00:23:52.064
seeing her son carrying his girlfriend's bag.

391
00:23:52.975 --> 00:23:55.205
I'm fine, so pull it for me.

392
00:24:00.275 --> 00:24:01.675
Hello.

393
00:24:05.884 --> 00:24:07.154
Bye. I'll call you.

394
00:24:07.154 --> 00:24:08.414
- Okay. Call me. - Goodbye.

395
00:24:08.414 --> 00:24:09.525
- Have a nice day. - You too.

396
00:24:09.955 --> 00:24:11.824
- Auntie, did you have a meeting? - Bye.

397
00:24:12.185 --> 00:24:13.755
We picked an infertile couple.

398
00:24:14.255 --> 00:24:16.025
- Are you going to the storage room? - Yes.

399
00:24:17.064 --> 00:24:18.195
Are you going to die?

400
00:24:18.265 --> 00:24:21.394
Yes. I think my clothes are going to die soon.

401
00:24:23.134 --> 00:24:25.364
It's the first day it saw the light of day...

402
00:24:27.505 --> 00:24:28.604
Okay.

403
00:24:29.035 --> 00:24:31.045
The storage room is too rough a place for that dress...

404
00:24:35.515 --> 00:24:36.614
I'll go.

405
00:24:39.814 --> 00:24:40.985
Do you mean it?

406
00:24:41.384 --> 00:24:43.955
We can't let the dress die. Let's go.

407
00:24:44.324 --> 00:24:45.425
Okay.

408
00:24:46.124 --> 00:24:47.225
See you.

409
00:24:48.624 --> 00:24:50.025
I can't stand him.

410
00:24:52.695 --> 00:24:55.495
Ms. Jang, should I take this down too?

411
00:24:55.795 --> 00:24:57.705
Be careful.

412
00:24:58.535 --> 00:25:01.074
Don't worry. I used to work at a warehouse,

413
00:25:01.574 --> 00:25:02.804
so I'm used to this.

414
00:25:03.005 --> 00:25:06.215
At a warehouse? You look like you didn't work a day in your life.

415
00:25:06.314 --> 00:25:07.574
It was when I was looking for a job.

416
00:25:08.215 --> 00:25:10.185
I'm glad I worked there. It's coming in handy.

417
00:25:10.785 --> 00:25:11.814
What should I do with these?

418
00:25:12.785 --> 00:25:14.114
Let's just take two.

419
00:25:26.735 --> 00:25:27.735
Okay.

420
00:25:41.545 --> 00:25:42.574
Yes.

421
00:25:43.814 --> 00:25:47.084
The younger they are, the more fertile they'll be.

422
00:25:49.285 --> 00:25:50.584
- What? - What?

423
00:25:54.832 --> 00:25:55.961
Yes.

424
00:25:57.031 --> 00:26:00.302
The younger they are, the more fertile they'll be.

425
00:26:02.531 --> 00:26:03.802
- What? - What?

426
00:26:08.342 --> 00:26:09.642
I was talking about strength.

427
00:26:09.812 --> 00:26:12.612
I meant to say you must have great stamina.

428
00:26:13.251 --> 00:26:16.882
You're young and healthy, so you're probably very active.

429
00:26:16.981 --> 00:26:19.052
And that leads to a high success rate...

430
00:26:22.122 --> 00:26:23.322
"A high success rate"?

431
00:26:24.191 --> 00:26:27.261
I mean, there's a high probability that you'll succeed in life...

432
00:26:28.092 --> 00:26:30.632
because you're healthy.

433
00:26:31.261 --> 00:26:33.701
Both your body and mind.

434
00:26:35.302 --> 00:26:36.572
Thank you, Ms. Jang.

435
00:26:37.102 --> 00:26:39.511
Ms. Jang, is there anything else you need me to help you with?

436
00:26:39.711 --> 00:26:42.511
I'll gladly help you out with my healthy body.

437
00:26:43.082 --> 00:26:45.441
Let's take a few more toys.

438
00:26:45.441 --> 00:26:47.412
Toys? Okay. You got it.

439
00:26:53.092 --> 00:26:54.751
People love that photo.

440
00:26:54.751 --> 00:26:56.062
Do you think they'll keep working with you?

441
00:26:56.562 --> 00:26:57.862
There's no reason not to.

442
00:26:58.761 --> 00:26:59.761
You're right.

443
00:27:00.062 --> 00:27:02.592
Whoever works with you always wants you back.

444
00:27:03.001 --> 00:27:05.102
So I'm going to do the same and ask you to keep working with us.

445
00:27:06.902 --> 00:27:08.332
Gosh, no way.

446
00:27:08.771 --> 00:27:11.302
I'm sick of working with babies.

447
00:27:22.251 --> 00:27:23.922
Excuse me. Sorry.

448
00:27:25.382 --> 00:27:27.691
This is killing me. My entire body aches.

449
00:27:28.822 --> 00:27:30.261
I'll go get you some medicine.

450
00:27:30.261 --> 00:27:31.592
No, it's okay.

451
00:27:31.592 --> 00:27:34.562
My body's just telling me that it's tired.

452
00:27:34.991 --> 00:27:36.531
You don't need to take it too seriously.

453
00:27:37.862 --> 00:27:39.572
You might feel okay right now,

454
00:27:39.572 --> 00:27:41.602
but that might not be the case tomorrow.

455
00:27:41.832 --> 00:27:45.342
It's better to take medicine at your age.

456
00:27:46.211 --> 00:27:47.842
I'm not that old.

457
00:27:48.112 --> 00:27:50.281
Gosh, your pain shows that you're a middle-aged woman.

458
00:27:50.912 --> 00:27:52.181
Should I beat him up?

459
00:27:52.612 --> 00:27:54.181
Wait here. I'll be right back.

460
00:27:54.281 --> 00:27:55.281
Just a second.

461
00:28:09.531 --> 00:28:11.701
Do you think you can take the elevator?

462
00:28:14.132 --> 00:28:17.102
The elevator is packed.

463
00:28:18.441 --> 00:28:20.342
Follow me, okay?

464
00:28:22.441 --> 00:28:23.781
Excuse me.

465
00:28:23.781 --> 00:28:25.541
Can you please make some space?

466
00:28:25.741 --> 00:28:27.681
My mom is too old,

467
00:28:27.681 --> 00:28:29.882
and her body is aching all over.

468
00:28:29.981 --> 00:28:31.521
I may be young,

469
00:28:31.652 --> 00:28:34.392
but my mom is old.

470
00:28:34.691 --> 00:28:36.422
Please do us a favor and let us in.

471
00:28:38.691 --> 00:28:40.491
I can't handle this kid.

472
00:28:42.392 --> 00:28:45.531
(Nex Beer)

473
00:28:48.102 --> 00:28:50.471
- You have to kick it properly. - Just eat.

474
00:28:50.842 --> 00:28:52.672
Hey, kids.

475
00:28:54.572 --> 00:28:57.041
Trash belongs in the trash can.

476
00:28:57.041 --> 00:28:58.481
You sound like my dad.

477
00:28:58.941 --> 00:29:00.481
Who are you to get involved?

478
00:29:01.812 --> 00:29:04.181
Just let them be. They're not going to listen.

479
00:29:04.181 --> 00:29:05.322
Let's just go.

480
00:29:11.662 --> 00:29:12.721
What are you doing?

481
00:29:13.461 --> 00:29:15.662
- Kids. - What are you doing?

482
00:29:15.991 --> 00:29:17.761
Don't film us!

483
00:29:17.862 --> 00:29:20.701
Who do you think you are?

484
00:29:21.001 --> 00:29:22.941
Me? I'm an adult.

485
00:29:24.872 --> 00:29:26.912
You're like an annoying uncle.

486
00:29:27.041 --> 00:29:28.771
Gosh, I can't take this anymore.

487
00:29:28.771 --> 00:29:30.211
Let's just go already.

488
00:29:31.312 --> 00:29:33.011
Hey, just get lost.

489
00:29:33.412 --> 00:29:34.412
Okay?

490
00:29:35.582 --> 00:29:39.281
Kids, just pick up your trash and throw it in the trash can.

491
00:29:39.552 --> 00:29:42.052
Let's give this video a nice ending.

492
00:29:42.822 --> 00:29:44.392
What's his problem?

493
00:29:45.622 --> 00:29:47.392
- What are you doing? - Hey.

494
00:29:49.062 --> 00:29:50.261
"Kim Ho Jin".

495
00:29:50.602 --> 00:29:52.931
- "Yoon Nam Joon." - Stop filming us!

496
00:29:53.471 --> 00:29:54.471
Give it!

497
00:29:54.672 --> 00:29:56.672
- Grab him! - Get his cell phone!

498
00:29:56.842 --> 00:29:59.041
You punks! Soo Chul!

499
00:30:06.612 --> 00:30:07.652
Soo Chul!

500
00:30:08.112 --> 00:30:09.181
Soo Chul!

501
00:30:09.681 --> 00:30:11.352
- Oh, my back. - Are you okay?

502
00:30:13.291 --> 00:30:14.291
I'm sorry.

503
00:30:16.291 --> 00:30:17.592
Are you okay?

504
00:30:20.791 --> 00:30:23.001
I heard your first son got married.

505
00:30:23.602 --> 00:30:25.132
I didn't know about the wedding.

506
00:30:25.662 --> 00:30:27.802
Didn't I send you a big sum of congratulatory money?

507
00:30:28.531 --> 00:30:31.302
Yes, it's fine. But what about your second son?

508
00:30:32.271 --> 00:30:34.642
Oh, he's married already?

509
00:30:35.372 --> 00:30:38.281
Your eldest son, the math teacher.

510
00:30:39.342 --> 00:30:41.912
Did he get a divorce by any chance?

511
00:30:42.981 --> 00:30:44.221
No?

512
00:30:44.622 --> 00:30:46.291
(Jong Gu's mother, Hair salon...)

513
00:30:46.291 --> 00:30:48.751
My gosh, when did I ever reject your son?

514
00:30:48.751 --> 00:30:50.362
I said we should set them up once he gets a job.

515
00:30:51.892 --> 00:30:53.132
He's still jobless?

516
00:30:53.362 --> 00:30:55.761
(Jong Gu's mother, Hair salon...)

517
00:30:56.862 --> 00:30:58.031
My gosh, there's no one.

518
00:31:20.852 --> 00:31:22.251
What can I help you with?

519
00:31:24.062 --> 00:31:27.392
I'd like you to help me...

520
00:31:27.691 --> 00:31:31.102
do something for my daughter.

521
00:31:32.062 --> 00:31:34.731
- Pardon? - I have a lot of money.

522
00:31:35.931 --> 00:31:38.471
So I'm thinking of making a savings account...

523
00:31:38.471 --> 00:31:40.471
or invest in some mutual funds for her.

524
00:31:41.112 --> 00:31:42.572
Let me take a look.

525
00:31:47.281 --> 00:31:48.912
You have a great first impression.

526
00:31:49.922 --> 00:31:51.052
Are you married?

527
00:31:51.251 --> 00:31:52.521
No, not yet.

528
00:31:54.092 --> 00:31:55.221
Is that so?

529
00:31:58.221 --> 00:32:00.562
Hello? Diapers?

530
00:32:01.261 --> 00:32:02.731
Okay. See you.

531
00:32:05.501 --> 00:32:06.802
You must have a niece or a nephew.

532
00:32:07.872 --> 00:32:09.001
I have a son.

533
00:32:10.241 --> 00:32:12.941
My wife gave birth before we could get married.

534
00:32:16.172 --> 00:32:17.781
There's an investment that will guarantee a high profit.

535
00:32:17.941 --> 00:32:19.142
Are you interested?

536
00:32:20.552 --> 00:32:23.451
No, my business here is done.

537
00:32:24.681 --> 00:32:27.251
One. And then,

538
00:32:27.251 --> 00:32:28.691
two.

539
00:32:29.251 --> 00:32:31.122
3, 4.

540
00:32:31.461 --> 00:32:34.931
1, 2, 3, 4.

541
00:32:35.531 --> 00:32:37.862
- 1, 2, - He's not...

542
00:32:38.731 --> 00:32:40.072
- 3, 4. - so bad.

- 3, 4. - Or maybe I'm wrong.

545
00:32:46.541 --> 00:32:50.041
Okay, that's it for today. Great job, everyone.

548
00:32:59.751 --> 00:33:00.791
Excuse...

549
00:33:06.322 --> 00:33:10.031
- The thing is, my daughter... - Yes, ma'am?

550
00:33:11.302 --> 00:33:12.402
I'm sorry.

551
00:33:29.552 --> 00:33:30.622
My goodness.

552
00:33:31.622 --> 00:33:34.991
Who are all these men married to?

553
00:33:45.731 --> 00:33:46.932
When did I get a text?

554
00:33:50.501 --> 00:33:52.472
Tomorrow is the day you receive your gastroscopy.

555
00:33:55.072 --> 00:33:56.371
It's been three months already?

556
00:34:00.612 --> 00:34:02.851
My gosh, you guys still have a lot of work to do.

557
00:34:03.121 --> 00:34:06.251
No, we're almost done. Why did you want the magazines?

558
00:34:06.251 --> 00:34:07.691
What's the use of keeping them all piled up?

559
00:34:07.691 --> 00:34:09.222
We can send them to community service centers...

560
00:34:09.222 --> 00:34:10.461
and postnatal care centers.

561
00:34:10.762 --> 00:34:12.161
So Yoon, write up a list for me.

562
00:34:12.161 --> 00:34:13.191
Sure.

563
00:34:14.161 --> 00:34:16.132
We might end up giving too much away.

564
00:34:16.802 --> 00:34:19.402
What do we do? They can't spare an extra vehicle.

565
00:34:19.461 --> 00:34:20.601
They don't have any extras.

566
00:34:21.231 --> 00:34:24.172
- Why not? - Due to waned photoshoots.

567
00:34:24.402 --> 00:34:26.371
The magazine isn't as thick as it used to be.

568
00:34:26.641 --> 00:34:28.411
We'll transport these ourselves.

569
00:34:28.711 --> 00:34:29.882
Who's bringing their car tomorrow?

570
00:34:30.911 --> 00:34:33.041
My husband took the car for his business trip.

571
00:34:33.251 --> 00:34:35.652
Mine is at the auto shop.

572
00:34:36.182 --> 00:34:38.152
Then I'll drive my dad's car to work tomorrow.

573
00:34:39.121 --> 00:34:40.222
You have a license?

574
00:34:40.492 --> 00:34:42.922
Yes, but I haven't been on the road yet.

575
00:34:46.532 --> 00:34:47.762
Who's the photographer tomorrow?

576
00:34:50.762 --> 00:34:52.302
Can't we call in a favor?

577
00:35:01.771 --> 00:35:02.771
So...

578
00:35:03.742 --> 00:35:05.981
he's the reason why your arm is busted?

579
00:35:07.581 --> 00:35:10.021
Well, it at least...

580
00:35:10.621 --> 00:35:12.751
I taught the kids to throw away trash...

581
00:35:13.391 --> 00:35:14.751
in trash cans.

582
00:35:15.021 --> 00:35:16.422
You...

583
00:35:16.661 --> 00:35:19.961
are a grown-up who takes his responsibilities seriously.

584
00:35:19.961 --> 00:35:20.992
Right?

585
00:35:32.101 --> 00:35:34.041
So tell me about tomorrow's photoshoot.

586
00:35:35.742 --> 00:35:37.342
You'll be taking photos of the event.

587
00:35:38.282 --> 00:35:40.012
Is this not something you want to do?

588
00:35:40.652 --> 00:35:43.382
All I'm doing is taking photos of an event.

589
00:35:43.382 --> 00:35:44.851
What's there to like or hate?

590
00:35:45.652 --> 00:35:49.052
I'm just flustered to work with "The Baby" again.

591
00:35:49.251 --> 00:35:52.691
Why do you guys always need so many little favors?

592
00:35:53.061 --> 00:35:56.092
I hate it when professional relationships get blurry.

593
00:35:56.492 --> 00:35:59.762
Aren't we close enough now for me to ask these...

594
00:35:59.762 --> 00:36:00.871
little friendly favors?

595
00:36:02.202 --> 00:36:03.302
Are we?

596
00:36:03.771 --> 00:36:06.072
I thought you didn't want to even look at me anymore.

597
00:36:06.141 --> 00:36:07.541
You're unbelievable.

598
00:36:07.871 --> 00:36:10.282
You took me in your arms when I cried the last time.

599
00:36:10.612 --> 00:36:12.382
Why do that when we're not even close?

600
00:36:14.152 --> 00:36:17.021
When did I take you in my arms?

601
00:36:17.021 --> 00:36:19.952
All I did was pat you on the back while you cried.

602
00:36:21.791 --> 00:36:24.161
I went from hating you to liking you which is even scarier,

603
00:36:24.691 --> 00:36:26.262
but I guess the feeling wasn't mutual.

604
00:36:27.161 --> 00:36:28.291
Only I thought we were friends.

00:37:01.891 --> 00:37:03.362
How about I sing a song?

612
00:37:03.461 --> 00:37:05.831
I'd rather you make some phone calls instead.

613
00:37:06.132 --> 00:37:07.172

My gosh, you're here!

615
00:37:13.871 --> 00:37:16.211
Guys, what took you so long?

616
00:37:16.211 --> 00:37:18.382
Let me show you to your seats. The others aren't here yet.

617
00:37:18.811 --> 00:37:20.652
The other moms won't be here.

618
00:37:23.382 --> 00:37:25.121
We came here to tell you where we stand.

619
00:37:30.161 --> 00:37:31.621
- What do you mean? - You're her, right?

620

The woman who tried to buy sperm illegally.

621
00:37:38.202 --> 00:37:39.862
How can a journalist for a baby magazine...

622
00:37:39.862 --> 00:37:42.001
do such a thing? It's unethical.

623
00:37:42.202 --> 00:37:43.402
We can't support the magazine...

624
00:37:43.402 --> 00:37:45.871
when its journalist has questionable morals.

625
00:37:47.112 --> 00:37:48.612
I thought...

626
00:37:49.672 --> 00:37:53.311
that the moms would understand...

627
00:37:53.411 --> 00:37:55.481
my desire to become a mom.

628
00:37:55.581 --> 00:37:57.021
It's why we're taking a stand.

629
00:37:57.382 --> 00:37:59.552
We want children to be raised in an upright environment.

630
00:37:59.981 --> 00:38:01.452
We are aware that there are women...

631
00:38:01.452 --> 00:38:03.322
who wish to raise children while still unmarried.

632
00:38:03.322 --> 00:38:06.191
But what about the children who will grow up without a father?

633
00:38:06.461 --> 00:38:07.961
Children aren't toys, you know.

634
00:38:07.992 --> 00:38:09.731
Giving birth just because you want to...

635
00:38:10.601 --> 00:38:11.802
is selfish if you ask me.

636
00:38:12.862 --> 00:38:14.972
How could you do this to your own child?

637
00:38:15.302 --> 00:38:18.141
If you want a family, try getting a dog or a cat instead.

638
00:38:22.842 --> 00:38:23.911
Look here, ladies!

639
00:38:25.512 --> 00:38:27.052
Get a dog instead?

640
00:38:27.112 --> 00:38:29.311
How could you say that to dog lovers?

641
00:38:29.851 --> 00:38:32.882
- Mind your own business. - The dog lover in me can't take it.

642
00:38:33.322 --> 00:38:34.922
It's not your call...

643
00:38:34.922 --> 00:38:36.862
whether or not she raises a dog or a baby.

644
00:38:36.992 --> 00:38:39.862
What did Ms. Jang do anyway? She did nothing wrong.

645
00:38:48.101 --> 00:38:50.902
I apologize for making you all uncomfortable.

646
00:38:53.172 --> 00:38:55.271
I understand your worries...

647
00:38:56.441 --> 00:38:58.911
and you can say that being moms yourselves.

648
00:38:59.811 --> 00:39:00.811
However,

649
00:39:01.682 --> 00:39:04.652
it wasn't my intention to do what you're thinking.

650
00:39:12.791 --> 00:39:15.061
I've been working alongside moms for 15 years,

651
00:39:16.862 --> 00:39:19.302
so I thought I knew how moms would feel.

652
00:39:20.972 --> 00:39:22.101
But I guess...

653
00:39:23.441 --> 00:39:25.601
I was clueless after all.

654
00:39:27.512 --> 00:39:30.512
I wish to learn how it's like to be a mom...

655
00:39:31.182 --> 00:39:32.382
and understand motherhood.

656
00:39:34.481 --> 00:39:37.481
I truly hope I get the chance.

657
00:39:43.992 --> 00:39:46.291
Hold on. Stop that.

658
00:39:47.032 --> 00:39:50.231
What do you mean our supporters declared a boycott?

659
00:39:51.032 --> 00:39:52.302
Where's Ms. Jang?

660
00:39:53.532 --> 00:39:55.202
I ordered her to clean up storage.

661
00:39:55.532 --> 00:39:57.242
We're about to call it a day, so you should talk to her tomorrow.

662
00:39:57.541 --> 00:40:00.941
Ms. Shim, this isn't something you should defend her on.

663
00:40:02.242 --> 00:40:04.911
Goodness. I didn't know I had the power to do that.

664
00:40:05.012 --> 00:40:07.411
I want her in my office as soon as...

665
00:40:07.851 --> 00:40:09.012
she gets to work tomorrow.

666
00:40:11.652 --> 00:40:12.682
Got it?

00:40:13.552 --> 00:40:14.592

Thank you.

674
00:41:18.366 --> 00:41:19.727
Why were you out looking for me?

675
00:41:20.696 --> 00:41:23.096
Did you think I'd be crying like a kid?

676
00:41:23.906 --> 00:41:25.636
Were you hoping to pat me on the back again?

677
00:41:26.667 --> 00:41:28.437
It's because I needed a drinking buddy.

678
00:41:33.377 --> 00:41:35.017
I have a lot on my mind today.

679
00:41:45.857 --> 00:41:47.296
Why did you lie?

680
00:41:49.696 --> 00:41:51.026
You don't raise dogs.

681
00:41:51.926 --> 00:41:52.926
How did you know that?

682
00:41:53.026 --> 00:41:54.736
You would've already talked about your dog if you had one.

00:41:55.096 --> 00:41:57.236
My Ddol Ddol was clever, you know.

684

If only it came back after running away 30 years ago.

685
00:42:14.656 --> 00:42:17.826
Will the moms ever understand me?

686
00:42:22.727 --> 00:42:24.526
My parents always argued...

687
00:42:25.026 --> 00:42:26.897
during mealtime.

688
00:42:27.897 --> 00:42:30.667
My dad had to have a cup of water before eating,

689
00:42:31.506 --> 00:42:34.337
but my mom would say that it'll hinder his digestion.

690
00:42:35.477 --> 00:42:36.837
After my father passed away,

691
00:42:36.837 --> 00:42:39.607
she has always served water during his ancestral rite.

692
00:42:40.477 --> 00:42:43.247
She does that even after saying how she couldn't understand...

693
00:42:43.986 --> 00:42:46.116
why he'd do such a thing for 40 years.

694
00:42:52.557 --> 00:42:56.196
One must not understand at first to understand.

695
00:43:01.897 --> 00:43:04.837
If you finally understand someone at one point in your life,

696
00:43:05.667 --> 00:43:07.437
it'll mean that...

697
00:43:07.807 --> 00:43:10.236
you've been thinking about that person throughout that time.

698
00:43:10.477 --> 00:43:13.276
It's a human being, who can't even understand himself,

699
00:43:14.216 --> 00:43:15.546
understanding someone else.

700
00:43:17.187 --> 00:43:19.147
And if you really do understand,

701
00:43:20.756 --> 00:43:22.017
your attitude would change.

702
00:43:23.687 --> 00:43:25.426
Although it shouldn't take 40 years.

703
00:43:33.067 --> 00:43:34.067
Why did you come?

704
00:43:35.167 --> 00:43:36.937
I may need to be carried home today.

705
00:43:40.107 --> 00:43:41.377
I have a wide back.

706
00:43:41.537 --> 00:43:42.676
It'll be comfortable.

707
00:43:44.906 --> 00:43:46.046
I don't know about that.

708
00:43:47.247 --> 00:43:48.477

709
00:43:59.287 --> 00:44:01.156

Mr. Average Person,

714
00:44:13.466 --> 00:44:16.107
will you continue to stay single?

715
00:44:16.937 --> 00:44:19.346
You seem like a pretty good guy.

716
00:44:20.747 --> 00:44:23.176
I wonder if you plan to stay single.

717
00:44:24.886 --> 00:44:26.087
I don't want to get excited.

718
00:44:28.187 --> 00:44:30.857
Depending on someone and being disappointed,

719
00:44:31.627 --> 00:44:34.557
hurt, and then liking them...

720
00:44:35.997 --> 00:44:38.026
I can't handle being excited in love anymore.

721
00:44:39.767 --> 00:44:43.466
If I fall after the age of 40, life won't be so kind.

722
00:44:45.037 --> 00:44:46.837
I want to live as I do now.

723
00:44:48.736 --> 00:44:50.176
Silently.

724
00:44:52.307 --> 00:44:53.446
Without any happenings.

725
00:45:13.397 --> 00:45:14.596
But...

726
00:45:18.037 --> 00:45:20.307
why do you want to be a mom?

727
00:45:22.576 --> 00:45:23.707
I just...

728
00:45:27.076 --> 00:45:29.176
want to become happy.

729
00:45:51.307 --> 00:45:54.707
You are very devoted to the company.

730
00:45:55.176 --> 00:45:57.877
You did some incredible PR for the magazine.

731
00:45:58.107 --> 00:46:01.477
I hear you turned the mom community upside down.

732
00:46:02.477 --> 00:46:04.386
She said she was investigating undercover,

733
00:46:04.386 --> 00:46:06.986
so we should write an article saying that...

734
00:46:06.986 --> 00:46:08.256
to fix the situation.

735
00:46:08.756 --> 00:46:12.627
She told the readers that she wants to have a baby!

736
00:46:13.457 --> 00:46:15.256
- Yes, sir. - If we're going to play along,

737
00:46:15.256 --> 00:46:16.557
we need to get our stories straight.

738
00:46:16.557 --> 00:46:17.596
Yes, we do.

739
00:46:19.196 --> 00:46:21.937
- I'll do what I can to fix... - Stay out of it!

740
00:46:21.937 --> 00:46:23.096
Yes, sir.

741
00:46:23.096 --> 00:46:25.736
You have no kids, so you can't figure out the readers' needs.

742
00:46:25.966 --> 00:46:29.406
Even if you do well, I don't know about making you editor-in-chief.

743
00:46:29.707 --> 00:46:31.176
All you do is make trouble.

744
00:46:32.076 --> 00:46:34.176
That's why I plan to have a baby...

745
00:46:37.546 --> 00:46:41.187
I knew from the get-go that you were an imbecile,

746
00:46:41.687 --> 00:46:44.026
but I didn't know it was that bad.

747
00:46:45.326 --> 00:46:47.656
We're going to hold a disciplinary hearing.

748
00:46:48.627 --> 00:46:51.366
It's the first time in 30 years since we started,

749
00:46:51.526 --> 00:46:53.026
so it won't be easy.

750
00:46:53.767 --> 00:46:56.897
Given the situation, we will be very stern.

751
00:47:00.937 --> 00:47:01.977
I'm sorry.

752
00:47:02.736 --> 00:47:04.946
It was wrong to tarnish the company's image.

753
00:47:05.207 --> 00:47:07.346
But strictly put, it's your personal life.

754
00:47:07.647 --> 00:47:10.517
It's not like they'll take care of your life. Those schmucks.

755
00:47:12.986 --> 00:47:13.986
Excuse me.

756
00:47:17.326 --> 00:47:18.326
Hello?

757
00:47:18.426 --> 00:47:20.026
Are you Lee Ok Ran's guardian?

758
00:47:20.127 --> 00:47:21.656
This is Big Hospital.

759
00:47:21.857 --> 00:47:24.296
Why aren't you coming. We can't discharge her without you.

760
00:47:25.366 --> 00:47:26.397
Excuse me?

761
00:47:33.636 --> 00:47:35.537
Lee Ok Ran's guardian.

762
00:47:36.136 --> 00:47:38.576
- Yes. - She's still sleeping.

763
00:47:38.676 --> 00:47:41.346
Wait here. We'll let you know when she's out.

764
00:47:41.346 --> 00:47:43.076
- Okay. Thank you. - Sure.

765
00:47:49.756 --> 00:47:51.526
Park Shi Ta's guardian.

766
00:48:09.136 --> 00:48:10.176
Okay.

767
00:48:12.176 --> 00:48:13.406
Hello.

768
00:48:13.807 --> 00:48:15.046
I'm here for my baby's vaccination shot.

769
00:48:15.046 --> 00:48:16.676
Okay. Wait here.

770
00:48:16.676 --> 00:48:17.787
Okay.

771
00:48:18.386 --> 00:48:20.017
Ha Ri. Where are we?

772
00:48:20.486 --> 00:48:21.817
You're so sweet.

773
00:48:26.256 --> 00:48:28.127
It's a sad realization.

774
00:48:30.156 --> 00:48:31.227
Sit here.

775
00:48:33.596 --> 00:48:34.736
Are you okay?

776
00:48:34.736 --> 00:48:36.397
It's okay.

777
00:48:36.897 --> 00:48:39.307
Even as I saw the growing wrinkles on Mom's face,

778
00:48:45.546 --> 00:48:47.917
I was indifferent and only counted my age.

779
00:48:54.057 --> 00:48:56.256
- Jang Ha Ri's guardian? - Yes, me. Me.

780
00:48:58.026 --> 00:49:00.557
Oh no. How did this happen?

781
00:49:00.656 --> 00:49:02.796
Oh no. You poor thing.

782
00:49:03.426 --> 00:49:04.997
Because a Mom is a Mom,

783
00:49:07.067 --> 00:49:09.337
I always expected to depend on her.

784
00:49:10.466 --> 00:49:11.667
Does it hurt?

785
00:49:17.977 --> 00:49:21.046
Why did I take it for granted that she was my guardian?

786
00:49:25.486 --> 00:49:27.587
- Lee Ok Ran's guardian. - Yes.

787
00:49:28.156 --> 00:49:29.386
- Okay. - Mom.

788
00:49:32.627 --> 00:49:33.627
- Thank you. - Goodbye.

789
00:49:35.026 --> 00:49:36.127
Are you okay?

790
00:49:36.696 --> 00:49:37.727
Yes.

791
00:49:41.067 --> 00:49:42.537
That moment always comes...

792
00:49:42.866 --> 00:49:45.906
when the child becomes their parent's guardian.

793
00:49:50.676 --> 00:49:51.846
At...

794
00:49:54.247 --> 00:49:55.317
that moment,

795
00:49:57.687 --> 00:49:59.647
we have no choice but to become adults.

796
00:50:22.406 --> 00:50:25.307
Did you two go somewhere nice?

797
00:50:25.647 --> 00:50:26.807
Goodness.

798
00:50:37.057 --> 00:50:38.227
So...

799
00:50:38.587 --> 00:50:41.857
They let me go alone last time. That's why I went alone.

800
00:50:42.457 --> 00:50:44.426
I didn't know the hospital changed its policy.

801
00:50:44.926 --> 00:50:47.767
Why would you go to the hospital alone like you have no family?

802
00:50:49.366 --> 00:50:51.537
I'm the only one who didn't know you had stomach cancer.

803
00:50:52.037 --> 00:50:55.276
I get a call on the day of the surgery as if it's a picnic.

804
00:50:55.477 --> 00:50:56.506
How...

805
00:51:00.546 --> 00:51:02.477
You shouldn't do that to your daughter.

806
00:51:03.647 --> 00:51:05.546
Why are you making me a bad daughter?

807
00:51:06.446 --> 00:51:07.857
Did someone say you were bad?

808
00:51:08.156 --> 00:51:11.587
Everyone knows you work long hours and can't even come home.

809
00:51:13.057 --> 00:51:15.357
Don't mind me, and focus on your job.

810
00:51:15.357 --> 00:51:17.397
How can I not mind you when you're sick?

811
00:51:17.397 --> 00:51:20.026
I'm not sick. They said I'm fine.

812
00:51:20.397 --> 00:51:23.267
You should eat and sleep properly as you work.

813
00:51:25.937 --> 00:51:30.337
I... I'm always making you worry about me.

814
00:51:34.317 --> 00:51:35.946
Can't I worry about you too?

815
00:51:41.057 --> 00:51:44.127
Even if I act immature,

816
00:51:44.457 --> 00:51:48.026
I can take care of you, so have faith in your daughter.

817
00:51:52.267 --> 00:51:55.537
Why would you take care of me? I'm not terminally ill.

818
00:51:56.767 --> 00:51:59.466
Save your nagging for your kids.

819
00:51:59.866 --> 00:52:02.776
Get sperm or whatever. Have kids using whatever means you want.

820
00:52:02.776 --> 00:52:04.006
It's so annoying.

821
00:52:06.406 --> 00:52:07.647
No, that's...

822
00:52:16.057 --> 00:52:18.256
I thought I could raise a baby well,

823
00:52:20.926 --> 00:52:23.426
but I didn't think about the child who'd have to live without a dad.

824
00:52:28.567 --> 00:52:29.767
I was being greedy.

825
00:52:34.477 --> 00:52:35.636
I mean,

826
00:52:36.307 --> 00:52:39.006
I was fine although I only had you, so...

827
00:52:47.386 --> 00:52:49.317
I thought I could do well.

828
00:52:52.057 --> 00:52:53.787
But I should've thought about the kid first.

829
00:52:57.596 --> 00:52:59.127
I don't think I'm qualified.

830
00:53:04.667 --> 00:53:05.966
Did someone say something?

831
00:53:06.267 --> 00:53:07.366
No.

832
00:53:09.906 --> 00:53:10.946
My gosh.

833
00:53:11.607 --> 00:53:14.076
Parents have kids because they want to.

834
00:53:15.247 --> 00:53:18.346
No baby is born out of their own will.

835
00:53:18.346 --> 00:53:22.087
Do you think I gave birth to you because you begged me to?

836
00:53:22.287 --> 00:53:24.156
What kind of nonsense are you talking about?

837
00:53:26.727 --> 00:53:28.857
You don't study and take tests to become a mother.

838
00:53:28.857 --> 00:53:30.826
You become a mother after you give birth.

839
00:53:31.497 --> 00:53:34.196
There's no license for that. Don't say you're not qualified.

840
00:53:35.997 --> 00:53:37.636
You're right. There's no license.

841
00:53:38.837 --> 00:53:41.906
But if there was a license test for that,

842
00:53:42.076 --> 00:53:43.076
you'd get the highest score.

843
00:53:43.076 --> 00:53:45.906
So be good to your mom.

844
00:53:46.207 --> 00:53:48.377
Anyway, I don't think this was a fight.

845
00:53:48.377 --> 00:53:51.846
It was really nice to watch you guys reconcile and make peace.

846
00:53:51.986 --> 00:53:55.216
Do Ah is crying. I'll leave you guys to wrap it up. I love you guys.

847
00:53:55.656 --> 00:53:56.756
Do Ah.

848
00:53:58.386 --> 00:54:00.026
What was that? My gosh.

849
00:54:31.986 --> 00:54:34.426
Aren't you going to drink? Let's have a drink.

850
00:54:34.727 --> 00:54:36.957
No, I don't want to become an alcoholic like you.

851
00:54:36.957 --> 00:54:38.426
I'll sue you for slander.

852
00:54:38.627 --> 00:54:39.727
Don't do that.

853
00:54:40.627 --> 00:54:42.397
I'm sick of getting punished.

854
00:54:43.667 --> 00:54:45.107
Are you serious?

855
00:54:46.537 --> 00:54:47.776
What can you do?

856
00:54:47.877 --> 00:54:49.576
You're just going through...

857
00:54:49.937 --> 00:54:52.107
the adversities and hardships of becoming a mom.

858
00:54:55.776 --> 00:54:58.346
Come to think of it, even you didn't ask.

859
00:54:59.486 --> 00:55:00.486
What?

860
00:55:01.017 --> 00:55:04.557
No one asked me why, but I Sang did.

861
00:55:07.557 --> 00:55:09.426
He asked me why I want to become a mom.

862
00:55:12.466 --> 00:55:14.736
What other reason could there be?

863
00:55:15.596 --> 00:55:17.667
You want to become a mom because of your motherly instincts.

864
00:55:18.307 --> 00:55:21.837
Yes, you're right.

865
00:55:24.707 --> 00:55:28.647
But on my way home, I suddenly remembered...

866
00:55:30.647 --> 00:55:32.486
my elementary school graduation day.

867
00:55:36.886 --> 00:55:39.057
Don't be a scrooge and just get her a big bouquet.

868
00:55:39.156 --> 00:55:40.526
And take a lot of photos.

869
00:55:45.926 --> 00:55:48.366
Don't go anywhere else, okay? If you do, I'll get really angry.

870
00:55:48.997 --> 00:55:50.267
Okay.

871
00:55:58.247 --> 00:56:01.046
Dad, get me a big bouquet of roses.

872
00:56:01.216 --> 00:56:02.276
Okay.

873
00:56:06.546 --> 00:56:09.017
Ha Ri, I need to get a film...

874
00:56:09.017 --> 00:56:11.227
for the camera.

875
00:56:11.227 --> 00:56:12.287
You should go without me.

876
00:56:12.886 --> 00:56:14.957
- Do you know which class I'm in? - What?

877
00:56:15.326 --> 00:56:17.526
I'm in class 6-5. It's on the 4th floor.

878
00:56:18.096 --> 00:56:19.426
Can you find your way there?

879
00:56:19.796 --> 00:56:20.826
Of course.

880
00:56:21.397 --> 00:56:23.366
You go first. I'll be right there.

881
00:56:28.576 --> 00:56:29.707
Wait for me!

882
00:56:40.946 --> 00:56:44.357
(Ssanggang Elementary School, 23rd Graduation Ceremony)

883
00:56:44.357 --> 00:56:46.787
(Congratulations on your graduation)

884
00:56:46.787 --> 00:56:48.296
No matter how long I waited,

885
00:56:49.926 --> 00:56:51.497
my dad didn't show up.

886
00:56:52.466 --> 00:56:54.267
I was the only one standing there all by myself,

887
00:56:55.067 --> 00:56:58.207
and I was embarrassed because it felt like all eyes were on me.

888
00:57:00.067 --> 00:57:02.006
But I couldn't go home.

889
00:57:04.846 --> 00:57:07.977
Because I knew my dad won't ever come back.

890
00:57:12.087 --> 00:57:14.917
Ha Ri, what are you doing here?

891
00:57:15.156 --> 00:57:16.256
Where is your dad?

892
00:57:17.357 --> 00:57:18.386
I don't know.

893
00:57:25.426 --> 00:57:28.167
Ha Ri, let's take a photo together. Come here.

894
00:57:30.096 --> 00:57:31.207
Why?

895
00:57:31.207 --> 00:57:32.567
- Stand there. - You guys are friends.

896
00:57:33.167 --> 00:57:34.707
Smile.

897
00:57:34.776 --> 00:57:36.576
- 1, 2, 3. - 1, 2, 3.

898
00:57:38.276 --> 00:57:40.807
Let's take one more photo. Give me a bright smile.

899
00:57:40.807 --> 00:57:43.076
You look really ugly right now.

900
00:57:43.477 --> 00:57:44.486
Why you...

901
00:57:45.886 --> 00:57:47.817
- Oh, gosh! - No, wait!

902
00:57:48.216 --> 00:57:49.386
Ha Ri, stop.

903
00:57:49.386 --> 00:57:52.057
- What's the matter? - Stop it.

904
00:57:52.057 --> 00:57:53.857
- Stop it, Jae Young. - Ha Ri.

905
00:57:53.886 --> 00:57:56.397
My goodness, what did you say?

906
00:57:56.397 --> 00:57:58.026
Jae Young, stop it.

907
00:58:01.796 --> 00:58:04.537
(Pig Skin)

908
00:58:07.837 --> 00:58:09.576
- Mom. - Oh, dear.

909
00:58:11.276 --> 00:58:12.307
Ha Ri, what's wrong?

910
00:58:12.906 --> 00:58:14.616
Mom!

911
00:58:14.716 --> 00:58:15.716
Where's your dad?

912
00:58:23.187 --> 00:58:24.216
Is it yummy?

913
00:58:24.986 --> 00:58:26.026
Yes.

914
00:58:28.826 --> 00:58:30.426
It's all over your mouth.

915
00:58:35.067 --> 00:58:36.466
You're okay without your dad, right?

916
00:58:41.906 --> 00:58:42.977
Yes.

917
00:58:45.946 --> 00:58:46.977
Eat some meat.

918
00:58:54.116 --> 00:58:56.486
That's when I promised myself to become an awesome person...

919
00:58:57.087 --> 00:58:58.656
when I grow up.

920
00:58:59.557 --> 00:59:01.397
What kind of an awesome person?

921
00:59:03.256 --> 00:59:04.296
A mom.

922
00:59:10.167 --> 00:59:12.937
My mom is the most awesome person in the world.

923
00:59:20.247 --> 00:59:21.346
A mother.

924
01:00:09.426 --> 01:00:11.627
They'll probably cut her wage for about 1 to 3 months.

925
01:00:13.727 --> 01:00:14.866
Do you think this is fun?

926
01:00:15.897 --> 01:00:17.136
No, I'm worried.

927
01:00:17.437 --> 01:00:20.906
The worst thing that can happen to an employee is not getting paid.

928
01:00:21.807 --> 01:00:24.377
Did she really make such a big mistake?

929
01:00:25.546 --> 01:00:28.377
She tarnished the company's reputation and credibility.

930
01:00:30.377 --> 01:00:33.317
I should've just quietly dealt with those mothers.

931
01:00:41.357 --> 01:00:42.357
What happened?

932
01:00:44.826 --> 01:00:46.167
They suspended her for a month.

933
01:00:46.466 --> 01:00:47.497
- What? - What?

934
01:00:48.667 --> 01:00:51.296
Then she won't get paid for a month?

935
01:00:51.406 --> 01:00:53.267
This is unbelievable.

936
01:00:53.267 --> 01:00:55.037
They can't suspend her for this.

937
01:00:55.307 --> 01:00:57.307
How are we going to meet the deadline for our project?

938
01:00:58.006 --> 01:00:59.207
Where is Ha Ri?

939
01:01:01.817 --> 01:01:03.017
Hey, Ha Ri.

940
01:01:05.017 --> 01:01:06.687
I heard what happened.

941
01:01:07.346 --> 01:01:10.787
Hey... Ha Ri, I'll... I'll see you.

942
01:01:14.587 --> 01:01:17.457
She got suspended for a month.

943
01:01:18.296 --> 01:01:19.897
She looks really angry, doesn't she?

944
01:01:45.756 --> 01:01:47.227
This game is for two people. You can't play it by yourself.

945
01:01:56.196 --> 01:01:57.736
Let's do this.

946
01:02:03.377 --> 01:02:04.537
Over there.

947
01:02:05.607 --> 01:02:07.076
To your left!

948
01:02:07.747 --> 01:02:09.247
This is hard.

949
01:02:09.247 --> 01:02:10.517
Shoot!

950
01:02:10.517 --> 01:02:12.687
You were supposed to shoot that.

951
01:02:13.346 --> 01:02:14.346
My gosh, no!

952
01:02:17.986 --> 01:02:19.026
(You Lose)

953
01:02:23.357 --> 01:02:25.497
You acted like a natural, so I thought you'd be a sniper.

954
01:02:27.196 --> 01:02:28.236
What next?

955
01:02:30.037 --> 01:02:32.906
Should we drink or go to the beach?

956
01:02:36.136 --> 01:02:38.247
I'm no longer stressed.

957
01:02:39.006 --> 01:02:40.276
I may have gotten suspended,

958
01:02:41.076 --> 01:02:42.247
but I still need to meet a deadline.

959
01:02:52.957 --> 01:02:54.926
This is fun, right?

960
01:02:55.326 --> 01:02:57.656
Let me see you smile!

961
01:02:57.926 --> 01:02:59.667
Over here! Look!

962
01:02:59.926 --> 01:03:01.696
Give me a smile.

963
01:03:01.966 --> 01:03:04.096
Smile, Yu Bin. Look here, Yu Bin.

964
01:03:04.236 --> 01:03:05.307
Over here!

965
01:03:06.307 --> 01:03:07.807
Yu Bin, give me a smile! He's laughing too!

966
01:03:07.807 --> 01:03:09.636
Look! He's laughing too!

967
01:03:16.216 --> 01:03:18.017
Yes, let's laugh!

968
01:03:20.817 --> 01:03:23.256
There you go. All right.

969
01:03:25.687 --> 01:03:27.656
I need him to cry this time.

970
01:03:28.796 --> 01:03:29.857
What do I do?

971
01:03:30.857 --> 01:03:33.497
Yoo Bin, roar.

972
01:03:33.796 --> 01:03:35.497
Roar! I'm coming to get you.

973
01:03:37.196 --> 01:03:38.767
He is a very bad man.

974
01:03:38.837 --> 01:03:40.837
Look at me hit the bad man.

975
01:03:40.837 --> 01:03:42.136
How nasty!

976
01:03:44.676 --> 01:03:45.846
You naughty boy.

977
01:03:51.346 --> 01:03:52.417
You naughty boy!

978
01:03:58.426 --> 01:04:00.057
As if you stood a chance.

979
01:04:00.256 --> 01:04:01.526
That's what I call talent.

980
01:04:08.366 --> 01:04:10.537
- Can you check the photos? - Sure.

981
01:04:15.307 --> 01:04:16.576
Let's see.

982
01:04:19.147 --> 01:04:20.776
That one.

983
01:04:23.576 --> 01:04:24.846
They're all good.

984
01:04:25.046 --> 01:04:26.287
This should be the main photo.

985
01:04:27.216 --> 01:04:29.417
Mr. Han,

986
01:04:30.587 --> 01:04:31.727
I'm impressed.

987
01:04:39.826 --> 01:04:42.696
(Good job!)

988
01:04:46.667 --> 01:04:49.707
It's us grown-ups who really need compliments.

989
01:04:54.107 --> 01:04:55.346
Good job, Mr. Han.

990
01:04:56.747 --> 01:04:59.787
- Ha Ri, the baby's mom is leaving. - Okay.

991
01:05:01.346 --> 01:05:02.357
Goodbye.

992
01:05:02.357 --> 01:05:09.156
(Good job!)

993
01:05:44.727 --> 01:05:45.897
This is bad.

994
01:05:49.497 --> 01:05:54.866
(Good job!)

995
01:06:21.096 --> 01:06:23.667
(We thank Jang Gwang for his cameo appearance.)

996
01:06:42.017 --> 01:06:44.786
(Oh My Baby)

997
01:06:44.786 --> 01:06:46.327
You two were married?

998
01:06:46.687 --> 01:06:47.827
A second marriage?

999
01:06:47.827 --> 01:06:49.596
Right, the sperm donation.

1000
01:06:49.926 --> 01:06:53.067
I wouldn't have to be a father to your baby,

1001
01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.397
- so I'll do you a favor. - Really?

1002
01:06:55.397 --> 01:06:56.697
She's staying the night out?

1003
01:06:56.697 --> 01:06:58.166
Isn't she alone with Mr. Han?

1004
01:06:58.767 --> 01:07:02.636
You found the one place that only has one inn.

1005
01:07:02.636 --> 01:07:04.937
She'll get an earful from me once she gets back.

1006
01:07:05.046 --> 01:07:07.807
Is he the one that I shouldn't have let go of?

1007
01:07:08.147 --> 01:07:09.376
How should...

1008
01:07:11.477 --> 01:07:12.886
we spend the night?
