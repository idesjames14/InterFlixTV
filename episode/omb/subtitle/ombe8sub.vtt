1
00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:46.027
Gosh, I'm a complete mess.

2
00:00:47.527 --> 00:00:49.927
Is it because you want to impress me?

3
00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:51.567
My gosh.

4
00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:05.547
I also want to impress you, Ms. Jang.

5
00:01:06.577 --> 00:01:08.547
My goodness.

6
00:01:47.926 --> 00:01:49.357
Eu Ddeum, have you lost your mind?

7
00:01:50.657 --> 00:01:52.696
What... What? Why?

8
00:01:52.857 --> 00:01:54.456
You said you like me.

9
00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:55.767
And I like you, too.

10
00:01:55.767 --> 00:01:58.467
So I kissed you to help you muster up your courage.

11
00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:01.566
What in the world? I can't believe this darn punk.

12
00:02:02.336 --> 00:02:04.467
If you're drunk, you should go home...

13
00:02:04.467 --> 00:02:06.577
and just quietly go to bed.

14
00:02:06.937 --> 00:02:09.446
Hey! Get back here.

15
00:02:12.747 --> 00:02:13.777
I'm sorry!

16
00:02:23.127 --> 00:02:24.226
Unbelievable.

17
00:02:27.096 --> 00:02:29.797
What the... Are you kidding me?

18
00:02:38.937 --> 00:02:40.277
Unbelievable.

19
00:02:41.506 --> 00:02:43.277
This must be some joke.

20
00:02:45.446 --> 00:02:48.647
How dare he kiss me without my permission.

21
00:02:49.946 --> 00:02:52.386
I haven't been kissed for 10 years!

22
00:02:52.386 --> 00:02:53.717
10 years!

23
00:02:59.157 --> 00:03:00.627
Why does it feel like it's been less than 10?

24
00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:12.576
I felt very unpleasant afterward.

25
00:03:14.237 --> 00:03:15.846
- About what? - Don't you remember?

26
00:03:38.437 --> 00:03:40.467
What? My gosh!

27
00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:44.036
No way.

28
00:04:06.756 --> 00:04:08.766
Should I or shouldn't I read it?

29
00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:13.367
Only a jerk would read it, right?

30
00:04:14.367 --> 00:04:18.136
You wouldn't like it either if someone looked through your phone.

31
00:04:19.937 --> 00:04:21.036
How about a peek?

32
00:04:22.476 --> 00:04:23.606
Just a peek.

33
00:04:25.177 --> 00:04:26.976
I can, right?

34
00:04:28.617 --> 00:04:29.617
Let's take a look.

35
00:04:44.266 --> 00:04:47.666
(Potential sperm donor no. 3: Han I Sang)

36
00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:48.967
(Potential sperm donor no. 1: Choi Kang Eu Ddeum)

37
00:04:52.006 --> 00:04:53.237
(Potential sperm donor no. 1: Choi Kang Eu Ddeum)

38
00:04:53.237 --> 00:04:57.776
(Potential sperm donor no. 3: Han I Sang)

39
00:06:03.107 --> 00:06:06.247
Do Ah, have fun with your friends at daycare, okay?

40
00:06:06.747 --> 00:06:08.316
Off we go.

41
00:06:11.247 --> 00:06:13.357
- Are you off to work? - Yes.

42
00:06:13.716 --> 00:06:14.956
What are you up to this weekend?

43
00:06:15.057 --> 00:06:16.826
Can you help me with Do Ah's birthday party?

44
00:06:16.956 --> 00:06:19.196
I'm going to skip the party and just take photos.

45
00:06:19.456 --> 00:06:20.857
Could you introduce me...

46
00:06:21.057 --> 00:06:23.826
- to some good photo studios? - Sure.

47
00:06:25.237 --> 00:06:27.667
We'll go shopping and stop for a nice meal.

48
00:06:28.037 --> 00:06:30.636
Maybe your mom could babysit while we watch a movie.

49
00:06:30.636 --> 00:06:31.977
- Sure. - Really?

50
00:06:32.276 --> 00:06:33.276
There's no taking it back.

51
00:06:33.706 --> 00:06:35.177
What movie should we watch?

52
00:06:35.347 --> 00:06:37.847
A sweet romance movie sounds nice.

53
00:06:37.847 --> 00:06:38.847
Sure.

54
00:06:40.177 --> 00:06:41.516
- You don't hear me, do you? - Sure.

55
00:06:41.516 --> 00:06:42.946
- Ha Ri! - What the...

56
00:06:43.446 --> 00:06:45.086
What on earth is on your mind?

57
00:06:45.187 --> 00:06:47.086
Didn't I tell you that a troubling man isn't worth it?

58
00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:48.886
Don't even think about...

59
00:06:48.886 --> 00:06:50.857
having eyes for only one single man.

60
00:06:51.187 --> 00:06:52.526
Look around you...

61
00:06:52.526 --> 00:06:55.927
and choose the guy that ticks all the boxes.

62
00:06:56.526 --> 00:06:57.566
Here!

63
00:07:01.037 --> 00:07:03.336
- What a sinner you are, too. - What?

64
00:07:04.877 --> 00:07:06.807
What do you mean?

65
00:07:07.377 --> 00:07:08.847
I was reborn, you know.

66
00:07:09.006 --> 00:07:11.076
I no longer skip Do Ah's meals.

67
00:07:11.877 --> 00:07:13.146
Isn't that right, Do Ah?

68
00:07:34.597 --> 00:07:36.906
Don't you have gimbap in squared shapes?

69
00:07:42.776 --> 00:07:43.807
Want one?

70
00:07:59.357 --> 00:08:00.896
Ha Ri, why don't we go to lunch?

71
00:08:01.097 --> 00:08:02.927
What good would eating do?

72
00:08:03.396 --> 00:08:05.297
Why are you in a rotten mood?

73
00:08:05.696 --> 00:08:07.066
We need to shake these hangovers.

74
00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:08.506
Let's grab a bite to eat.

75
00:08:09.136 --> 00:08:10.766
Let's get something with a nice broth.

76
00:08:12.477 --> 00:08:13.636
Aren't you coming?

77
00:08:19.747 --> 00:08:22.617
I guess I need fuel.

78
00:08:25.456 --> 00:08:26.557
Gosh, that's good.

79
00:08:28.357 --> 00:08:30.727
Ms. Jang, will you be the next...

80
00:08:30.727 --> 00:08:32.557
editor-in-chief then?

81
00:08:34.326 --> 00:08:37.097
Editor-in-chief Jang, what are your thoughts?

82
00:08:38.836 --> 00:08:41.136
Will he sue me for this?

83
00:08:41.537 --> 00:08:43.566
What? Did you say something about your soup?

84
00:08:43.906 --> 00:08:46.807
A woman in her 30s who repeatedly...

85
00:08:46.807 --> 00:08:49.276
kissed and harassed a man she knew...

86
00:08:49.477 --> 00:08:52.146
was taken into police custody for questioning.

87
00:08:52.477 --> 00:08:54.047
The victim reported...

88
00:08:54.047 --> 00:08:56.716
that he's been suffering from a stress disorder.

89
00:08:56.987 --> 00:08:59.956
Ms. Yoon, it's not common for a woman to have been arrested...

90
00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:01.287
for sexual harassment.

91
00:09:01.386 --> 00:09:02.627
That's right.

92
00:09:02.627 --> 00:09:05.156
The woman justified her actions by saying...

93
00:09:05.156 --> 00:09:07.997
how men are never offended by advances made by women.

94
00:09:08.097 --> 00:09:10.997
I was surprised by her misguided notions.

95
00:09:16.337 --> 00:09:17.536
What a sinner.

96
00:09:18.207 --> 00:09:20.276
You're right about that.

97
00:09:20.737 --> 00:09:21.947
What a nutjob.

98
00:09:22.146 --> 00:09:24.447
- Hi, it's been a while. - Hello.

99
00:09:24.447 --> 00:09:25.646
- Hi! - Hi, guys.

100
00:09:25.646 --> 00:09:27.776
- All the tables are full. - We'll wait.

101
00:09:30.516 --> 00:09:32.357
I'm done with my meal.

102
00:09:32.556 --> 00:09:34.686
- You can sit here. - You barely touched it.

103
00:09:34.686 --> 00:09:35.756
I said I'm done.

104
00:09:36.227 --> 00:09:37.987
Ha Ri, who'll pay for this?

105
00:09:38.727 --> 00:09:39.926
But I didn't bring my purse.

106
00:09:40.296 --> 00:09:41.457
My gosh.

107
00:09:41.457 --> 00:09:42.697
I didn't bring my purse either.

108
00:09:42.697 --> 00:09:44.926
Gosh. I'd like to order!

109
00:09:47.867 --> 00:09:50.436
Goodness. Oh, dear.

110
00:09:53.107 --> 00:09:55.077
This can't be happening.

111
00:10:03.286 --> 00:10:04.347
Ms. Jang.

112
00:10:05.186 --> 00:10:06.786
I'm sorry about yesterday.

113
00:10:07.487 --> 00:10:08.857
Why did you do it?

114
00:10:11.487 --> 00:10:13.896
Because I heard you liked me.

115
00:10:14.127 --> 00:10:16.127
You were talking to Ms. Park and...

116
00:10:17.896 --> 00:10:21.197
So I gave you the wrong idea.

117
00:10:21.867 --> 00:10:22.906
I'm sorry.

118
00:10:24.607 --> 00:10:26.176
We were only talking about sperm donation.

119
00:10:28.207 --> 00:10:31.847
No, please don't apologize. It's my fault.

120
00:10:33.146 --> 00:10:35.987
It's all right. I don't have the right to judge you anyway.

121
00:10:36.217 --> 00:10:38.617
I'm no different which is why I should just die.

122
00:10:41.087 --> 00:10:42.426
Thank you, Ms. Jang!

123
00:10:43.227 --> 00:10:45.556
(Episode 8: Maybe a Misunderstanding,)

124
00:10:45.556 --> 00:10:49.296
(Maybe a Mix Up, Maybe Love?)

125
00:10:50.827 --> 00:10:52.837
Mr. Han, over here.

126
00:10:57.337 --> 00:10:59.607
- Mr. Yoon, over here! - Gosh.

127
00:10:59.607 --> 00:11:00.607
Hi.

128
00:11:01.107 --> 00:11:03.506
I see that Mr. Han is here too.

129
00:11:03.776 --> 00:11:06.146
Is this a special occasion?

130
00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:09.046
- We meet again. - Right.

131
00:11:15.227 --> 00:11:16.656
He's rated with two stars.

132
00:11:17.656 --> 00:11:18.796
He's rated with a triangle.

133
00:11:21.627 --> 00:11:23.627
Brothers...

134
00:11:25.796 --> 00:11:27.036
May I call you that?

135
00:11:27.036 --> 00:11:28.237
- No. - Don't.

136
00:11:30.136 --> 00:11:33.276
You said this was about Ha Ri, so go ahead.

137
00:11:33.676 --> 00:11:37.406
You see, I made a huge mistake with Ms. Jang.

138
00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:38.947
What kind of mistake?

139
00:11:41.646 --> 00:11:43.117
I made a confession in the wrong way.

140
00:11:46.587 --> 00:11:48.087
What confession did you make?

141
00:11:48.556 --> 00:11:50.926
You must've done something wrong.

142
00:11:50.926 --> 00:11:53.497
What is it? Did you borrow money you can't pay back?

143
00:11:55.296 --> 00:11:57.026
I think I have feelings for Ms. Jang.

144
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:04.480
I think I have feelings for Ms. Jang.

145
00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.630
Hey, young man.

146
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.559
What's with the "I think"?

147
00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.799
Saying I like her doesn't seem serious enough,

148
00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.130
but saying I look up to her sounds too serious.

149
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.870
I think it's in the middle.

150
00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.110
But why would you tell her that?

151
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.409
It's obvious she'll slap you silly.

152
00:12:28.709 --> 00:12:30.579
I already did get hit.

153
00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.850
But I want to do it properly. I was hoping to ask you two for advice.

154
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:37.919
We're something like allies, right?

155
00:12:38.049 --> 00:12:39.620
No, we're not.

156
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.890
Actually, go for it.

157
00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.630
Ha Ri likes the attention,

158
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.929
so plan a surprise for her in the heart of Myeongdong...

159
00:12:49.929 --> 00:12:52.100
- so that everyone can see. - A surprise?

160
00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.699
With a huge bouquet.

161
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.600
With a million flowers.

162
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.740
That's right. And...

163
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.110
you can't leave out singing and dancing.

164
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:01.909
Looking at you, I think...

165
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.839
- you should do some b-boying. - B-boying?

166
00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:09.049
But the 2020 trend is the Bongsan mask dance.

167
00:13:09.179 --> 00:13:10.579
It's big in Hongdae right now.

168
00:13:11.789 --> 00:13:12.890
You know your stuff.

169
00:13:13.049 --> 00:13:15.390
You should play an instrument too.

170
00:13:16.419 --> 00:13:18.020
- The gong? - Castanets?

171
00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.559
- Triangle? - The ajaeng.

172
00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:20.929
Those are good too.

173
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.000
If you can, I recommend the saxophone.

174
00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.530
That's great.

175
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.699
Brothers.

176
00:13:28.699 --> 00:13:30.799
I majored in applied music and the sax.

177
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.309
That's good. A saxophone serenade.

178
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.110
There will be videos all across social media.

179
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.250
She'll be so happy.

180
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.650
You're a real romantic.

181
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.020
My shoulder... It hurts.

182
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:49.260
What if he looks good doing it?

183
00:13:50.159 --> 00:13:51.659
I didn't think of that.

184
00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.059
Ha Ri does fall for strange things at times.

185
00:13:59.069 --> 00:14:00.870
- Eu Ddeum? - She'll like...

186
00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.140
But just unilaterally telling someone you like them...

187
00:14:03.439 --> 00:14:05.110
will make them feel awkward.

188
00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:07.039
Especially someone like Ha Ri.

189
00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:10.640
I know. I think...

190
00:14:10.939 --> 00:14:13.709
she's only interested in me because I have a lot of sperm.

191
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.520
- You have a lot of what? - You have a lot?

192
00:14:17.079 --> 00:14:19.390
Yes, like 10 times the norm.

193
00:14:22.159 --> 00:14:23.319
What...

194
00:14:24.059 --> 00:14:25.159
Does Ha Ri know that?

195
00:14:25.159 --> 00:14:28.530
Yes. I said I'd give it to her, but she seems to be pondering about it.

196
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.500
So you are...

197
00:14:32.199 --> 00:14:34.470
the legendary king of sperms?

198
00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.539
That's why he had two stars.

199
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:50.579
Ms. Jang.

200
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.350
I have a question.

201
00:14:52.689 --> 00:14:55.620
Which do you prefer between the Bongsan mask dance...

202
00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.760
and b-boying?

203
00:14:57.089 --> 00:14:58.530
Bongsan what?

204
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.760
I'm thinking of taking dance classes.

205
00:15:01.089 --> 00:15:02.100
Which do you prefer?

206
00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:06.130
Do what you like. I'm not a fan of either.

207
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:08.699
I see. You don't like either.

208
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.640
Why do I suddenly have goosebumps?

209
00:15:28.689 --> 00:15:29.959
Ms. Jang.

210
00:15:30.589 --> 00:15:33.130
Do you have a favorite song?

211
00:15:33.789 --> 00:15:36.730
- Excuse me? - I want to practice singing.

212
00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:37.860
What song do you like?

213
00:15:37.959 --> 00:15:40.100
You should pick a song that you like.

214
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.640
I don't... Well...

215
00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:51.179
What's this? I suddenly have the chills.

216
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:56.179
I'm so cold.

217
00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:00.250
Are you going home?

218
00:16:01.049 --> 00:16:04.620
If you had to choose between the alto sax and the soprano sax,

219
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:06.130
which would it be?

220
00:16:06.689 --> 00:16:07.730
Eu Ddeum.

221
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.400
If you're planning something because you feel bad for me, don't.

222
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:14.699
I can't see anything right now.

223
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.909
I'm sorry. I felt like I made a huge mistake, so...

224
00:16:25.679 --> 00:16:27.309
You should leave this place quickly.

225
00:16:28.679 --> 00:16:30.949
- Pardon? - Go inside. Quickly.

226
00:16:35.659 --> 00:16:37.260
Why does the back of my head suddenly sting?

227
00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.460
Mr. Nam.

228
00:16:41.289 --> 00:16:43.299
Isn't this Ms. Jang's?

229
00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:46.500
I think so. It's been there since yesterday. She must have left it.

230
00:16:46.569 --> 00:16:48.230
- Bring it to her. - Okay.

231
00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:07.089
She won't find it then.

232
00:17:17.399 --> 00:17:20.230
You've read Ms. Jang's column, right?

233
00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:23.139
How will she get pregnant?

234
00:17:23.139 --> 00:17:25.440
How would I know something you guys don't?

235
00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:27.010
I think she has someone.

236
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.139
Then we should help.

237
00:17:29.139 --> 00:17:32.480
Ha Ri is so clueless when it comes to seducing men.

238
00:17:32.649 --> 00:17:35.980
Mr. Nam. Don't try to coach others on relationships.

239
00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:38.990
I used to get a lot of attention from women back in the day.

240
00:17:39.149 --> 00:17:41.490
Here we go with "back in the day."

241
00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.289
You'll tell her to send a note...

242
00:17:43.289 --> 00:17:45.230
to meet in front of the fountain.

243
00:17:46.089 --> 00:17:47.160
I'm speechless.

244
00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.559
Do you think I'm a college student from the 70s?

245
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.160
If you like someone, you should say so.

246
00:17:51.559 --> 00:17:53.329
You should be straightforward.

247
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.339
No, no.

248
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.069
When you seduce someone, you don't make the move.

249
00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.569
You make the other person make the move.

250
00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.639
How?

251
00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:07.549
Oh my gosh!

252
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.680
Seriously. You scared me.

253
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.280
- Gosh. - I'm sorry.

254
00:18:12.349 --> 00:18:14.190
I've never watched others eat before.

255
00:18:18.889 --> 00:18:20.389
Dong Ah, you slide down.

256
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.500
Bo Ram, and Soo Ah, you too.

257
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.460
Look at the photographer and smile, okay?

258
00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.000
- Okay. - Good.

259
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.210
He said he'd be mean and cut me off.

260
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:35.309
But he doesn't have to glare at me as if he's going to kill me.

261
00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.879
Subtly show the other person through your actions...

262
00:18:40.349 --> 00:18:42.579
that you are interested in them.

263
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:44.680
Just enough to get their attention.

264
00:18:45.349 --> 00:18:47.720
If you're too obvious about it,

265
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:49.359
it'll be counterproductive.

266
00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.799
Okay, so... For the next cut,

267
00:18:59.799 --> 00:19:02.899
she'll hang upside down. I want a playful expression.

268
00:19:02.899 --> 00:19:05.440
Why don't you look at me when you talk? It bothers me.

269
00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.470
Well, I feel awkward looking at you.

270
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.980
Are you trying to act pretty?

271
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.020
Why would I do that?

272
00:19:22.819 --> 00:19:24.289
Putting my hair behind my ear?

273
00:19:24.889 --> 00:19:26.559
You did that.

274
00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:28.260
What...

275
00:19:28.629 --> 00:19:29.760
How is this acting pretty?

276
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.069
I just put my hair back because it was in my face.

277
00:19:32.069 --> 00:19:34.869
Look. How is this acting pretty? I was putting my hair back.

278
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:38.399
Why are you putting the moves on me...

279
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.010
so blatantly?

280
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.369
Don't do this.

281
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.809
What... Don't do what?

282
00:19:46.809 --> 00:19:48.079
Was he traumatized?

283
00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:50.819
I can't even touch my hair.

284
00:20:13.109 --> 00:20:14.470
He must've felt unpleasant when I made the moves.

285
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:15.710
No wonder it didn't work.

286
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:20.549
It must have been very traumatizing.

287
00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.730
He won't even let me look.

288
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.809
That was so spicy.

289
00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:54.879
My tongue's burning.

290
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.859
She likes spicy foods.

291
00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.289
Why is she...

292
00:21:06.059 --> 00:21:08.629
When you talk, you need to whisper.

293
00:21:09.329 --> 00:21:10.829
If you whisper,

294
00:21:10.829 --> 00:21:13.670
the other person will naturally lean over to listen.

295
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:17.299
Then your face will become closer to theirs.

296
00:21:17.639 --> 00:21:21.470
And that will make that person's heart flutter.

297
00:21:23.339 --> 00:21:25.410
Gosh, why did I eat that?

298
00:21:27.349 --> 00:21:31.349
Why are you whispering? Talk louder so I can hear you.

299
00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:34.389
The chili pepper was too spicy.

300
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:41.559
Hey, why are you breathing like that?

301
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:48.000
Why... Why are you sucking on the candy?

302
00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:49.970
Must you suck it like that?

303
00:21:50.569 --> 00:21:53.069
Do you want one as well? I should've offered you one.

304
00:21:53.069 --> 00:21:54.309
I'm sorry.

305
00:21:55.069 --> 00:21:56.309
Here you go.

306
00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.410
- Here's a candy. - No, it's okay. Stop.

307
00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:02.319
Ms. Jang, if you keep doing that, things will get dangerous.

308
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.079
What...

309
00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:10.119

I'm too healthy.

I personally think you're too ethical.

314
00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:40.089
You know it won't do you any good if you keep holding it in.

315
00:22:40.319 --> 00:22:41.819
Don't hold it in too much.

316

But I told you.

- but I think I'm still a candidate. - What?

320
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:57.200
A triangle. I won't even ask for a star.

321
00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:58.940
A triangle.

322
00:22:59.869 --> 00:23:03.109
A triangle. That's all I ask for.

323
00:23:04.139 --> 00:23:05.210

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.609
- Hey, wait. - Yes?

363
00:26:03.119 --> 00:26:04.220
I remember now.

364
00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:08.960
Remember what?

365
00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:13.099
That day, when we first met...

366
00:26:19.665 --> 00:26:21.925
That day, when we first met...

367
00:26:26.135 --> 00:26:27.905
I remembered what I did that day.

368
00:26:29.034 --> 00:26:31.774
I finally get why you said you felt unpleasant.

369
00:26:38.375 --> 00:26:39.385
Right.

370
00:26:42.445 --> 00:26:43.514
That's it?

371
00:26:44.215 --> 00:26:46.784
What more do I need to say?

372
00:26:48.284 --> 00:26:49.925
It's all in the past.

373
00:26:51.425 --> 00:26:53.125
But you told me it felt unpleasant.

374
00:26:53.925 --> 00:26:57.764
I mean, you could even sue me for that.

375
00:27:01.905 --> 00:27:04.334
It wasn't that unpleasant for me...

376
00:27:04.705 --> 00:27:06.205
to sue you.

377
00:27:10.274 --> 00:27:14.185
Back then, I was very sensitive.

378
00:27:16.254 --> 00:27:17.254
Yes.

379
00:27:18.215 --> 00:27:20.784
But it did...

380
00:27:22.084 --> 00:27:24.594
console me.

381
00:27:28.994 --> 00:27:32.865
Then why are you being so complicated?

382
00:27:36.774 --> 00:27:39.975
Back then, it was just a light feeling.

383
00:27:39.975 --> 00:27:43.145
But that's not the case for both of us...

384
00:27:43.544 --> 00:27:44.645
this time.

385
00:27:46.685 --> 00:27:47.915
Although, it didn't last long.

386
00:27:58.524 --> 00:27:59.594
Ms. Jang.

387
00:28:02.524 --> 00:28:03.564
Did you really...

388
00:28:06.034 --> 00:28:08.665
think of me as a man?

389
00:28:14.105 --> 00:28:15.105
What?

390
00:28:36.165 --> 00:28:38.094
Well, he's obviously a man.

391
00:28:44.675 --> 00:28:47.445
Hey, it's time to go to work.

392
00:28:50.044 --> 00:28:52.244
Gosh, what's his problem?

393
00:29:00.455 --> 00:29:02.625
Do Ah, you like beef soup, don't you?

394
00:29:02.794 --> 00:29:05.725
You'll get that for lunch today, so I hope you enjoy it.

395
00:29:06.665 --> 00:29:07.764
There she is.

396
00:29:09.665 --> 00:29:12.234
Hey, what kind of a normal guy in Korea...

397
00:29:12.234 --> 00:29:14.234
would willingly donate their sperm to you?

398
00:29:14.465 --> 00:29:15.734
Whoever offers it to you has got to be weird.

399
00:29:16.175 --> 00:29:17.675
This is what Einstein said.

400
00:29:18.074 --> 00:29:21.205
"Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age 18."

401
00:29:21.504 --> 00:29:23.774
Don't speak as if what you think is common sense.

402
00:29:24.215 --> 00:29:26.185
Some would've donated it for a good cause,

403
00:29:26.185 --> 00:29:27.445
so don't speak ill of them.

404
00:29:27.744 --> 00:29:29.244
I get what kind of situation you are in...

405
00:29:29.244 --> 00:29:30.655
and how you must feel right now.

406
00:29:31.155 --> 00:29:33.754
But do you really think this is realistically possible?

407
00:29:34.084 --> 00:29:35.125
And of all people...

408
00:29:36.425 --> 00:29:37.695
Why are you nagging at me...

409
00:29:37.695 --> 00:29:39.155
even when I've offered to take Do Ah to the daycare center?

410
00:29:39.155 --> 00:29:41.024
- What's your standard? - Standard for what?

411
00:29:41.425 --> 00:29:43.465
What's your standard when choosing the right sperm?

412
00:29:45.094 --> 00:29:47.504
It needs to be powerful enough to get me pregnant in one go.

413
00:29:48.465 --> 00:29:50.574
How will you ever know that?

414
00:29:50.574 --> 00:29:52.435
Do you have see-through vision? How are you going to tell?

415
00:29:52.435 --> 00:29:55.475
I'm looking for a young, healthy guy who doesn't drink or smoke.

416
00:29:55.705 --> 00:29:57.115
Is that Eu Ddeum?

417
00:29:58.314 --> 00:30:00.744
- What? - Have you made up your mind?

418
00:30:02.814 --> 00:30:04.955
By any chance, am I...

419
00:30:06.455 --> 00:30:07.484
one of the candidates?

420
00:30:08.855 --> 00:30:10.094
Would you donate yours to me?

421
00:30:12.294 --> 00:30:13.324
What?

422
00:30:17.764 --> 00:30:19.165
I'm quite conservative, you know.

423
00:30:21.865 --> 00:30:23.304
Why would I give you mine...

424
00:30:24.675 --> 00:30:26.205
when I could just marry you?

425
00:30:27.175 --> 00:30:29.004
You're super annoying, you know that?

426
00:30:29.044 --> 00:30:30.774
Let's just go, sister.

427
00:30:31.215 --> 00:30:33.014
- You're the worst. - Seriously?

428
00:30:33.014 --> 00:30:36.145
Why does she keep calling me that? Does she think I'm her sister?

429
00:30:37.054 --> 00:30:38.155
Just you wait and see.

430
00:30:38.685 --> 00:30:41.084
"Honey, sweetheart."

431
00:30:41.185 --> 00:30:42.855
"My love."

432
00:30:43.554 --> 00:30:44.725
That's what you'll soon call me.

433
00:30:45.054 --> 00:30:46.695
"Artificial insemination"?

434
00:30:47.264 --> 00:30:49.834
It's not impossible per se, but the odds can't be guaranteed.

435
00:30:50.534 --> 00:30:53.135
Why would she think of that instead of getting married?

436
00:30:54.965 --> 00:30:57.635
It must be easier for her to find sperm instead of a husband.

437
00:30:57.905 --> 00:31:00.004
- As if it's that easier. - Tell me about it.

438
00:31:00.475 --> 00:31:03.774
She thinks sperm donation is the same as donating blood.

439
00:31:05.044 --> 00:31:07.844
Is she queer...

440
00:31:08.014 --> 00:31:09.584
or is she just sick of men?

441
00:31:11.784 --> 00:31:13.584
- Well... - I think I can tell.

442
00:31:14.225 --> 00:31:15.355
Is she well-off?

443
00:31:15.725 --> 00:31:18.455
- Well... - Then her chances are slim.

444
00:31:20.695 --> 00:31:23.294
She could easily provide for a man on her own.

445
00:31:23.294 --> 00:31:26.564
Also, she's incredibly beautiful and lovely.

446
00:31:27.734 --> 00:31:28.865
Then what's her issue?

447
00:31:30.504 --> 00:31:32.074
She doesn't have any.

448
00:31:33.105 --> 00:31:35.244
For her, finding a sperm donor might be better...

449
00:31:35.774 --> 00:31:37.145
than marrying some random guy.

450
00:31:37.875 --> 00:31:39.074
Then what's the problem?

451
00:31:39.645 --> 00:31:42.814
I'm torn to think of her marrying someone else.

452
00:31:43.385 --> 00:31:45.484
But having another man's child?

453
00:31:45.855 --> 00:31:48.955
It seems like something that can't be undone.

454
00:31:50.254 --> 00:31:53.465
Why would you want to undo it? Do you want to date her yourself?

455
00:31:54.225 --> 00:31:56.334
Then date her right now.

456
00:31:56.794 --> 00:32:00.465
Is she too pretty to date or marry a single father who's divorced?

457
00:32:00.534 --> 00:32:03.405
What's wrong with being divorced when I also have a sweet daughter?

458
00:32:04.334 --> 00:32:05.635
She might think otherwise.

459
00:32:06.574 --> 00:32:07.645
Right, well...

460
00:32:08.375 --> 00:32:09.445
I'll see you around.

461
00:32:09.814 --> 00:32:10.844
Sure.

462
00:32:20.125 --> 00:32:21.254
Have you eaten?

463
00:32:21.824 --> 00:32:24.395
I haven't. Care to join me?

464
00:32:24.494 --> 00:32:26.764
Don't talk to me like nothing happened.

465
00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:28.925
It makes me hate you even more.

466
00:32:30.594 --> 00:32:33.834
Can we at least get together for Do Ah's first birthday photo?

467
00:32:33.834 --> 00:32:35.304
She only gets to take it once.

468
00:32:35.865 --> 00:32:38.274
- I should be in it. - Don't think about using her.

469
00:32:38.675 --> 00:32:39.705
I won't ever agree to it.

470
00:32:42.375 --> 00:32:44.114
Are you thinking about marrying Ha Ri?

471
00:32:46.545 --> 00:32:47.614
It's been on my mind.

472
00:32:50.585 --> 00:32:51.855
Ha Ri...

473
00:32:52.554 --> 00:32:55.424
will be furious when she finds out that you're only using her...

474
00:32:55.924 --> 00:32:57.125
to get back at me.

475
00:33:02.025 --> 00:33:04.134
Promise to meet up for a meal sometime.

476
00:33:11.835 --> 00:33:12.975
Yes, Ms. Choi.

477
00:33:13.074 --> 00:33:16.074
Eu Ddeum, I asked you to send the products.

478
00:33:16.074 --> 00:33:17.315
They're not here!

479
00:33:20.284 --> 00:33:22.214
The model is on her way, so what now?

480
00:33:25.985 --> 00:33:29.625
Yes, of course. I'll call you back.

481
00:33:31.225 --> 00:33:32.525
What did they say?

482
00:33:33.494 --> 00:33:35.994
That I didn't mention it. I thought I had though.

483
00:33:36.835 --> 00:33:38.264
Are you kidding me?

484
00:33:38.264 --> 00:33:40.835
The baby model is already on her way from Gyeongju!

485
00:33:40.835 --> 00:33:42.835
I also have a photoshoot in Chuncheon...

486
00:33:42.835 --> 00:33:44.605
so I need to hurry and go after this.

487
00:33:44.674 --> 00:33:47.775
They agreed to call a nearby store,

488
00:33:48.145 --> 00:33:50.775
so I'll bring over the products. Excuse me.

489
00:33:51.844 --> 00:33:54.014
You don't even have a car. I'm coming with you!

490
00:33:55.985 --> 00:33:58.214
Hurry up. Move!

491
00:33:59.784 --> 00:34:01.384
Yes, this is The Baby.

492
00:34:01.455 --> 00:34:03.094
Didn't the head office call?

493
00:34:03.755 --> 00:34:05.594
Yes, products that were on display sounds fine.

494
00:34:06.525 --> 00:34:08.565
Yes, I'll be right there.

495
00:34:12.094 --> 00:34:14.205
- Get in. - Sure.

496
00:34:20.744 --> 00:34:22.145
Hurry!

497
00:34:27.284 --> 00:34:29.045
- Sorry about this. - Your belt.

498
00:34:35.924 --> 00:34:37.625
If I have to book another model,

499
00:34:37.625 --> 00:34:40.025
I'm going to call you every night just to torture you.

500
00:34:40.395 --> 00:34:43.565
If I get an earful for rescheduling this photoshoot,

501
00:34:44.435 --> 00:34:47.065
I'll nag you every morning until your ears bleed.

502
00:34:48.165 --> 00:34:50.634
And, if Ha Ri scolds me for this,

503
00:34:50.634 --> 00:34:52.804
I'll make you go shopping with me every weekend.

504
00:34:53.804 --> 00:34:55.205
That I can do!

505
00:34:55.475 --> 00:34:57.214
- What? - You can call me anytime.

506
00:34:57.214 --> 00:34:58.545
I'll be your porter.

507
00:35:00.714 --> 00:35:02.844
I won't make you just come shopping with me.

508
00:35:04.815 --> 00:35:05.985
You'll also have to buy me lunch.

509
00:35:06.315 --> 00:35:08.784
Yes, I'll buy. Even dessert.

510
00:35:09.485 --> 00:35:11.094
It won't end there.

511
00:35:11.795 --> 00:35:13.324
You'll have to treat me to a movie, too.

512
00:35:13.324 --> 00:35:16.324
Sure thing. Tell me when there's a movie you want to see.

513
00:35:16.324 --> 00:35:17.395
I'll get the tickets.

514
00:35:20.304 --> 00:35:21.634
Good job!

515
00:35:22.235 --> 00:35:23.804
Once more.

516
00:35:24.435 --> 00:35:25.904
How pretty.

517
00:35:27.944 --> 00:35:29.705
Great, smile!

518

(Jambi Studio)

519
00:35:44.594 --> 00:35:45.594
I'm sorry.

520
00:35:46.824 --> 00:35:48.864
I'll only let it slide this once.

521
00:35:49.125 --> 00:35:51.594
You're still a newbie, so mistakes can be made.

522
00:35:52.235 --> 00:35:55.335
But your personal life shouldn't distract you like this.

523
00:35:56.205 --> 00:35:58.674
- Sorry? - Tell me what's on your mind.

524
00:36:00.975 --> 00:36:01.975
Well...

525
00:36:04.275 --> 00:36:05.275
It's nothing.

526
00:36:08.985 --> 00:36:11.255
I don't think it's right for me to tell you.

527
00:36:12.654 --> 00:36:14.085
It'll ruin my plan.

528
00:36:14.755 --> 00:36:17.924
How do you want to say it then?

529
00:36:18.094 --> 00:36:20.194
Instead of worrying about it alone,

530
00:36:20.194 --> 00:36:21.725
discuss your options with me.

531
00:36:22.065 --> 00:36:23.464
I'll pretend not to know anything.

532
00:36:28.364 --> 00:36:30.674
Well, you see...

533
00:36:35.505 --> 00:36:37.214
I'm trying...

534
00:36:38.045 --> 00:36:40.145
to confess my feelings to someone.

535
00:36:47.784 --> 00:36:49.025
No, I can't.

536
00:36:50.455 --> 00:36:51.494
I can't.

537
00:36:54.824 --> 00:36:55.964
- Eu Ddeum. - Yes?

538
00:36:56.735 --> 00:36:57.764
Follow me.

00:37:23.085 --> 00:37:24.125
(The Baby Jang Ha Ri)

542
00:37:31.395 --> 00:37:33.534
- Hello? - Are you at the studio?

543
00:37:34.165 --> 00:37:35.205
Yes.

544
00:37:35.534 --> 00:37:38.174
I think the infertile couple...

545
00:37:38.975 --> 00:37:40.674
managed to conceive.

546
00:37:41.404 --> 00:37:42.444
That's great news.

547
00:37:42.645 --> 00:37:43.775
Isn't it?

548
00:37:45.145 --> 00:37:47.344
Today's photoshoot will be them...

549
00:37:47.344 --> 00:37:49.014
confirming it at the hospital.

550
00:37:49.714 --> 00:37:52.085
They're worried about it being a false positive.

551
00:37:52.784 --> 00:37:55.554
It's why we must make them feel as comfortable as possible.

552
00:37:58.255 --> 00:37:59.855
Sure thing. I'll keep that in mind.

553
00:38:07.705 --> 00:38:08.864
How will you get there?

554
00:38:09.634 --> 00:38:12.275
It would be awkward to carpool, right?

555
00:38:15.505 --> 00:38:18.244
I'll meet you at the hospital. I have other errands, you see.

556
00:38:22.045 --> 00:38:24.755
Sure thing. I'll see you there.

557
00:38:25.514 --> 00:38:26.585
Got it.

558
00:38:50.674 --> 00:38:52.815
- Could I leave this with you? - Sure.

559
00:39:03.625 --> 00:39:06.324
Did you really think of me as a man?

560
00:39:20.344 --> 00:39:22.605
I heard that your blood test had good numbers.

561
00:39:23.045 --> 00:39:24.145
I'm sure it's a positive.

562
00:39:24.645 --> 00:39:27.915
We had three miscarriages...

563
00:39:28.284 --> 00:39:29.915
and the procedure failed before,

564
00:39:30.955 --> 00:39:33.315
so it feels like being optimistic might jinx it.

565
00:39:36.085 --> 00:39:37.424
I shouldn't even talk about it like this.

566
00:39:38.725 --> 00:39:40.694
There aren't any negative things you can say...

567
00:39:41.494 --> 00:39:43.435
that'll subdue your true desires.

568
00:39:45.935 --> 00:39:47.165
I'm sure it'll all work out.

569
00:40:03.114 --> 00:40:04.614
Do you see the womb?

570
00:40:06.485 --> 00:40:08.784
Congratulations. You really are pregnant.

571
00:40:10.625 --> 00:40:11.694
Honey.

572
00:40:12.025 --> 00:40:13.565
You did great.

573
00:40:24.074 --> 00:40:25.275
Thank you.

574
00:40:30.744 --> 00:40:31.975
- There we go. - Thank you.

575
00:40:32.975 --> 00:40:34.844
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

576
00:40:36.244 --> 00:40:37.815
I don't know yet.

577
00:40:38.054 --> 00:40:40.455
I don't think I can relax until we pass the first trimester.

578
00:40:40.955 --> 00:40:42.955
Let's just be happy today without thinking too much ahead.

579
00:40:44.125 --> 00:40:45.694
I'll congratulate you too.

580
00:40:50.264 --> 00:40:53.134
When did you prepare a gift?

581
00:41:02.304 --> 00:41:04.514
Honey, look. The baby really will be this tiny, right?

582
00:41:04.875 --> 00:41:06.444
I feel strange.

583
00:41:09.185 --> 00:41:10.985
I have something for you too.

584
00:41:15.185 --> 00:41:17.824
- This is a gift from me. - What is this?

585
00:41:20.895 --> 00:41:22.665
I know it wasn't easy for me,

586
00:41:23.025 --> 00:41:25.395
but I feel like it won't be easy for you either.

587
00:41:26.335 --> 00:41:28.505
I succeeded, so take my energy.

588
00:41:32.205 --> 00:41:34.605
Thank you. Yes...

589
00:41:41.585 --> 00:41:43.415
Is that tiny thing the baby?

590
00:41:44.654 --> 00:41:47.284
Yes. Isn't the baby handsome?

591
00:41:48.685 --> 00:41:50.125
He or she will be very attractive.

592
00:41:52.194 --> 00:41:53.395
You're right.

593
00:41:54.525 --> 00:41:57.165
Since the baby was conceived with such desperation,

594
00:41:58.935 --> 00:42:00.534
I bet it'll be pretty.

595
00:42:09.545 --> 00:42:11.744
I can't tell you who it is.

596
00:42:12.915 --> 00:42:13.944
Yes?

597
00:42:14.045 --> 00:42:15.985
I did tell her that I liked her,

598
00:42:16.614 --> 00:42:17.755
but I think I did it wrong.

599
00:42:18.614 --> 00:42:22.025
I asked for advice on it too, but I don't think that's it either.

600
00:42:23.455 --> 00:42:25.554
Have you never had a girlfriend before?

601
00:42:26.194 --> 00:42:28.525
No. I've had girls ask me out all the time.

602
00:42:29.025 --> 00:42:30.565
But this is my first time asking.

603
00:42:32.194 --> 00:42:34.335
You must have had many girlfriends.

604
00:42:34.565 --> 00:42:35.605
Yes.

605
00:42:35.964 --> 00:42:37.705
But none of them lasted very long.

606
00:42:37.904 --> 00:42:40.275
They all say they develop a temper once they go out with me.

607
00:42:40.505 --> 00:42:42.005
I don't understand why.

608
00:42:43.545 --> 00:42:44.975
I think I do.

609
00:42:45.475 --> 00:42:48.985
Anyway, you must like her a lot.

610
00:42:49.244 --> 00:42:51.185
So much that you want to ask her out for the first time.

611
00:42:53.784 --> 00:42:55.225
The truth is...

612
00:42:57.355 --> 00:42:58.494
I'm not sure.

613
00:42:59.225 --> 00:43:01.065
I did fall for her, but I'm not sure if it's love.

614
00:43:01.395 --> 00:43:04.134
I think we should go out first to figure it out.

615
00:43:05.534 --> 00:43:08.964
How irresponsible. That's not right.

616
00:43:10.605 --> 00:43:12.835
Is it wrong to ask someone out just because you want to go out?

617
00:43:13.235 --> 00:43:15.505
You need to go out and have feelings develop...

618
00:43:15.775 --> 00:43:17.275
for it to grow into love.

619
00:43:17.844 --> 00:43:20.844
Well, if that's how you feel,

620
00:43:20.844 --> 00:43:22.545
try asking her out.

621
00:43:22.685 --> 00:43:25.585
Do as I say, and she'll say yes. Write it down.

622
00:43:25.985 --> 00:43:27.085
Okay.

623
00:43:28.424 --> 00:43:31.255
- Okay. - A candlelit path.

624
00:43:31.594 --> 00:43:33.924
"A candlelit path."

625
00:43:33.994 --> 00:43:36.694
Make a heart with flowers and stand in the middle of it.

626
00:43:36.895 --> 00:43:38.864
"Make a heart with flowers..."

627
00:43:38.964 --> 00:43:40.194
Don't do stuff like that.

628
00:43:41.804 --> 00:43:45.605
What? Don't women like things like this?

629
00:43:45.605 --> 00:43:47.674
How are you going to turn off all of the candles?

630
00:43:50.614 --> 00:43:52.315
I'd get lightheaded.

631
00:43:52.315 --> 00:43:55.114
I especially hate doing it in public in front of a lot of people.

632
00:43:55.384 --> 00:43:57.014
I absolutely hate that.

633
00:43:57.085 --> 00:43:59.355
But I was told to do it in front of a lot of people.

634
00:44:00.625 --> 00:44:01.955
Those guys... Seriously.

635
00:44:02.685 --> 00:44:04.494
Then what should I do?

636
00:44:05.694 --> 00:44:06.855
You don't need any of that.

637
00:44:07.694 --> 00:44:09.025
A ring is all you need.

638
00:44:09.824 --> 00:44:11.835
Cartior.

639
00:44:13.264 --> 00:44:15.464
"Cartior"?

640
00:44:15.534 --> 00:44:16.964
The one and only love.

641
00:44:17.134 --> 00:44:19.074
Each ring has a serial number,

642
00:44:19.074 --> 00:44:21.174
so mine is the only one in the entire world.

643
00:44:21.674 --> 00:44:23.174
What's the use of words?

644
00:44:23.875 --> 00:44:26.415
The ring itself speaks, "You're the only one".

645
00:44:30.315 --> 00:44:32.815
- "Cartior"? - Cartior.

646
00:44:33.114 --> 00:44:34.625
The heart ring.

647
00:44:35.384 --> 00:44:38.125
(Cartior)

648
00:44:39.625 --> 00:44:41.065
2,500 dollars?

649
00:44:42.694 --> 00:44:44.735
A ring is meaningful.

650
00:44:44.835 --> 00:44:46.335
Women don't necessarily like it because it's high-end,

651
00:44:46.464 --> 00:44:49.205
but women want to be their man's one and only love.

652
00:44:49.505 --> 00:44:52.005
She wants you to promise that.

653
00:44:52.674 --> 00:44:53.744
Promise.

654
00:44:54.804 --> 00:44:55.975
That's a month's salary.

655
00:44:57.875 --> 00:45:01.085
I'm 250 percent sure she'll say yes to that.

656
00:45:05.784 --> 00:45:06.855
It would fit right there.

657
00:45:08.125 --> 00:45:09.554
Do I finally get a ring?

658
00:45:13.994 --> 00:45:17.165
- Okay. Here we are. - What is this?

659
00:45:17.165 --> 00:45:18.464
I just want her to have a comfortable life.

660
00:45:18.464 --> 00:45:19.994
What use is success?

661
00:45:20.364 --> 00:45:21.605
Having an exciting life is the best.

662
00:45:22.235 --> 00:45:24.875
But if I could have my pick, I'd say this.

663
00:45:25.074 --> 00:45:28.045
- I hope she picks this. - Why would you want that?

664
00:45:28.105 --> 00:45:30.975
- She's my daughter. - Never going hungry is the best.

665
00:45:31.114 --> 00:45:32.574
- You're no better. - What do you mean?

666
00:45:32.574 --> 00:45:34.384
- Health is the best. - Health. Yes.

667
00:45:34.384 --> 00:45:36.284
This one. This, Do Ah.

668
00:45:36.284 --> 00:45:38.415
- That's money. - Goodness.

669
00:45:41.125 --> 00:45:42.585
Where will you do the doljabi ceremony?

670
00:45:43.025 --> 00:45:44.395
At the photography studio.

671
00:45:46.194 --> 00:45:47.864
Did you order the first birthday rice cake?

672
00:45:48.194 --> 00:45:49.324
Do I need one?

673
00:45:49.964 --> 00:45:51.165
What will you dress her in?

674
00:45:52.634 --> 00:45:53.694
This is pretty.

675
00:45:54.804 --> 00:45:57.605
- He isn't prepared at all. - Goodness.

676
00:45:59.835 --> 00:46:00.904
Okay.

677
00:46:01.475 --> 00:46:02.844
This is pretty too.

678
00:46:03.244 --> 00:46:04.315
Isn't it pretty?

679
00:46:05.514 --> 00:46:07.415
The studio will lend me everything.

680
00:46:08.045 --> 00:46:09.384
What if there's nothing that looks good on her?

681
00:46:09.485 --> 00:46:11.255
Then I'll have her wear her own clothes.

682
00:46:11.585 --> 00:46:12.685
What, long johns?

683
00:46:13.955 --> 00:46:15.154
Is that bad?

684
00:46:15.154 --> 00:46:16.625
Seriously...

685
00:46:16.625 --> 00:46:19.625
Her first birthday pictures will stay with her forever.

686
00:46:19.625 --> 00:46:20.895
She should look pretty.

687
00:46:21.464 --> 00:46:23.264
Here. This looks good on her.

688
00:46:23.264 --> 00:46:24.335
How pretty.

689
00:46:27.505 --> 00:46:28.605
You ugly thing.

690
00:46:29.435 --> 00:46:31.574
- Are you insane? - You don't usually,

691
00:46:31.574 --> 00:46:32.775
but you look really ugly today.

692
00:46:32.775 --> 00:46:34.875
Are you trying to start a fight? Here? Come at me.

693
00:46:35.005 --> 00:46:37.444
Stop it. You look even uglier.

694
00:46:38.444 --> 00:46:39.444
Check out.

695
00:46:39.775 --> 00:46:42.815
You lunatic. Wait here. You little...

696
00:46:49.855 --> 00:46:52.094
- Give me that. - It's okay. It's not heavy.

697
00:46:52.554 --> 00:46:54.494
Why are you acting differently?

698
00:46:54.594 --> 00:46:55.795
Give it to me.

699
00:46:55.795 --> 00:46:57.395
It's okay. What's wrong with you?

700
00:46:58.665 --> 00:46:59.864
Just push the stroller.

701
00:47:01.235 --> 00:47:02.534
If you made a 50-dollar purchase,

702
00:47:02.534 --> 00:47:04.534
you get a 100-dollar restaurant voucher.

703
00:47:10.344 --> 00:47:12.815
Do winners get picked by a lottery or something?

704
00:47:13.145 --> 00:47:15.614
No. All we need is a receipt showing the purchase...

705
00:47:15.614 --> 00:47:18.114
and confirmation that you're a family.

706
00:47:18.315 --> 00:47:19.755
- Honey, do you have the receipt? - Yes.

707
00:47:19.855 --> 00:47:21.824
You have it, sweetie? Good.

708
00:47:21.985 --> 00:47:24.395
You don't need a copy of our family registry, do you?

709
00:47:24.994 --> 00:47:26.094
Put down your number,

710
00:47:26.194 --> 00:47:28.594
and take the voucher, and come back with a family of four.

711
00:47:28.594 --> 00:47:31.094
- You fill it out, sweetie. - Shall I?

712
00:47:31.194 --> 00:47:32.295
Okay, honey.

713
00:47:36.205 --> 00:47:37.205
Okay.

714
00:47:39.475 --> 00:47:40.844
They're not married.

715
00:47:46.475 --> 00:47:48.585
Are you seriously committing fraud just for free food?

716
00:47:53.855 --> 00:47:55.455
Okay. That's right.

717
00:48:01.824 --> 00:48:02.864
There.

718
00:48:02.864 --> 00:48:03.895
Do you want to try this?

719
00:48:07.464 --> 00:48:08.534
Give me Do Ah, and eat.

720
00:48:10.005 --> 00:48:12.375
Do Ah, come to Daddy.

721
00:48:12.605 --> 00:48:15.944
There, there. Gosh.

722
00:48:17.514 --> 00:48:20.244
Do Ah, I can't use my hands because of you.

723
00:48:23.384 --> 00:48:25.585
Yes, you can. You have two hands.

724
00:48:25.585 --> 00:48:28.924
I can't use my hands right now and I'm starving.

725
00:48:31.994 --> 00:48:33.154
Yummy.

726
00:48:37.125 --> 00:48:39.165
Don't try so hard, Mr. Han.

727
00:48:39.264 --> 00:48:40.764
I don't think you're it either.

728
00:48:41.505 --> 00:48:44.335
Unless you have something to defeat the king.

729
00:48:46.705 --> 00:48:47.775
What are you babbling about?

730
00:48:48.275 --> 00:48:49.375
He's buying us food.

731
00:48:49.475 --> 00:48:50.975
Mr. Han knows too.

732
00:48:51.145 --> 00:48:54.985
Eu Ddeum confessed to both of us that he's the king.

733
00:48:57.755 --> 00:48:59.384
He must know since he read your column.

734
00:48:59.915 --> 00:49:02.924
Furthermore, she's not interested in men.

735
00:49:03.284 --> 00:49:04.855
Her objective is something else.

736
00:49:07.464 --> 00:49:08.764
- I know. - Great.

737
00:49:09.694 --> 00:49:10.735
But...

738
00:49:13.165 --> 00:49:14.935
will things change if I'm not her first option?

739
00:49:30.784 --> 00:49:33.284
(Workshops Available)

740
00:49:33.685 --> 00:49:35.225
"Leather craft."

741
00:49:36.455 --> 00:49:37.725
I've never tried that.

742
00:49:41.764 --> 00:49:43.594
I've never tried that.

743
00:50:04.985 --> 00:50:06.114
Ha Ri.

744
00:50:06.554 --> 00:50:09.284
Can you tell me the baby model's mother's phone number?

745
00:50:09.554 --> 00:50:12.295
Oh, sure. Just a second.

746
00:50:13.594 --> 00:50:14.994
Let me see.

747
00:50:20.935 --> 00:50:23.165
So Yoon, did you say you saw my diary...

748
00:50:23.804 --> 00:50:25.534
at Jambi Studio?

749
00:50:25.735 --> 00:50:28.105
Yes, it was on the table in the far corner.

750
00:51:11.815 --> 00:51:14.125
You read my diary, didn't you?

751
00:51:18.955 --> 00:51:20.594
Why didn't you just get angry at me?

752
00:51:25.565 --> 00:51:27.764
You gave me five stars for my personality,

753
00:51:27.764 --> 00:51:29.105
so why would I get angry?

754
00:51:30.835 --> 00:51:32.034
You should've gotten angry at me...

755
00:51:34.375 --> 00:51:35.904
so I could apologize.

756
00:51:39.714 --> 00:51:41.415
I'm sorry for judging you like that.

757
00:51:42.185 --> 00:51:43.985
I know I shouldn't have graded you.

758
00:51:46.784 --> 00:51:48.884
But I had no expectations for men.

759
00:51:50.225 --> 00:51:52.525
But I didn't think of you as nothing but a tool.

760
00:51:54.364 --> 00:51:55.494
I just thought...

761
00:51:56.994 --> 00:51:58.264
the three of you might...

762
00:51:59.295 --> 00:52:00.764
understand and help me.

763
00:52:05.134 --> 00:52:07.105
Even if you apologize and make things better,

764
00:52:08.244 --> 00:52:09.844
there's nothing I can do to help.

765
00:52:11.844 --> 00:52:13.545
That's why I didn't get angry at you.

766
00:52:16.014 --> 00:52:17.045
I know.

767
00:52:20.114 --> 00:52:21.585
My point is,

768
00:52:23.154 --> 00:52:24.824
I couldn't answer your question because I didn't understand...

769
00:52:25.994 --> 00:52:28.665
what you meant when you asked me if I thought of you as a man.

770
00:52:29.194 --> 00:52:30.494
I was worried I might make a mistake again.

771
00:52:35.404 --> 00:52:36.964
There's no intention behind this.

772
00:52:39.375 --> 00:52:40.574
But now,

773
00:52:43.775 --> 00:52:45.074
I do have feelings for you.

774
00:52:57.125 --> 00:52:58.924
- Ms. Jang. - You can tell me...

775
00:53:00.025 --> 00:53:02.964
once you can solely focus on your feelings.

776
00:53:05.364 --> 00:53:07.065
Otherwise, you'll end up losing me.

777
00:54:01.485 --> 00:54:04.424
Can't you just give in?

778
00:54:04.855 --> 00:54:06.725
You know you have feelings for her.

779
00:54:07.355 --> 00:54:09.625
You should be honest about how you feel at times.

780
00:54:10.094 --> 00:54:11.795
You can't hide your emotions.

781
00:54:15.804 --> 00:54:18.475
I know I'm being a coward.

782
00:54:21.444 --> 00:54:22.775
But unfortunately,

783
00:54:24.674 --> 00:54:28.685
Ms. Jang and I are hopeless.

784
00:54:32.154 --> 00:54:33.455
I don't like kids.

785
00:54:35.485 --> 00:54:38.255
But she's trying so hard to have a baby.

786
00:54:42.594 --> 00:54:44.435
It's not about yielding to one another.

787
00:54:46.534 --> 00:54:47.534
We just...

788
00:54:49.464 --> 00:54:51.335
want different things in life.

789
00:54:53.074 --> 00:54:56.105
Life isn't a cab. It doesn't always go the way you want it to.

790
00:54:56.844 --> 00:54:59.744
I guess you've shut the doors to your heart after the last breakup.

791
00:54:59.744 --> 00:55:01.545
But it's all in the past now.

792
00:55:02.014 --> 00:55:03.585
Just do what your heart tells you.

793
00:55:04.415 --> 00:55:07.255
Just follow where it leads you to.

794
00:55:36.884 --> 00:55:38.654
I also want to follow my heart...

795
00:55:40.014 --> 00:55:41.924
and just hold your hand...

796
00:55:43.625 --> 00:55:47.625
like all the other couples do, Ms. Jang.

797
00:55:55.964 --> 00:55:59.804
I wanted to get swayed and get closer to you...

798
00:56:01.645 --> 00:56:03.145
as if it were a mistake.

799
00:56:11.955 --> 00:56:15.355
I also wanted to hold your hand.

800
00:56:25.494 --> 00:56:27.864
I closed my heart because I didn't want to get hurt.

801
00:56:29.804 --> 00:56:32.775
It's us grown-ups who really need compliments.

802
00:56:36.574 --> 00:56:38.244
Good job, Mr. Han.

803
00:56:42.585 --> 00:56:46.784
(Good job!)

804
00:56:57.295 --> 00:56:58.295
Don't cry.

805
00:56:58.994 --> 00:57:00.634
My heart ached...

806
00:57:02.005 --> 00:57:03.935
when I saw you cry...

807
00:57:05.875 --> 00:57:07.235
like a little child.

808
00:57:15.985 --> 00:57:18.154
And to be honest, when we first met,

809
00:57:20.384 --> 00:57:22.424
I was determined not to fall in love again,

810
00:57:25.755 --> 00:57:27.554
but you totally made me forget about that.

811
00:58:28.185 --> 00:58:29.654
Just like you,

812
00:58:30.755 --> 00:58:32.455
I also want to be happy.

813
00:58:33.795 --> 00:58:35.424
And just like you,

814
00:58:36.065 --> 00:58:37.725
I want to be honest about how I feel.

815
00:59:00.614 --> 00:59:02.384
But I've been through enough to know...

816
00:59:05.025 --> 00:59:06.694
that it's not just me who ends up getting hurt.

817
00:59:10.295 --> 00:59:11.694
The other person gets hurt as well.

818
00:59:20.435 --> 00:59:22.074
You may have entered my heart...

819
00:59:23.304 --> 00:59:25.174
and stirred me up like this.

820
00:59:28.114 --> 00:59:29.614
But all I need to do is just ignore it.

821
00:59:56.005 --> 00:59:57.105
I just need to make sure...

822
00:59:58.815 --> 01:00:00.275
my heart doesn't flutter again.

823
01:00:47.295 --> 01:00:48.824
Why do we keep running into each other?

824
01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:52.594
Why do you keep...

825
01:00:54.835 --> 01:00:56.335
showing up like this?

826
01:01:00.134 --> 01:01:01.275
It truly is a coincidence.

827
01:01:03.174 --> 01:01:04.275
Good night, then.

828
01:01:29.634 --> 01:01:30.735
How can...

829
01:01:33.705 --> 01:01:35.904
you be this beautiful?

830
01:01:40.475 --> 01:01:41.844
And what if I'm beautiful?

831
01:01:47.884 --> 01:01:48.985
What comes next?

832
01:03:32.324 --> 01:03:34.994
(Oh My Baby)

833
01:03:34.994 --> 01:03:37.464
Is your pregnancy project...

834
01:03:37.464 --> 01:03:39.034
finally over then?

835
01:03:39.034 --> 01:03:42.404
Don't you think it's too soon to mention that after day one?

836
01:03:43.034 --> 01:03:44.634
Ms. Jang, can I see your hand?

837
01:03:45.475 --> 01:03:47.605
- Ta-da! - What are you doing?

838
01:03:47.634 --> 01:03:50.375
I don't like that you're dating him!

839
01:03:50.574 --> 01:03:52.174
I waited 10 years for a love like this.

840
01:03:52.375 --> 01:03:55.344
Ha Ri won't see you again if she knows what you're up to.

841
01:03:55.614 --> 01:03:58.955
There's something I wanted to share with you.

842
01:03:59.255 --> 01:04:01.985
But I don't think I can give it to you.
