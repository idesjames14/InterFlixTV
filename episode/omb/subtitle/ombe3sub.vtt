00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:48.029
- My goodness. - Why do they have to be so cute?

2
00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:49.059
My gosh.

3
00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:52.200
I won't get bewitched by you guys.

4
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.459
Why are you talking to yourself?

5
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.040
I thought you did aerobics, but it looks like you're in a circus.

6
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.580
I need to dress in fancy colors to stand out. You know nothing.

7
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.809
What are you doing here?

8
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.080
Mom.

9
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.150
Let's go on a date.

10
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.879
What will you buy for me?

11
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.919
Just hurry up and get changed.

12
00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:16.589
Make sure you get changed, okay?

13
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:33.570
Is this it?

14
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.239
- Buy me more. - No, stop

15
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.640
We bought enough.

16
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.190
My goodness, come here.

17
00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:21.220
Ever since I was young, I thought there'd be a secret to my birth.

18
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.349
I guess I was right. A real mother wouldn't have done this.

19
00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.489
If I wasn't your real mom,

20
00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.289
I wouldn't have bought you something so expensive.

21
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.560
It looks so fancy and beautiful on you.

22
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.060
It suits you so well.

23
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.530
Whatever. You're just sorry.

24
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.470
Let's say I bought you that because I felt sorry.

25
00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.970
But what about you? Why did you buy me all these gifts?

26
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.340
Did you get yourself in trouble?

27
00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.940
Gosh, no. Why would I get myself in trouble?

28
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.240
Why don't you ever get yourself in trouble?

29
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.810
You're almost 40. You should be more adventurous.

30
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.050
You're too honest and kind.

31
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.819
My goodness.

32
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.490
Then I guess I should get myself in big trouble.

33
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.889
You'd better not change your mind.

34
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.490
Promise me.

35
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.300
Why do I need to promise? What's with you?

36
00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:08.569
I made up my mind.

37
00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.199
And I hope you cooperate.

38
00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.250
Hey. You guys.

39
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.220
Can you not fight today? I even baked cookies for you guys.

40
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.250
- You know how to bake cookies? - Sit down.

41
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.659
Did you bake it with dirt?

42
00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.930
You're such a picky eater unlike how you look.

43
00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.030
Let's order pig trotters.

44
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.639
Pig trotters, my foot.

45
00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.039
It's a special party. Let's order chicken.

46
00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:49.840
I haven't been out in three months.

47
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.840
I haven't had fun for six months.

48
00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.310
I've been craving pig trotters for a few months now.

49
00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.379
Every day, I tell myself that I'll eat pig trotters tonight.

50
00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.050
I promise myself that.

51
00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.020
But once I clean the house, clean after the kids,

52
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.789
cook dinner for my husband, and eat the leftover food,

53
00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.690
I suddenly lose my appetite.

54
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.030
That's why I still haven't had pig trotters.

55
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.729
And in three hours,

56
00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.400
I'll be back in a world where there are no pig trotters.

57
00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.199
- Order pig trotters. - Got it.

58
00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:21.069
Yes, order chicken.

59
00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.039
Why do you have to be friends with a guy like him?

60
00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.680
We were friends first. You came later.

61
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.849
Darn you. You're so annoying.

62
00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.020
What's with her? Is she bipolar?

63
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.620
Don't mess with her. She has twin boys.

64
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.060
My goodness.

65
00:04:43.859 --> 00:04:47.060
Look at you. Are you an alcoholic?

66
00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.270
I think so. He got divorced, you know

67
00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:51.670
I can hear you.

68
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.370
- Just order pig trotters. - Order chicken.

69
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.709
- Pig trotters! - Chicken!

70
00:04:55.709 --> 00:04:57.069
- Trotters. - Fried chicken.

71
00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.579
- Trotters. - Fried chicken.

72
00:04:58.579 --> 00:04:59.610
I...

73
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.480
Shut it, both of you.

74
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.379
Before I order one of the two,

75
00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:06.550
I have an announcement to make.

76
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.790
First, fill your glasses.

77
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.560
This party...

78
00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:22.500
is to celebrate the second chapter of my life.

79
00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:26.000
I, Jang Ha Ri, have decided not to get married.

80
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.910
Guys, why aren't you saying anything?

81
00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:39.079
Whether you announce it or not,

82
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.850
it's not really up to you.

83
00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:45.620
Take me for instance. I grew up never wanting to get married.

84
00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.160
All I agreed to was a cup of coffee, but look at where I am now.

85
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.230
What's there to announce?

86
00:05:52.329 --> 00:05:54.759
There was a slim chance of you getting married anyway.

87
00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:57.399
Is this because of that blind date?

88
00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:02.440
No, that didn't go any further because we weren't compatible.

89
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.670
- Unbelievable. - Do you have dementia?

90
00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:05.910
Have you forgotten...

91
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.209
that you were never the dating type?

92
00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:10.649
Don't you remember?

93
00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:16.019
Ms. Jang?

94
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.889
- Gosh, what brings you here? - I had business nearby.

95
00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:23.389
Anyway, I've been meaning to call you.

96
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.730
But that would've been a mistake since you have a boyfriend.

97
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:30.569
He's just a friend. The son of my mom's friend.

98
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.300
Is that so?

99
00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.639
Right, then are you free this weekend?

100
00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:38.579
I have tickets to a musical if you're up for it.

101
00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:40.040
I'll even buy dinner.

102
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.180
A deadline is coming up for me, so maybe you can take someone else.

103
00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:50.319
The tickets are until this month. Would you be available?

104
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.490
I don't want to make a promise I can't keep.

105
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.430
By the way, did you see the announcement I sent out?

106
00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:00.259
I'll have Mr. Kim look at it.

107
00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.629
He'll now be taking over.

108
00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:04.829
- I'll see you around. - You too.

109
00:07:07.569 --> 00:07:08.769
What the...

110
00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:13.910
He just asked you out on a date, you moron.

111
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.579
When will you ever learn?

112
00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:21.079
This is why I never wanted to set you up with anyone.

113
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.219
I was clueless back then.

114
00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:29.990
No, your DNA has been wired this way.

115
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.829
You're right.

116
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.160
I've never been good at dating...

117
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.329
and marriage is a long-shot for me.

118
00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:36.600
So what?

119
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.600
There are more things we can't do compared to the ones we can.

120
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.440
Then why have you been desperate to get married?

121
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.670
Gosh.

122
00:07:42.769 --> 00:07:45.009
You know what? Good for you.

123
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.079
Marriage only leads to a dishtowel or a rag in your hand.

124
00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:50.579
Just like you have been so far,

125
00:07:50.579 --> 00:07:51.779
live your life with a laptop in one hand...

126
00:07:51.779 --> 00:07:54.350
and a take-out coffee in another.

127
00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.319
Right. Well, thanks for your sincere support.

128
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:07.560
Anyway, there's something else I wanted to tell you.

129
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.969
Hold on. But I've received so many monetary gifts from you.

130
00:08:12.269 --> 00:08:15.339
You know what? I'll buy you something for this occasion.

131
00:08:15.639 --> 00:08:17.240
Tell me whatever you need.

132
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.839
That's not necessary. Save it for yourself.

133
00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:22.610
- It's not even important. - Just take it.

134
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.879
This is probably your last chance to receive any celebratory gift.

135
00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:27.579
Zip it...

136
00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:29.589
or you'll taste my foot in your mouth.

137
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.719
Anyway, I...

138
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.829
So did you order the trotters?

139
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:39.259
Fried chicken comes first.

140
00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:40.959
Order the trotters right away.

141
00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:43.769
- No, fried chicken. - Trotters.

142
00:08:43.769 --> 00:08:44.969
Fried chicken!

143
00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:48.000
- You two... - No to trotters!

144
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.310
- You two! - Fine, I'll order it myself.

145
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:53.180
- Trotters are what I love. - Unbelievable.

146
00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.509
- I have no one looking out for me. - You jerk.

153
00:09:54.199 --> 00:09:55.410
You can't receive infertility treatments...

154
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.540
unless you're married.

155
00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.440
The only exceptions are for women in a de facto marriage.

156
00:09:59.609 --> 00:10:02.680
You need a spouse's consent to receive sperm from a donor.

157
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.819
So what's the best way to get pregnant within six months?

158
00:10:09.249 --> 00:10:13.790
You can marry a man and get pregnant with him...

159
00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.829
or...

160
00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:23.469
find some random guy and get knocked up.

161
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:30.270
What happens if I have the baby without his knowledge...

162
00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.239
and he finds out that I lied about it?

163
00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:36.650
Well...

164
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.020
It's like the storyline of my favorite soap opera.

165
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:49.859
Anyway, an unmarried woman can't find a sperm donor in Korea.

166
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.229
There aren't many donors for even all the infertile couples.

167
00:10:53.229 --> 00:10:56.630
I'm also a patient who was diagnosed as infertile.

168
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.699
The law is against it, so you must find another way.

169
00:10:58.969 --> 00:11:01.300
- I must find another way? - That's right.

170
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:03.209
On your own.

(Han Se Sang)

172
00:11:29.569 --> 00:11:32.670
- It's me. - Why haven't you been picking up?

173
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.069
- How was the move? - Fine.

174
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.910
It's the anniversary of dad's death next Wednesday.

175
00:11:40.609 --> 00:11:41.739
I know.

176
00:11:42.609 --> 00:11:43.680
You'll be there, right?

177
00:11:45.479 --> 00:11:46.579
Sure.

178
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:49.520
Be there. Mom's hoping to see you.

179
00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.199
Ms. Jang.

180
00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.680
Are you still embarrassed to see me?

181
00:12:21.479 --> 00:12:23.619
No, I couldn't be more comfortable around you.

182
00:12:23.619 --> 00:12:25.690
Is that so? Me too.

183
00:12:34.329 --> 00:12:36.199
What? What now?

184
00:12:40.339 --> 00:12:42.670
Thank you for working with us on the cover.

185
00:12:46.239 --> 00:12:48.310
Let me thank you for the car ride with a meal.

186
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.920
Just tell me what it is you want.

187
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.249
It's not like we're close enough to communicate through gazes.

188
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.589
I got it. I take back what I said about avoiding you.

189
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.989
- Bingo. - Gosh, I'm smart.

190
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:05.329
Like I said...

191
00:13:12.199 --> 00:13:13.369
Was I tricked just now?

192
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:18.040
Unbelievable.

193
00:13:25.079 --> 00:13:26.219
Sorry, everyone.

194
00:13:28.219 --> 00:13:30.150
- Be more punctual. - Sure thing.

(Special Interview with Won Bin and Lee Na Young)

197
00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:39.530
How exactly do they raise their son?

198
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.530
- I'll meet them and ask. - How do you expect to do that?

199
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:44.430
I'll try and schedule an interview.

200
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.400
Go ahead. Who knows?

201
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.940
We might have our first sold-out issue thanks to you.

202
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:50.339
Yes, boss.

206
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.979
Next.

207
00:14:01.819 --> 00:14:03.619
Where are we on the search for a columnist?

208
00:14:04.249 --> 00:14:06.859
What about that friend who's living off you and your mom?

209
00:14:06.859 --> 00:14:08.859
He's a single dad with a decent enough profile.

210
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.859
- Yoon Jae Young? - Yes.

211
00:14:15.369 --> 00:14:16.670
But he's clueless.

212
00:14:17.469 --> 00:14:19.300
Well, Sung Woo will be here.

213
00:14:19.569 --> 00:14:20.670
Sung Woo too?

214
00:14:21.569 --> 00:14:25.069
Do Ah, would you like some baby food?

215
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:29.479
Or how about this since you're older now?

216
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:31.410
I'm sure you're old enough for this.

217
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.219
He's a fun character.

218
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.719
It's better to feature a mess than an expert in childrearing.

219
00:14:37.719 --> 00:14:38.790
Try to get him on board.

220
00:14:39.359 --> 00:14:41.859
Since I'm back, we should grab some dinner.

221
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:43.459
Ask when the Advertising Department...

222
00:14:43.459 --> 00:14:44.859
and the people at the studio will be free.

223
00:14:45.229 --> 00:14:46.729
Can we go to my favorite restaurant?

224
00:14:46.729 --> 00:14:47.800
I'll book it myself.

225
00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.770
How about we get some raw fish?

226
00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:53.599
- No, Korean beef barbecue. - What?

227
00:14:53.599 --> 00:14:55.140
They're clueless, aren't they?

228
00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.709
- Sushi. - We should eat beef.

229
00:14:57.709 --> 00:14:59.910
- But it's a company dinner. - Come now. We should get sushi.

231
00:15:03.079 --> 00:15:04.680
Here's your food.

232
00:15:04.849 --> 00:15:06.550
Do Ah, do you want to eat this?

233
00:15:07.819 --> 00:15:08.819
Or this?

00:15:08.849 --> 00:15:10.589
Trust Daddy, okay?

235
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:13.020
Brand name foods are the best.

You pooped, didn't you?

Wipes.

239
00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:41.380
Let's go in. Hold on.

240
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.989
Why isn't there a changing table in the men's room?

241
00:15:52.499 --> 00:15:55.099
There it is. Hold on. Good girl.

242
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:56.670
Good.

243
00:15:56.729 --> 00:15:57.869
We're here.

244
00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.410

It's okay.

We're home. It's okay.

00:16:32.300 --> 00:16:33.900
Daddy's sorry. Hold on.

249
00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.010
Sorry. Daddy's sorry.

250
00:16:46.119 --> 00:16:47.280
You must be embarrassed.

251
00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.650
Daddy's sorry. I'll change your diaper quickly.

252
00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.729
Mister. Are you raising a baby on the street?

253
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:59.030
- What? - What did the baby do wrong?

254
00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.300
Don't use the stroller for garbage.

255
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.869
Put the baby in it.

256
00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.569
That's not mine. It's his.

257
00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.869
Is it your friend's?

258
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.310
He isn't my friend.

259
00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:10.739
He must be from a different district.

260
00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:17.280
Look.

261
00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.180
How do I look homeless to you?

262
00:17:23.249 --> 00:17:24.849
Isn't it obvious at a glance?

263
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.719
Of course. Just look at him. Everything screams "I'm homeless."

264
00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:31.459
I guess I am homeless.

265
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.099
Do Ah, I bought this earlier.

266
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:39.100
It's a bit small.

267
00:17:40.039 --> 00:17:42.769
My baby. Did that scare you?

268
00:17:42.769 --> 00:17:44.670
Look at it. Look.

269
00:17:47.009 --> 00:17:48.809
How many years has it been?

270
00:17:49.709 --> 00:17:53.219
I've wondered how you were doing after you left like that.

271
00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.449
That's what I thought. That's why I came to see you.

272
00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.489
Since it was a trip nonetheless.

273
00:17:59.019 --> 00:18:02.660
I'm glad you were relaxed enough to shop for a gift.

274
00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.830
Are you working again?

275
00:18:05.559 --> 00:18:06.600
Yes.

276
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.930
You must make the effort to get along with people.

277
00:18:10.029 --> 00:18:12.400
Being in large groups gives you confidence.

278
00:18:15.709 --> 00:18:16.870
Confidence.

279
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.039
What about corn-fidence?

280
00:18:21.739 --> 00:18:22.749
Wait for me.

281
00:18:26.719 --> 00:18:28.219
That must hurt.

282
00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.590
They're new, that's why.

283
00:18:29.719 --> 00:18:31.120
Can't you give up on heels?

284
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.719
The heels are an extension of the legs.

285
00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.890
True. I wore heels all the time in my 20s.

286
00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.400
They'll kill your knees. Comfort is the best.

287
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.039
Did I just sound super old?

288
00:18:47.199 --> 00:18:48.440
I'm glad you know.

289
00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:51.209
- I need to stop by a pharmacy. - Okay.

290
00:18:51.209 --> 00:18:52.309
Auntie!

291
00:18:55.009 --> 00:18:56.009
Bye.

292
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.019
"Baby" or "Children"?

293
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.320
Aren't they the same thing?

294
00:19:05.959 --> 00:19:07.019
I don't like it.

295
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:09.989
Will there be many staff members?

296
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:11.930
I don't like having too many people.

297
00:19:12.729 --> 00:19:14.959
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

298
00:19:24.809 --> 00:19:25.809
Are you okay?

299
00:19:28.009 --> 00:19:29.009
I'm fine.

300
00:19:29.009 --> 00:19:30.910
- Let me see. Is it... - No.

301
00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:31.910
- Is it bad? - No.

302
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.600
Are you okay?

303
00:19:49.699 --> 00:19:50.799
Wait right here.

304
00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:01.209
Leave it. I'll do it.

305
00:20:01.209 --> 00:20:02.509
It's not heavy.

306
00:20:02.509 --> 00:20:05.049
Exactly. So let me do it.

307
00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.979
You won't die if a man helps you, will you?

308
00:20:07.979 --> 00:20:10.320
It's my job. It really isn't heavy.

309
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.090
Let go. I'll do it. I'll put it there.

310
00:20:15.989 --> 00:20:18.690
Should I suspect?

311
00:20:19.999 --> 00:20:21.459
Should I get the wrong idea?

312
00:20:21.699 --> 00:20:24.330
Is it weird if I'm nice?

313
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:26.340
Very. Extremely.

314
00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.410
Come to think of it,

315
00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.340
I ran into you unexpectedly many times.

316
00:20:34.479 --> 00:20:36.279
Talk about luck.

317
00:20:36.309 --> 00:20:37.410
You mean bad luck.

318
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:39.620
Bad luck?

319
00:20:40.449 --> 00:20:43.190
Don't hate me so much.

320
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.160
It's harder to hate someone than it is to like someone.

321
00:20:50.059 --> 00:20:51.090
What does that mean?

322
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:55.900
Well...

323
00:20:57.699 --> 00:21:01.499
You have a bruise on your forehead.

324
00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:13.880
What is this?

325
00:21:23.489 --> 00:21:25.029
I almost got the wrong idea.

326
00:21:25.729 --> 00:21:26.729
Darn it.

327
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.430
I said to wait there.

328
00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:40.640
What is that?

329
00:21:41.209 --> 00:21:42.709
Your heel must hurt a lot.

330
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.350
Why do you care about my heel? This is awkward.

331
00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:55.320
Right? I may put it on wrong.

332
00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.029
I'll just take these.

333
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.100
Just be a colleague.

334
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:06.370
Okay.

335
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:14.610
He just doesn't get it.

336
00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:17.150
What a bother.

337
00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.920
Chunhang confirmed the order 2,000 of strawberry-flavored toothpaste.

338
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:27.719
Kiwi confirmed 1,000 orders of cotton-soft...

339
00:22:27.719 --> 00:22:28.920
baby wipes.

340
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:30.559
Hold on.

341
00:22:32.059 --> 00:22:33.160
Just toothpaste.

342
00:22:33.759 --> 00:22:34.830
Yes.

343
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.640
Can you brush your teeth with just toothpaste?

344
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.769
- No, sir. - Then what you do need?

345
00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.209
I need toothpaste.

346
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.509
If you know that...

347
00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.009
I'll give you another chance.

348
00:22:50.209 --> 00:22:52.680
Try to tack on toothbrushes too.

349
00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:54.279
Yes, sir.

350
00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:57.420
What did I tell you?

351
00:22:57.789 --> 00:22:59.820
Sales are all about networking.

352
00:22:59.959 --> 00:23:01.959
Visit a customer twice instead of once.

353
00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.959
You need to check every little thing...

354
00:23:04.959 --> 00:23:06.430
in fine detail.

355
00:23:07.059 --> 00:23:09.430
- Don't forget. - No, sir, I won't.

356
00:23:11.699 --> 00:23:15.370
Just earlier, Ms. Choi Hyo Joo had a cut on her right heel,

357
00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:18.410
so I ran over and bought her a band aid.

358
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:23.209
Why you...

359
00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.249
I teach you 1 thing, and you learn 10.

360
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:32.860
Good job.

361
00:23:33.559 --> 00:23:36.559
Customers are important too, but your reputation at work...

362
00:23:36.989 --> 00:23:39.299
shouldn't be ignored. Particularly...

363
00:23:40.299 --> 00:23:41.930
the editors.

364
00:23:42.059 --> 00:23:43.930
I told you, they're comrades as well as enemies.

365
00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:48.900
You need to make sure they are on your side.

366
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.610
Yes, sir.

367
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.529
What is this? What does she wear?

368
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:31.680
What are you doing at home? Is today a special day?

369
00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:35.380
No. Do Ah's poop got on my clothes.

370
00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.049
What a good daughter. She made her dad shower.

371
00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:39.459
Is she sleeping?

372
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:41.019
Yes.

373
00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.289
I don't see your laundry.

374
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.360
We should do our own laundry.

375
00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.229
We shouldn't make someone else do it for us.

376
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:55.239
Anyway, I need to start working again.

377
00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:57.739
But I'm worried because Do Ah is so young.

378
00:24:58.209 --> 00:25:01.440
I can't just leave her at a daycare center all day.

379
00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:05.209
My goodness, my back.

380
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.380
I think I have a herniated disk.

381
00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.219
Child abuse is a big issue these days.

382
00:25:11.519 --> 00:25:13.459
So I can't seem to trust anyone.

383
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:16.289
It'd be great if I could leave her with someone I know.

384
00:25:18.289 --> 00:25:20.729
Why does my wrist hurt so much?

385
00:25:21.259 --> 00:25:22.900
I think I have carpal terminal syndrome.

386
00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:25.170
Are you going on a trip?

387
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.070
It's carpal tunnel syndrome.

388
00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.840
Oh, right. Yes, that's what it is.

389
00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:35.309
You're right. You shouldn't overwork yourself at your age.

390
00:25:35.709 --> 00:25:37.910
Raising a baby isn't an easy job.

391
00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.620
I feel like it's become harder to raise kids than before.

392
00:25:43.949 --> 00:25:46.090
I don't do much, but it's still very tiring.

393
00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:51.259
I used to carry Ha Ri on my back when I used to run my own business.

394
00:25:51.759 --> 00:25:54.699
It was tiring, but Ha Ri was adorable back then.

395
00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:57.600
She was gentle, and she always smiled.

396
00:25:59.370 --> 00:26:02.070
Kids grow up so quickly, but that memory lasts a lifetime.

397
00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:07.080
I can babysit Do Ah from time to time,

398
00:26:07.209 --> 00:26:09.479
but you can't expect me to take care of her all the time.

399
00:26:09.479 --> 00:26:11.479
No one will care for your child better than yourself.

400
00:26:12.449 --> 00:26:16.449
The time you spend with her now will stay with you forever.

401
00:26:38.769 --> 00:26:41.340
(From: The Best Donor, Why don't we meet up and talk?)

402
00:27:13.539 --> 00:27:15.979
Anyway, an unmarried woman...

403
00:27:15.979 --> 00:27:18.549
can't find a sperm donor in Korea.

404
00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:29.320
Welcome.

405
00:27:51.709 --> 00:27:52.920
Excuse me.

406
00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:56.519
Are you The Best Donor?

407
00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.719
Yes, hello. I'm The Best Donor.

408
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:02.930
Take a seat.

409
00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:05.851
I'm 180cm tall.

410
00:28:07.581 --> 00:28:09.891
My IQ is 148. My blood type is O.

411
00:28:11.291 --> 00:28:12.450
I was in the special forces.

412
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.990
I'm a student at Hanguk University.

413
00:28:16.990 --> 00:28:19.760
I can assure you that I have the best-quality sperm.

414
00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:22.930
The best quality. Right.

415
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.430
I'll take that. Thanks.

416
00:28:25.601 --> 00:28:26.670
Gosh, that's hot.

417
00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.041
Well...

418
00:28:31.371 --> 00:28:32.510
The thing is,

419
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.581
I haven't decided to receive your sperm yet.

420
00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:40.450
But I'd like to know how this all works.

421
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.151
It's like a preliminary investigation.

422
00:28:42.351 --> 00:28:45.791
I'm a journalist, so I feel the urge to investigate.

423
00:28:45.791 --> 00:28:46.891
You're a journalist?

424
00:28:48.321 --> 00:28:51.331
No, I'm not a news journalist.

425
00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.861
I work at a magazine company.

426
00:28:52.861 --> 00:28:55.031
You know those magazines you see at hair salons?

427
00:28:55.631 --> 00:28:56.801
I won't publish an article.

428
00:28:58.270 --> 00:28:59.601
But still...

429
00:29:01.041 --> 00:29:03.240
I should know how it works...

430
00:29:03.371 --> 00:29:05.371
before I decide to take your sperm.

431
00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:08.940
Can you tell me how you plan to give me your sperm...

432
00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.450
and if it's safe?

433
00:29:12.081 --> 00:29:13.651
I'm sure it's not for free.

434
00:29:16.591 --> 00:29:19.621
I do this with a sense of duty...

435
00:29:20.121 --> 00:29:22.190
for those who desperately wish to have babies.

436
00:29:22.361 --> 00:29:25.131
Sperm donation is the same thing as organ donation.

437
00:29:25.331 --> 00:29:26.801
One saves lives,

438
00:29:26.801 --> 00:29:29.531
and the other creates lives. They're both equally important.

439
00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:32.470
So I only receive...

440
00:29:33.871 --> 00:29:35.500
10,000 dollars.

441
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.170
- 10,000 dollars? - Yes.

442
00:29:39.581 --> 00:29:42.781
I do it until you get pregnant. It's not enough, is it?

443
00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.950
Do you get requests from a lot of people?

444
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:48.121
As you can see, I have the best genes.

445
00:29:48.321 --> 00:29:50.851
So, women agree to take my sperm as soon as they see me.

446
00:29:52.351 --> 00:29:55.291
Then you must have a lot of unknown children.

447
00:30:05.331 --> 00:30:07.200
I can't do this job if I think of it that way.

448
00:30:08.371 --> 00:30:10.041
Yes, you're right.

449
00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:11.740
Exactly.

450
00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:15.781
And it's very important to give birth to a healthy baby.

451
00:30:16.351 --> 00:30:19.781
So instead of doing an IVF or artificial insemination,

452
00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.651
a lot of women prefer to get naturally pregnant.

453
00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:28.690
- "Naturally pregnant"? - Yes.

454
00:30:29.391 --> 00:30:30.861
I sleep with women every night...

455
00:30:32.031 --> 00:30:33.101
during their ovulation period.

456
00:30:34.361 --> 00:30:36.430
- "Every night"? - Yes, that's right.

457
00:30:36.831 --> 00:30:38.801
It's hard to get a woman pregnant in one try.

458
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:41.101
This is a very tiring job for me.

459
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.510
But I think of it as doing you guys a favor.

460
00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.740
If you're interested, let me know.

461
00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.281
And I noticed...

462
00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:56.420
that you're my type. I'll treat you nicely.

463
00:30:56.851 --> 00:30:57.950
Every night.

464
00:31:01.091 --> 00:31:03.230
You darn punk. Have you gone crazy?

465
00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:05.160
What is in your darn head?

466
00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.861
Stay right there. I'm going to call the cops.

467
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.601
Has this middle-aged lady lost her mind?

468
00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:13.270
What did you just call me?

469
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:15.700
You told me you have good eyesight. That was a lie, wasn't it?

470
00:31:15.801 --> 00:31:17.311
You don't go to Hanguk University either, do you?

471
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:19.940
You should be ashamed of yourself.

472
00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:22.210
- I'll teach you a lesson. - You wanted my sperm.

473
00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:24.510
So why should I be ashamed of myself?

474
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:26.651
Be quiet. I'm calling the cops.

475
00:31:27.081 --> 00:31:29.220
- Give me that. - Hey! Hey!

476
00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.351
Hey!

477
00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.720
That's you, right? We're the police.

478
00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.460
Someone reported you for illegal sperm donation and forgery.

479
00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.930
You impersonated a Hanguk University student, right?

480
00:31:39.591 --> 00:31:41.200
- Let's go to the police station. - No.

481
00:31:41.801 --> 00:31:43.331
I'm glad you're here.

482
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.571
I was just about to call you guys.

483
00:31:45.571 --> 00:31:48.101
Hurry up and take him. This guy is a bad seed.

484
00:31:48.101 --> 00:31:49.500
You need to come with us as well.

485
00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:52.170
Me? Why?

486
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.510
You got caught trying to make a deal.

487
00:31:54.811 --> 00:31:55.980
I didn't buy anything.

488
00:31:56.311 --> 00:31:59.180
I'm serious. I didn't even get to see his sperm.

489
00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:01.821
- Bye then. - Do you want to get handcuffed?

490
00:32:08.591 --> 00:32:09.831
Did you bring a car?

491
00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:11.561
Let's go.

492
00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:13.601
There he is.

493
00:32:14.031 --> 00:32:15.331
How do you feel right now?

494
00:32:15.331 --> 00:32:16.901
Get out of the way. Move.

495
00:32:16.901 --> 00:32:19.200
- Let's go. - Tell us how you feel.

496
00:32:19.301 --> 00:32:20.440
- How do you feel? - Tell us what you think.

497
00:32:20.541 --> 00:32:21.871
We're from the TV show...

498
00:32:21.871 --> 00:32:23.240
called "Unbelievable Incidents".

499
00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.970
- Can you tell us... - I have nothing to say.

500
00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:29.950
- Why were you with him? - I feel so wronged.

501
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:31.180
Tell us what happened.

502
00:32:31.281 --> 00:32:32.811
Excuse me.

503
00:32:32.811 --> 00:32:35.051
Tell us why you feel wronged.

504
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.950
Sir, I was really scared.

505
00:32:39.091 --> 00:32:42.220
I was scared that he might be in some kind of a crime syndicate.

506
00:32:43.291 --> 00:32:48.101
I went there to do my job as a journalist.

507
00:32:49.131 --> 00:32:51.131
Look at my hands. They're shaking.

508
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:55.041
I'm not brave enough to break the law.

509
00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:02.081
You must have a high arrest rate.

510
00:33:02.281 --> 00:33:04.281
Live a normal life.

511
00:33:04.281 --> 00:33:06.010
What's a normal life?

512
00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:08.680
Stick to the law and live like everyone else.

513
00:33:08.781 --> 00:33:10.391
Of course, I should stick to the law.

514
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:14.520
But sometimes, the law can't guarantee an individual's happiness.

515
00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.690
Ms. Jang, if you keep talking back, the investigation will last longer.

516
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:22.131
I didn't exactly talk back.

517
00:33:42.151 --> 00:33:43.221
Hey.

518
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.120
(Hanguk University College of Medicine, Yoon Jae Young)

519
00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.420
I'm Yoon Jae Young. I'm here to guarantee her identity.

520
00:33:48.821 --> 00:33:50.690
- Are you a lawyer? - No, I'm a doctor.

521
00:33:51.031 --> 00:33:52.190
I'm a pediatrician.

522
00:33:57.931 --> 00:33:59.870
Did you say something to her?

523
00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.940
(Hanguk University Hospital, Yoon Jae Young)

524
00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:07.511
You really are a pediatrician at Hanguk University Hospital.

525
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:12.781
You're the one...

526
00:34:12.781 --> 00:34:14.250
who contacted the scumbag...

527
00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:15.850
from the online community for infertile patients.

528
00:34:15.951 --> 00:34:18.321
Be honest and tell me why you contacted him.

529
00:34:18.551 --> 00:34:19.690
Like I said...

530
00:34:22.591 --> 00:34:24.361
I proved that I'm a doctor,

531
00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:26.960
but I have no proof that you're a cop.

532
00:34:28.301 --> 00:34:31.571
She was at the exchange site which is only circumstantial evidence.

533
00:34:32.071 --> 00:34:34.801
But instead of getting a witness statement from her,

534
00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:37.071
you're questioning her as if she's the perp.

535
00:34:38.071 --> 00:34:40.381
Did you give him any money?

536
00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.781
I'd rather help the unfortunate if I had any to spare.

537
00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.651
See?

538
00:34:44.951 --> 00:34:48.151
She's a curious woman with a tendency to take action,

539
00:34:48.151 --> 00:34:50.151
not one who'd be involved in an illicit crime.

540
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:54.020
Didn't you receive numerous prizes for good conduct as a kid?

541
00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:55.420
Yes, I led the volunteer club.

542
00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:58.890
Con artists are basically good people too.

543
00:34:59.091 --> 00:35:01.401
You may have to investigate to know about her,

544
00:35:01.761 --> 00:35:04.370
but I already know her all too well.

545
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.901
It's why I vouch for her.

546
00:35:12.911 --> 00:35:15.411
Are you sure you were working undercover?

547
00:35:17.111 --> 00:35:18.151
Yes.

548
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:19.781
All right.

549
00:35:20.221 --> 00:35:22.321
There was no money transaction, and I vouched for her.

550
00:35:22.321 --> 00:35:23.321
May we go now?

551
00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.790
Her identity has been vouched for,

552
00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.631
so you may go.

553
00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:33.261
Come on. Let's go.

554
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:35.100
Sure thing.

555
00:35:37.801 --> 00:35:40.100
Look at you with your head held up high.

556
00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.971
Well, I did nothing wrong.

557
00:35:41.971 --> 00:35:43.940
You're a brazen one, aren't you?

558
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:47.140
You're not good at a lot of things, but lying is at the top of the list.

559
00:35:47.241 --> 00:35:49.411
What do you mean you are an undercover journalist?

560
00:35:49.411 --> 00:35:51.381
What were you going to do with that sperm-selling jerk?

561
00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.181
I'm going to have a baby.

562
00:35:57.991 --> 00:36:00.460
What? With a 24-year-old?

563
00:36:01.761 --> 00:36:03.790
Say that you love him, and I'll kill you.

564
00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:04.991
It's not like that.

565
00:36:05.431 --> 00:36:07.361
He offered up his sperm.

566
00:36:08.361 --> 00:36:10.770
But for 10,000 dollars. Sounds like a scam, right?

567
00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:13.600
You were going to buy his sperm?

568
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.241
Do Ah's asleep, so keep it down.

569
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:21.681
This is a new kind of crazy, even for you.

570
00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:25.350
Did not being able to get married drive you to insanity?

571
00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.350
I want to have a baby without getting married.

572
00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:33.420
Forget it.

573
00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.520
It's not like you'd understand,

574
00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.031
and I don't expect you to.

575
00:36:38.761 --> 00:36:40.931
You've gone crazy.

576
00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:44.100
I know that it comes with all sorts of ethical problems.

577
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.471
But isn't it weird...

578
00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:50.310
that only a pregnancy by a married couple is deemed ethical?

579
00:36:51.241 --> 00:36:54.080
Sperm can't be donated to unmarried women.

580
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.781
So you thought of a way to get it done yourself?

581
00:36:57.850 --> 00:37:00.181
Well, I did my research.

582
00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.451
I don't know what to do with you.

583
00:37:07.221 --> 00:37:09.790
It's not my intention to break the law to get pregnant.

584
00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:12.330
I know I shouldn't have even thought about it,

585
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.730
and I'm sorry.

586
00:37:16.801 --> 00:37:19.000
Aren't you sorry for wanting a baby alone?

587
00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:22.640
I understand why you don't want to get married...

588
00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:24.241
and that you adore kids.

589
00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.611
But can't you...

590
00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.381
just get married and have children and live an ordinary life?

591
00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.980
I'm doing this to have an ordinary life.

592
00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:34.750
I'm 39.

593
00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.491
I still hope to meet...

594
00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.221
the man of my dreams as soon as I step outside those doors.

595
00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:44.290
But my reality is, I'm being called an old lady.

596
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:49.531
I don't know what qualifies as normal or ordinary,

597
00:37:50.631 --> 00:37:52.170
but I don't want to give up on my dreams...

598
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.701
because people can frown upon me.

599
00:37:55.301 --> 00:37:58.341
Should I be complacent and live with what life throws at me?

600
00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:02.111
39 is way too young for that.

601
00:38:17.591 --> 00:38:18.631
Unbelievable.

602
00:38:18.631 --> 00:38:21.531
How can you bring Do Ah out without a blanket?

603
00:38:21.531 --> 00:38:22.600
She's probably cold.

604
00:38:22.801 --> 00:38:24.170
Here you go.

605
00:38:24.471 --> 00:38:27.401
Hold the jacket. You've got to be kidding me.

606
00:39:07.341 --> 00:39:10.480
I want his. His is bigger.

607
00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:11.951
They're the same.

608
00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:15.221
No, his is bigger.

609
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.420
I want what he has.

610
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:20.821
Take it then.

611
00:39:22.091 --> 00:39:23.120
Wait. Guys, no.

612
00:39:23.531 --> 00:39:24.631
- Hold on. - Don't fight.

613
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.460
- Look at this. - Are you kidding me?

614
00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:30.531
Come on, let's go.

615
00:39:39.611 --> 00:39:41.681
Goodness me.

616
00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:45.381
Here you go. Please don't cry.

617
00:39:46.551 --> 00:39:48.980
You're okay. Enough with the tears.

618
00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.051
Who can watch the baby?

619
00:39:52.051 --> 00:39:54.221
Can someone take the baby?

620
00:39:54.221 --> 00:39:56.721
- Here. - I don't even hold my own nephew.

621
00:39:58.091 --> 00:39:59.991
- The baby... - My arm's killing me.

622
00:39:59.991 --> 00:40:01.261
Out of the blue?

623
00:40:01.761 --> 00:40:04.330
Can't anyone look after the baby?

624
00:40:05.531 --> 00:40:07.241
- Oh, no. - I'm here.

625
00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:15.940
Ms. Jang, the baby's crying.

626
00:40:19.781 --> 00:40:21.551
What are you so scared about?

627
00:40:21.551 --> 00:40:24.491
If the baby's crying,

628
00:40:24.491 --> 00:40:26.620
all you have to do is rock it gently.

629
00:40:26.620 --> 00:40:29.690
Was it that upsetting? I hear you.

630
00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:32.991
Who did this to you? Goodness.

631
00:40:33.131 --> 00:40:34.201
There you go.

632
00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:19.611
It's like she came to the rescue.

633
00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:33.551
- Guys. - Over here!

634
00:41:33.551 --> 00:41:35.591
- There you go. - How sweet.

635
00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:38.230
- Just a little bit more. - Good.

636
00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.031
Can you face each other? Delicious, isn't it?

637
00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:42.201
Turn only your heads this way.

638
00:41:42.201 --> 00:41:44.000
Yes, just the heads.

639
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.301
Good job. Could you face this way?

640
00:41:47.341 --> 00:41:49.600
You too, sweetie. There we go.

641
00:41:49.741 --> 00:41:51.511
There we go. Nice!

642
00:41:51.611 --> 00:41:53.270
Offer it to each other.

643
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:56.040
Can you look this way?

644
00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:57.080
Over here.

645
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.411
Ha Woon, let's have you turn around.

646
00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:01.451
Now look at the camera guy.

647
00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:05.321
Here you go.

648
00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.221
What?

649
00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:15.931
- I'll buy the beer. - No.

650
00:42:17.031 --> 00:42:18.730
- Am I buying the meal too? - No.

651
00:42:24.471 --> 00:42:26.440
Thank you for helping with the photo shoot.

652
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:27.881
Bingo.

653
00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:33.350
Why do you hate kids?

654
00:42:34.221 --> 00:42:36.420
Not everyone has to like kids.

655
00:42:36.451 --> 00:42:40.020
I just want to know if there's a particular reason.

656
00:42:40.051 --> 00:42:41.221
There isn't.

657
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:43.830
What if you need help with the kids like you did today?

658
00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.390
It's not like I can come to the rescue every time.

659
00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:50.161
How about you get some practice while working with us?

660
00:42:50.531 --> 00:42:51.571
Does practice make perfect?

661
00:42:51.571 --> 00:42:52.901
Yes, of course.

662
00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.670
Find something to adore, and you'll adore that person.

663
00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:58.841
Trying to like someone will make it real.

664
00:42:58.841 --> 00:43:01.040
You hating kids might be the key factor.

665
00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.511
- Do you want me? - Will my answer change your mind?

666
00:43:04.511 --> 00:43:06.551
- No. - I knew it.

667
00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:12.290
Can I ask you a personal question?

668
00:43:12.651 --> 00:43:14.460
Do I want to stay single because I hate kids?

669
00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.531
- How did you know I'd ask that? - You were building up to it.

670
00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:19.830
I see you get asked this a lot.

671
00:43:19.931 --> 00:43:21.131
Let's say that I do.

672
00:43:22.201 --> 00:43:24.170
What if you meet someone you love?

673
00:43:25.131 --> 00:43:27.031
And what if there's an unexpected pregnancy?

674
00:43:27.841 --> 00:43:29.040
That won't happen.

675
00:43:30.301 --> 00:43:32.810
I may not seem that way,

676
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.480
but the wall I have up are fairly thick.

677
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.810
So you've never once wanted to be a dad?

678
00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:42.580
No. Never. Not even once.

679
00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:50.321
Let me see.

680
00:43:53.661 --> 00:43:55.100
Where are all my clothes?

681
00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.440
Here it is.

682
00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.341
When did Mom last do the laundry?

683
00:44:04.741 --> 00:44:05.870
Seriously.

684
00:44:11.011 --> 00:44:12.151
What is this?

685
00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.091
What is all this?

686
00:44:21.261 --> 00:44:22.661
That little...

687
00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:25.690
Jae Young, you're dead.

688
00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:30.830
- Are you leaving? - No.

689
00:44:45.111 --> 00:44:47.781
I get to use my self-defense skills.

690
00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:53.120
Hey. Why are you beating him up first thing in the morning?

691
00:44:55.161 --> 00:44:57.190
I need to teach this punk a lesson.

692
00:44:57.361 --> 00:44:59.131
You cuckoo punk.

693
00:44:59.361 --> 00:45:01.661
How dare you put your dirty laundry in my hamper?

694
00:45:01.801 --> 00:45:03.201
I know you go through my stuff.

695
00:45:03.201 --> 00:45:04.301
What did you steal?

696
00:45:05.801 --> 00:45:08.370
I thought you'd do at least that much for me.

697
00:45:08.701 --> 00:45:12.710
I helped you out with your undercover project.

698
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:18.881
Do you think that was easy?

699
00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:20.920
Hey.

700
00:45:21.281 --> 00:45:24.890
How dare you throw that tiny, disgusting trotter?

701
00:45:25.451 --> 00:45:26.721
This is wrinkled.

702
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:30.161
You should've told me if you had laundry. I would've run it for you.

703
00:45:30.931 --> 00:45:33.960
You said you'd do your own laundry. Just put it in the hamper.

704
00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.000
- Come have breakfast. - Okay.

705
00:45:36.631 --> 00:45:38.901
Should I remove my laundry from the hamper?

706
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.670
Hey. Just leave it. It's fine!

707
00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:43.801
- Let go. - Brother.

708
00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:47.281
- I shall wash your laundry for you. - Fine. Let go.

709
00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:56.580
That annoying cuckoo punk.

710
00:46:03.721 --> 00:46:04.931
Auntie!

711
00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:08.661
Wait for me. Come on.

712
00:46:10.031 --> 00:46:12.031
- Isn't it so cold? - Sure.

713
00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.071
Auntie. Have you had breakfast? Auntie?

714
00:46:19.071 --> 00:46:20.881
Yes, I did.

715
00:46:22.241 --> 00:46:23.881
- Have a nice day. - Going up.

716
00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:26.310
Hello.

717
00:46:27.381 --> 00:46:30.321
Auntie. Lunch in the cafeteria today?

718
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.120
Sure.

719
00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:37.330
- Have a nice day. See you later. - Going up.

720
00:46:39.131 --> 00:46:41.060
That's right. Auntie. We have a company dinner tonight.

721
00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:42.131
You're going, right?

722
00:46:42.801 --> 00:46:43.861
I'm not sure.

723
00:46:43.861 --> 00:46:45.330
Okay. You're going.

724
00:46:47.741 --> 00:46:50.500
Have a nice day. What a great morning.

725
00:46:52.741 --> 00:46:55.381
That's right. Auntie, you...

726
00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:03.480
Eu Ddeum. There are no aunties at work.

727
00:47:05.951 --> 00:47:08.790
There are only bosses, bosses, and bosses. Understood?

728
00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:12.031
Okay.

729
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:20.230
Going up.

730
00:47:21.401 --> 00:47:22.500
What was that?

731
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:40.151
Look over there.

732
00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:44.131
(Why was she meeting a sperm donor con artist?)

733
00:47:50.631 --> 00:47:53.230
Auntie. I mean, she looks like you, Ms. Jang.

734
00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.911
I feel so wrongly accused.

735
00:47:57.911 --> 00:47:59.611
So tell us.

736
00:47:59.611 --> 00:48:01.310
Please tell us.

737
00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:02.381
No pictures.

738
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:07.210
Drink. Drink up. Let's drink.

739
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.181
This woman who claims she was just curious.

740
00:48:09.951 --> 00:48:11.091
She's single.

741
00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:14.261
Plus, she is a reporter at a magazine.

742
00:48:14.821 --> 00:48:17.361
She stated that she was doing an undercover investigation.

743
00:48:17.631 --> 00:48:20.230
However, our findings show...

744
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:23.201
that the magazine is not doing an undercover investigation.

745
00:48:23.201 --> 00:48:24.801
This is unfair.

746
00:48:24.801 --> 00:48:27.230
I only contacted him out of curiosity.

747
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:29.471
He said his sperm was superior...

748
00:48:29.471 --> 00:48:30.741
I didn't buy it!

749
00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:32.611
I didn't even get to see it.

750
00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:35.011
How could that be me?

751
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:38.210
How could that be me? That's absurd.

752
00:48:39.381 --> 00:48:42.151
Yes. The bruise on your forehead. It's the same.

753
00:48:42.151 --> 00:48:45.190
Why did this woman, who is a reporter,

754
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:48.491
- meet this man... - My stomach...

755
00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:52.091
- My stomach. - It's there.

756
00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:55.431
- My stomach. - We want to know.

757
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.661
Gosh.

758
00:49:16.551 --> 00:49:17.651
Mom.

759
00:49:18.951 --> 00:49:20.051
Come in.

760
00:49:36.670 --> 00:49:39.579
- Mom. - Why you...

761
00:49:39.579 --> 00:49:41.650
You tried to buy what illegally?

762
00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:44.880
Is life too boring? Do you want to go to jail?

763
00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.520
Auntie. You should hear her out before you hit her.

764
00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:50.090
She was undercover.

765
00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:52.960
You know how reporters go in secretly and investigate a story.

766
00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:54.360
She's amazing.

767
00:49:59.159 --> 00:50:01.270
Is that right? Is it?

768
00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:03.369
Yes.

769
00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:05.139
Your face says otherwise.

770
00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:07.369
Tell me the truth.

771
00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.110
Did you try to buy sperm?

772
00:50:09.369 --> 00:50:11.380
Why would you buy sperm?

773
00:50:14.409 --> 00:50:15.509
Mom.

774
00:50:19.679 --> 00:50:22.389
I'm thinking of getting a sperm donor and having a baby.

775
00:50:24.719 --> 00:50:27.759
I'm sorry for upsetting you, but I won't get married.

776
00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:31.500
It's not like getting married guarantees happiness.

777
00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.199
And... Mom, I...

778
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:38.540
You'll have a baby by yourself without getting married?

779
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:40.139
You want to be a single mom?

780
00:50:41.509 --> 00:50:43.210
- Mom... - Do you know how hard it is...

781
00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:45.610
to raise a child alone? Have you gone mad?

782
00:50:46.079 --> 00:50:49.380
I raised you alone, so my heart aches for single moms.

783
00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:53.279
But people don't try to understand why you're doing it alone.

784
00:50:53.279 --> 00:50:55.290
Even if they see a single mom walking by,

785
00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:57.860
they criticize her and say she's tough and has bad luck.

786
00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.860
It was bad enough I had to hear that. Why should you?

787
00:51:03.259 --> 00:51:04.730
Then should I...

788
00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:07.199
live alone for the rest of my life?

789
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:13.469
If I don't get married?

790
00:51:14.509 --> 00:51:15.710
If you're gone?

791
00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.810
Should I live just for myself?

792
00:51:19.739 --> 00:51:21.380
You say you live for me.

793
00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:25.980
Should I live alone without any family,

794
00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.290
living just for myself, and then die alone?

795
00:51:34.020 --> 00:51:35.989
I want to live for someone too.

796
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:44.099
You crazy witch.

797
00:51:44.869 --> 00:51:47.610
You saw how I lived.

798
00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:51.440
How could you even think about having a kid alone?

799
00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.840
You should think about being happily married!

800
00:51:55.509 --> 00:51:57.719
You raised me just fine without a husband.

801
00:51:58.179 --> 00:52:00.679
No. It was hard even when Dad was around.

802
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:04.420
I grew up watching you and Dad fight all the time.

803
00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.360
You only showed me that marriage makes you sad.

804
00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:08.889
Why are you telling me to do something you couldn't?

805
00:52:08.989 --> 00:52:10.460
Is it my fault you're not married?

806
00:52:10.759 --> 00:52:13.000
Did I tell you to learn from me?

807
00:52:13.259 --> 00:52:14.969
Why is it my fault that your life is messed up?

808
00:52:14.969 --> 00:52:16.500
Why is my life messed up?

809
00:52:18.270 --> 00:52:19.969
Is it messed up not to get married in case...

810
00:52:19.969 --> 00:52:21.670
- I end up like you? - Hey.

811
00:52:22.509 --> 00:52:23.670
That's enough.

812
00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:27.710
Auntie. Calm down. Let's talk about it tomorrow.

813
00:52:29.049 --> 00:52:30.150
Get out.

814
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:33.219
Don't learn from me and ruin your life.

815
00:52:33.579 --> 00:52:36.849
You're smart, so get out and live as you want.

816
00:52:36.849 --> 00:52:39.759
Get out. Get out.

817
00:52:40.119 --> 00:52:41.690
Get out right now! Get out.

818
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.730
Wait outside.

819
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:52.699
- Are you okay? - Yes.

820
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:27.560
Don't cry.

821
00:54:32.799 --> 00:54:34.299
What are you doing?

822
00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:40.279
You said this is what I should do when someone cries.

823
00:54:45.849 --> 00:54:46.849
I'm not a kid.

824
00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:51.020
You look like one right now.

825
00:55:12.909 --> 00:55:14.110
Thanks.

826
00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:23.619
Please don't ask me what happened.

827
00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:25.389
I wasn't going to.

828
00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:28.130
I figured it might be too embarrassing for you.

829
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:32.000
I'm so pathetic.

830
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:36.469
I'm about to turn 40, but I'm still so immature.

831
00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:38.570
You're good as long as...

832
00:55:38.869 --> 00:55:41.540
you didn't run outside after you got scolded by your mom.

833
00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:45.940
I'm 41.

834
00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:49.179
But I still don't know what it means to be an adult.

835
00:55:50.009 --> 00:55:53.079
My body keeps aging, but my heart is still young.

836
00:55:54.219 --> 00:55:56.119
When I see something nice, I want to have it.

837
00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.360
When someone offends me, I get angry.

838
00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:00.659
When I suffer a loss, I feel upset.

839
00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:03.759
I still feel everything I felt as a kid.

840
00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:05.900
So I don't get what's so different about being 40.

841
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:11.840
There's nothing good about aging.

842
00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:15.509
But if I have to choose, I guess the only good thing...

843
00:56:17.009 --> 00:56:18.710
is that I have a better judgment of character.

844
00:56:22.179 --> 00:56:24.980
Even if you were that weird lady on TV,

845
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:27.779
I know for a fact...

846
00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:35.290
that you're a good person.

847
00:56:38.299 --> 00:56:39.500
Ha Ri.

848
00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:55.579
What are you doing out here after fighting with your mom?

849
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:57.849
I didn't fight with my mom.

850
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:02.790
We meet again.

851
00:57:04.119 --> 00:57:06.489
You didn't have to come looking for me. I was going to go home.

852
00:57:06.489 --> 00:57:08.759
Why did you wear my slippers?

853
00:57:08.759 --> 00:57:10.630
They're expensive. They're my favorite.

854
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:11.730
Hurry up and wear your shoes.

855
00:57:17.029 --> 00:57:18.299
What are you doing?

856
00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:24.170
What? Hurry up so we can go home.

857
00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:27.949
Let's go.

858
00:57:29.409 --> 00:57:30.849
We live together.

859
00:57:32.049 --> 00:57:33.820
- What are you saying? - Let's go.

860
00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.520
Why are you so loud?

861
00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.989
- I'm not loud. - Be quiet!

862
00:57:37.989 --> 00:57:39.320
I'm the quietest person on earth.

863
00:57:57.170 --> 00:58:00.179
I can't believe you were talking to a guy after you ran out like that.

864
00:58:00.279 --> 00:58:02.449
Do you really have to say it like that?

865
00:58:02.449 --> 00:58:05.179
I've had enough for today. Let's just walk home quietly.

866
00:58:15.329 --> 00:58:16.960
I'm not being sarcastic.

867
00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.000
Don't care about what others say.

868
00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:24.099
I'm just saying you should do whatever you want...

869
00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:25.969
regardless of what others might think.

870
00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:29.210
What's with you? I'll see you.

871
00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:31.170
I quit working at the hospital.

872
00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:36.250
But you still have some time until your leave is over.

873
00:58:36.679 --> 00:58:37.849
I thought you wanted to become a professor.

874
00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.520
I won't have time to do lectures, treat patients,

875
00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.520
and write theses.

876
00:58:43.989 --> 00:58:47.259
I feel so upset that I can't get to do what I wanted.

877
00:58:48.690 --> 00:58:50.659
But what can I do? I'll just have to get by.

878
00:58:52.099 --> 00:58:53.699
How exactly?

879
00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.099
I'm going to open up a hospital...

880
00:58:55.099 --> 00:58:56.270
with the money I got from selling my apartment.

881
00:58:56.799 --> 00:58:58.540
That's why I moved into your place.

882
00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:03.310
I've been wasting away my life after I was left with Do Ah.

883
00:59:03.969 --> 00:59:05.880
But funnily enough, I found myself...

884
00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:07.779
gaining strength from her.

885
00:59:10.679 --> 00:59:12.719
I know it's hard for me to fully understand you.

886
00:59:13.619 --> 00:59:15.820
But if you need someone,

887
00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:18.389
and you want that to be a baby, I'd understand.

888
00:59:24.290 --> 00:59:25.460
I'm also a dad.

889
00:59:26.199 --> 00:59:29.130
And you're probably doing your best to get by just like me.

890
00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:34.000
I'll publish an interview about your hospital...

891
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.310
to congratulate your grand opening.

892
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:38.079
It'll be a series. You can give medical consultations.

893
00:59:38.079 --> 00:59:39.210
Sure.

894
00:59:40.279 --> 00:59:41.980
But wait a minute.

895
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:43.650
I will...

896
00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.549
do it if you let Do Ah participate.

897
00:59:48.219 --> 00:59:49.219
Mr. Yoon.

898
00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:52.389
Not everyone thinks Do Ah is adorable.

899
00:59:52.389 --> 00:59:55.159
What are you talking about? She takes after me.

900
00:59:55.159 --> 00:59:57.889
- That's her flaw. Now, go home. - My goodness.

901
01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:15.610
I'm going to go do an interview.

902
01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:18.219
Where are you going? You have something to tell me.

903
01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:21.549
- No, I don't. - Yes, you do.

904
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:22.650
Go inside the meeting room.

905
01:00:23.049 --> 01:00:24.349
Hey, wait.

906
01:00:24.619 --> 01:00:27.090
You didn't shoot the probiotics ad yet, did you?

907
01:00:27.159 --> 01:00:28.630
- Why? - They want a doctor...

908
01:00:28.630 --> 01:00:29.759
to recommend the product.

909
01:00:29.929 --> 01:00:31.230
You know a pediatrician, right?

910
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:34.130
Yes, of course. I know a very nice pediatrician.

911
01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:36.299
I'll go bring him.

912
01:00:38.699 --> 01:00:40.369
Why don't you just call?

913
01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:43.110
Does she prefer to meet people face to face?

914
01:00:44.509 --> 01:00:45.610
Don't ask.

915
01:00:50.449 --> 01:00:51.520
Okay, great.

916
01:00:52.679 --> 01:00:53.820
How does it look?

917
01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:56.119
- It looks fine. - Seung Ho.

918
01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.650
Bring the doctor.

919
01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.159
Sir, we're going to do a test shoot.

920
01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.659
Come this way and stand right here.

921
01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.529
- Thank you. - Tell me the truth.

922
01:01:06.659 --> 01:01:09.170
You were that woman who tried to buy sperm, right?

923
01:01:10.029 --> 01:01:11.099
No.

924
01:01:11.869 --> 01:01:14.239
You're a very adventurous woman.

925
01:01:14.369 --> 01:01:15.840
Are you going to keep looking for someone's sperm?

926
01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:18.810
Why don't you just sleep with someone?

927
01:01:19.179 --> 01:01:22.150
Then things will get too complicated.

928
01:01:22.509 --> 01:01:24.710
It'll be a problem even if the guy offers to be the father.

929
01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:26.980
And if I have the baby without telling him,

930
01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:28.619
I might go to the fiery pit.

931
01:01:28.619 --> 01:01:30.250
That's against moral ethics.

932
01:01:31.719 --> 01:01:33.920
I just want to get someone's sperm with their consent...

933
01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.259
and have a baby.

934
01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.060
What? Like in Hollywood movies?

935
01:01:38.699 --> 01:01:40.929
They get it from a drunk colleague or a friend.

936
01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:48.369
I don't know any guys.

937
01:01:48.369 --> 01:01:49.969
- Hello. - My goodness.

938
01:01:49.969 --> 01:01:52.279
This is the product. It takes you straight to the bathroom.

939
01:01:52.279 --> 01:01:54.179
- Oh, I see. - Here. Take a look.

940
01:03:03.509 --> 01:03:06.320
(Oh My Baby)

941
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:07.949
Don't look her way.

942
01:03:07.949 --> 01:03:09.549
The look in her eyes is telling me...

943
01:03:09.549 --> 01:03:11.150
that a crazy idea is forming inside her head.

944
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:12.790
Acknowledge her now and you'll be in trouble.

945
01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:14.520
Where are you three going?

946
01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:16.489
Why would two friends be living together?

947
01:03:16.489 --> 01:03:17.860
It's not wrong at all, you know.

948
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:20.699
Especially given our close relationship.

949
01:03:20.699 --> 01:03:22.099
He's a dangerous one.

950
01:03:22.199 --> 01:03:23.529
He looks like a con artist.

951
01:03:23.529 --> 01:03:25.900
You think I'll fall for a bad boy...

952
01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:27.799
and burn myself?

953
01:03:27.799 --> 01:03:29.139
Only make mistakes with me, okay?

954
01:03:29.409 --> 01:03:32.110
I don't want you to fall for some random guy because you're lonely.

955
01:03:32.239 --> 01:03:35.679
Younger specimens would have better sperms, right?
