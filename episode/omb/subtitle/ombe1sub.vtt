00:00:46.656 --> 00:00:47.826
Ma'am, stay awake.

2
00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:49.656
Hang in there. We're almost there.

3
00:00:54.396 --> 00:00:56.725
You need to stay awake, okay? Yes, stay awake.

4
00:00:56.725 --> 00:00:59.495
Please stay focused. Okay, let's do this. Now, push!

5
00:00:59.596 --> 00:01:01.966
That's great! Good!

6
00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:04.106
You need to breathe. One more time. Push!

7
00:01:14.316 --> 00:01:16.686
Give me a long one. Push!

8
00:01:37.036 --> 00:01:38.936
Gosh, how adorable.

9
00:01:38.936 --> 00:01:40.476
Look at you.

10
00:01:40.476 --> 00:01:43.576
How are you so adorable? My goodness gracious.

11
00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:49.785
Ha Ri, your baby is so cute. Do you want to see?

12
00:01:50.015 --> 00:01:52.586
Come on. Let's go to your mommy, my dear.

13
00:01:52.815 --> 00:01:53.856
There's your mommy.

14
00:01:54.015 --> 00:01:56.386
Mommy. Mommy.

15
00:02:06.136 --> 00:02:07.295
That's your mommy.

16
00:02:12.576 --> 00:02:13.606
Mom!

17
00:02:22.285 --> 00:02:26.255
"Hello, I'm 39 years old, and I'm single."

18
00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:28.856
"I was single yesterday, and I'm single today."

19
00:02:28.856 --> 00:02:30.455
"So I'll probably be single tomorrow as well."

20
00:02:30.925 --> 00:02:33.696
"I haven't been able to meet a guy for a very long time."

21
00:02:33.696 --> 00:02:35.966
"And now, love is like a miracle that might never occur to me."

22
00:02:36.196 --> 00:02:39.265
"But I still have hope, so can you please show me..."

23
00:02:39.265 --> 00:02:41.765
"a small miracle by sending me some snacks?"

24
00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:46.105
Ms. Jang Ha Ri, I can totally relate.

25
00:02:46.206 --> 00:02:49.075
But let me tell you that the small miracle...

26
00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:51.415
you've desperately hoped for has come true.

27
00:02:51.415 --> 00:02:54.186
You won the draw, so you will be given...

28
00:02:54.186 --> 00:02:55.586
a box of snacks!

29
00:03:01.486 --> 00:03:04.695
Your name is Jang Ha Ri. You're 39.

30
00:03:04.695 --> 00:03:05.896
And you're single.

31
00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:08.426
You've had sex before, right?

32
00:03:08.665 --> 00:03:09.665
Yes.

33
00:03:09.796 --> 00:03:12.635
It was in 2010 during the Vancouver Winter Olympics.

34
00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:15.605
It was 10 years ago? So you didn't have sex recently?

35
00:03:16.535 --> 00:03:17.736
I did go on blind dates but...

36
00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:19.135
When did you finish your period?

37
00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:21.505
A month ago.

38
00:03:21.875 --> 00:03:23.105
It's time I have my next one.

39
00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:25.945
Recently, I started having very bad period cramps.

40
00:03:25.945 --> 00:03:28.445
Last month, I almost fainted due to the pain.

41
00:03:28.516 --> 00:03:30.116
I even had to go to the ER once.

42
00:03:32.155 --> 00:03:33.915
Then why didn't you get it checked?

43
00:03:34.456 --> 00:03:37.695
Well, I was too busy working day and night.

44
00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:43.796
I don't have much time today either, so I just want some painkillers...

45
00:03:43.796 --> 00:03:46.135
and go home after I take the AMH test.

46
00:03:46.236 --> 00:03:47.836
That means I just need to take a blood test, right?

47
00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:50.605
Your hormone levels will tell us the age of your ovaries...

48
00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:52.776
and how many eggs you have left.

49
00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:54.706
Do you plan to have babies?

50
00:03:55.605 --> 00:03:56.975
When are you getting married?

51
00:03:57.276 --> 00:03:59.075
I don't know when I'll get married.

52
00:03:59.216 --> 00:04:01.285
I'm more urgent to get pregnant than to get married.

53
00:04:01.815 --> 00:04:03.746
So I'd like to freeze my eggs.

54
00:04:04.415 --> 00:04:06.056
I want to freeze...

55
00:04:06.285 --> 00:04:09.426
a few of my healthiest eggs until I finally meet the one.

56
00:04:27.676 --> 00:04:28.746
Excuse me.

57
00:04:31.415 --> 00:04:32.415
Me?

58
00:04:33.845 --> 00:04:34.845
Yes?

59
00:04:36.716 --> 00:04:38.686
Is there a pharmacy nearby?

60
00:04:39.686 --> 00:04:40.755
A pharmacy?

61
00:04:42.255 --> 00:04:44.355
It's over there.

62
00:04:48.266 --> 00:04:50.426
Hey! I'm going to call the cops.

63
00:04:50.765 --> 00:04:52.996
Stay right there! Hey!

64
00:04:53.065 --> 00:04:55.005
My gosh. Hey!

65
00:05:13.385 --> 00:05:14.426
Hello?

66
00:05:14.885 --> 00:05:15.986
Help!

67
00:05:15.986 --> 00:05:18.096
There's a pervert here! Please help!

68
00:05:18.096 --> 00:05:19.426
- Hey! - He's over there!

69
00:05:19.426 --> 00:05:21.465
- Stop right there! - Is this the police?

70
00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:23.226
- Let's go. - Take him.

72

Ha Ri.

73
00:05:40.275 --> 00:05:42.145
Are you really going to freeze your eggs?

74
00:05:43.015 --> 00:05:46.416
Why do you want kids? I get sick of them just by looking at them.

75
00:05:46.616 --> 00:05:48.156
How is it possible to hate kids?

76
00:05:48.226 --> 00:05:50.085
I fall in love just by looking at them.

77
00:05:50.426 --> 00:05:52.625
It's hard to come across a woman like you.

78
00:05:52.695 --> 00:05:54.195
Who has babies these days?

79
00:05:54.695 --> 00:05:57.025
I wouldn't have married if my husband...

80
00:05:57.025 --> 00:05:58.296
insisted on having a child.

81
00:05:59.065 --> 00:06:01.606
How can you marry a man who doesn't want kids?

82
00:06:02.705 --> 00:06:03.765
There they are.

83
00:06:08.746 --> 00:06:09.806
Which one's better?

84
00:06:11.515 --> 00:06:12.875
- This one. - Okay.

85
00:06:13.616 --> 00:06:14.715
Nice.

86
00:06:15.215 --> 00:06:16.385
Why ask for my opinion then?

87
00:06:28.395 --> 00:06:30.866
- We're here. Hi, everyone. - Hello.

88
00:06:30.866 --> 00:06:33.695
- Welcome. - Hi, guys.

89
00:06:42.445 --> 00:06:43.546
You're here.

90
00:06:57.755 --> 00:06:59.255
Hi, Pororo.

91
00:07:00.395 --> 00:07:02.096
I see you're with a friend.

92
00:07:04.796 --> 00:07:09.005
You've been loved for 13 years now since your debut in 2003.

93
00:07:09.005 --> 00:07:10.765
What's your secret?

94
00:07:17.976 --> 00:07:20.976
Could you tell us why people find you so charming?

95
00:07:26.916 --> 00:07:30.226
Is there a reason why your goggles always stay on?

96
00:07:47.335 --> 00:07:49.606
I found him.

97
00:07:50.676 --> 00:07:51.846
Mr. Nam!

98
00:07:51.846 --> 00:07:53.145
Sang Hee, please don't run.

99
00:07:53.246 --> 00:07:54.846
- Mr. Nam! - My gosh.

100
00:07:55.515 --> 00:07:56.916
- I found him. - You did?

101
00:07:57.215 --> 00:07:58.616
He's on Outstagram.

102
00:07:59.486 --> 00:08:00.955
It's him, isn't it?

103
00:08:01.385 --> 00:08:03.125
Yes, it is Han I Sang.

104
00:08:03.686 --> 00:08:05.325
I see he's back in Korea.

105
00:08:06.296 --> 00:08:08.625
What on earth has he been up to though?

Then I guess I'm happy for him.

116
00:09:31.276 --> 00:09:34.845
Just don't mention him to Ms. Jang though.

00:09:36.615 --> 00:09:37.786
Why not?

118
00:09:39.855 --> 00:09:41.056

It's my house, not hers.

Don't worry about her and do whatever you want.

00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:42.266
No thanks.

182
00:12:53.345 --> 00:12:55.945
You have time for a marathon but not to call me?

183
00:12:56.046 --> 00:12:58.855
You have time to fly but not sit down with me?

184
00:12:58.855 --> 00:13:00.355
You have time to go to an amusement park...

185
00:13:00.355 --> 00:13:01.556
but not contact me?

186
00:13:01.556 --> 00:13:04.455
You have time to sew but not return any of my texts?

187
00:13:12.835 --> 00:13:13.965
Auntie!

188
00:13:18.105 --> 00:13:19.636
I can't believe I responded to that.

189
00:13:20.036 --> 00:13:22.605
Did he seriously just call you Auntie?

190
00:13:22.605 --> 00:13:24.705
Apparently, I'm the same age as his youngest aunt.

191
00:13:24.705 --> 00:13:27.115
Unbelievable. Does he not know that this is a workplace?

192
00:13:27.115 --> 00:13:28.886
Why haven't you said anything?

193
00:13:28.886 --> 00:13:30.186
How can I?

194
00:13:30.386 --> 00:13:32.416
I practically encouraged him myself.

195
00:13:33.328 --> 00:13:35.070
I can't suddenly blame it on the fact that I was drunk.

196
00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:37.381
If he's not too daft, he'll change his ways.

197
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.420
Are you back from your interview?

198
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.721
Well, I'm coming back from a meeting.

199
00:13:42.081 --> 00:13:43.420
I can hold my own in one now.

200
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.491
I'm proud of you.

201
00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:54.530
- What's wrong? - Menstrual cramps.

202
00:13:57.471 --> 00:13:59.800
I've been running errands for my mom when she's on her period.

203
00:13:59.971 --> 00:14:03.141
She taught me that menstruation is nothing to be ashamed of.

204
00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:06.711
Is it severe?

205
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:08.481
I can't get you any water right now.

206
00:14:09.241 --> 00:14:10.881
It's all right. Let me help.

207
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.381
This way.

208
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.721
Excuse me, but she has menstrual cramps.

209
00:14:15.721 --> 00:14:17.851
Could you hold the elevator for us?

210
00:14:19.190 --> 00:14:21.591
I'm sorry about this, but she has menstrual cramps. Be careful.

211
00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.591
Please let her cut in line. She has menstrual cramps.

212
00:14:25.861 --> 00:14:27.001
Careful.

213
00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.471
Are you all right? Is it bad?

214
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.530
Can you hold your head up?

215
00:14:33.001 --> 00:14:34.101
Are you sure you're all right?

216
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:36.070
What now?

217
00:14:37.371 --> 00:14:38.841
The elevator is here.

218
00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:41.780
Auntie, come on. We need to move.

219
00:14:41.881 --> 00:14:42.950
Sorry about this.

220
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:44.081
Going up.

221
00:14:44.081 --> 00:14:45.910
Just hang in there, all right?

222
00:14:46.011 --> 00:14:48.150
- What the... - What did my mom say again?

223
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.050
She described the pain as excruciating.

224
00:14:52.251 --> 00:14:53.690
Ms. Jang, hang in there.

225
00:14:54.091 --> 00:14:56.060
What do you do for menstrual cramps?

226
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.001
- Auntie, we're here. - Move! Out of my way.

227
00:15:06.871 --> 00:15:08.471
Unbelievable.

228
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:11.471
The pain must've been unbearable.

229
00:15:11.471 --> 00:15:12.641
Who is she?

230
00:15:13.741 --> 00:15:17.550
Oh, she's Deputy Manager Jang Ha Ri of "The Baby".

231
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:27.391
He can't take a hint at all, can he?

232
00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.091
I'm afraid Ha Ri will be stuck being called Auntie.

233
00:15:39.641 --> 00:15:41.040
(Use a wet towelllllllllll)

234
00:15:44.641 --> 00:15:46.711
(Recruitment Qualifications)

235
00:15:47.841 --> 00:15:49.650
Hyo Joo, come here for a second.

236
00:15:51.881 --> 00:15:53.481
- Hyo Joo. - Yes?

237
00:15:58.450 --> 00:15:59.660
What is this?

238
00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:02.190
"Infertility can be treated with herbal tonics."

239
00:16:02.591 --> 00:16:03.690
Is this what they wanted?

240
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.800
Dr. Ko said he's getting a patent for herbal tonic treatments,

241
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.900
and asked us to stress it.

242
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.530
Still, you can't write down whatever they say.

243
00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:12.631
Let's not get sued.

244
00:16:13.001 --> 00:16:15.101
We're already the ugly duckling in the company.

245
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.471
What choice do we have? It's Advertising's page.

246
00:16:21.881 --> 00:16:24.011
I'm too nice to fight.

247
00:16:35.391 --> 00:16:36.391
So Yoon.

248
00:16:48.471 --> 00:16:49.570
Sir.

249
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:52.611
You scared me.

250
00:16:53.111 --> 00:16:55.481
What? You're scaring me.

251
00:16:55.611 --> 00:16:57.981
Must we write Dr. Ko's advertisement piece like this?

252
00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.351
It's good.

253
00:17:04.621 --> 00:17:07.391
"It has an excellent effect on treating infertility."

254
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.690
That's how they wanted it written.

255
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.660
There you go again. Just because your name won't be on it.

256
00:17:11.891 --> 00:17:12.900
If people complain,

257
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.761
the reporter whose name is on it must take responsibility.

258
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.700
Seriously. Stop being so inflexible.

259
00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:24.341
They wanted to stop advertising with us. I worked really hard...

260
00:17:24.341 --> 00:17:25.571
to get this.

261
00:17:27.041 --> 00:17:28.240
Work with me.

262
00:17:29.811 --> 00:17:32.611
Some readers know these advertisement pieces are ads,

263
00:17:32.611 --> 00:17:34.920
but some believe the articles and go to them.

264
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:37.220
And it's about infertility. Imagine how desperate they must be.

265
00:17:37.291 --> 00:17:40.490
Will you be accountable if this is all a lie?

266
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.291
- Why should I be accountable? - Exactly, so I won't print it.

267
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.500
I really don't want to do this, but we'll lose the advertisement fee,

268
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.631
so I'll report this to the higher-ups.

269
00:17:52.631 --> 00:17:53.641
Go ahead.

270
00:18:02.641 --> 00:18:03.781
Come in.

271
00:18:05.581 --> 00:18:08.081
Ms. Jang wants to take out the ad.

272
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.950
- What? - The ad on herbal tonics...

273
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.260
Ms. Jang.

274
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:25.230
Ms. Jang, get up. Get up.

275
00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.301
Please get up.

276
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:38.010
Ms. Jang.

277
00:18:38.381 --> 00:18:42.021
I know I adore you, but you can't do this.

278
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.720
That's why I'm doing this.

279
00:18:47.061 --> 00:18:48.920
You impinge on my editing authority thoughtlessly,

280
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.031
so I'm going to lie here thoughtlessly as well.

281
00:18:56.031 --> 00:18:59.641
Strictly put, you're not the editor-in-chief.

282
00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:02.000
You're only the acting editor-in-chief.

283
00:19:02.101 --> 00:19:04.740
That's why I'm lying here in Ms. Shim's place.

284
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.641
Do you miss her? Shall I call her in?

285
00:19:06.641 --> 00:19:08.811
No, no, no, no.

286
00:19:09.851 --> 00:19:12.250
Why would you call in someone who's resting after having a baby?

287
00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:17.690
Ms. Jang.

288
00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.521
This is why you can't get married.

289
00:19:20.521 --> 00:19:22.260
Oh, my gosh. Again.

290
00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:26.131
You need to watch what you say before I make you pay.

291
00:19:32.131 --> 00:19:35.301
Fine. I get it, so get up. Let's talk.

292
00:19:37.571 --> 00:19:38.571
I'll remove the article.

293
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.781
Fine, but since Editing took it out,

294
00:19:41.781 --> 00:19:43.081
Editing must take responsibility.

295
00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.210
Yes, sir. We will.

296
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:47.821
Since it affects our department's income.

297
00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.551
Are you done?

298
00:19:49.791 --> 00:19:50.791
Yes, sir.

299
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:58.591
Ms. Jang. Stay and chat with me.

300
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:00.760
Yes, sir.

301
00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:07.240
Yes, sir.

302
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.391
I don't want to date you.

303
00:20:23.591 --> 00:20:26.490
You punk. I'm married with kids.

304
00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.760
It's been so long since I saw you. I'm happy, that's all.

305
00:20:29.891 --> 00:20:32.591
I even prepared your favorite liquor.

306
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.571
You haven't been to our studio in a while, right? Want a tour?

307
00:20:42.371 --> 00:20:44.470
- I looked around already. - Okay.

308
00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.740
I assume your trip was nice.

309
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.051
You'll get back to work, right?

310
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.121
- What? - Just because.

311
00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:01.960
I'm sure you'll get a lot of job offers...

312
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.190
although you took a long break.

313
00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:07.760
So I figure you'll need a studio as soon as possible.

314
00:21:09.531 --> 00:21:12.230
It'll be really hard to find a studio.

315
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.440
Rent shot up.

316
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.041
You need all new equipment too.

317
00:21:17.611 --> 00:21:19.440
I'm just thinking of you.

318
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.781
Things are bad overall,

319
00:21:22.111 --> 00:21:23.851
so I thought...

320
00:21:25.311 --> 00:21:27.680
it would be good to share the studio...

321
00:21:27.781 --> 00:21:29.021
with me.

322
00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.321
No.

323
00:21:37.391 --> 00:21:40.760
Isn't Jang Ha Ri working at "The Baby"?

324
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.801
My gosh. You even remember her name.

325
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:53.010
So Yoon, what happened to the story about the kid who picks his nose?

326
00:21:53.311 --> 00:21:54.680
I'm still picking at it.

327
00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.341
Stop picking at it, and give it to me.

328
00:21:56.341 --> 00:21:57.680
Hyo Joo, what are you working on?

329
00:21:58.611 --> 00:22:01.180
- Breast pumps. - Stop squeezing it out. Finish it.

330
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.220
Yeon Ho?

331
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.121
I'm almost done with the constipation piece.

332
00:22:04.291 --> 00:22:06.190
Sure. It's time to stop going.

333
00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:09.361
Ha Ri, can we take a break?

334
00:22:10.031 --> 00:22:12.131
I'm starving.

335
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.331
Should we have a snack?

336
00:22:17.071 --> 00:22:20.141
- Yes. - Thank goodness.

337
00:22:21.871 --> 00:22:23.940
Was there anything else?

338
00:22:24.141 --> 00:22:26.071
Like jewelry or clothes?

339
00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:29.041
You know I made my personal woes public...

340
00:22:29.041 --> 00:22:30.650
just to feed you guys.

341
00:22:30.851 --> 00:22:33.551
They must have really pitied you if they chose your story.

342
00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.391
So Yoon, you have unparalleled skill in hurting people's feelings.

343
00:22:39.021 --> 00:22:40.061
Don't be so sensitive.

344
00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:42.190
Why don't you have a boyfriend?

345
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.801
You're attractive and successful.

346
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.071
Are you too picky?

347
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.571
Hey. What do you take her for?

348
00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:56.841
She may not look it,

349
00:22:58.041 --> 00:22:59.611
but she falls in love easily.

350
00:23:00.641 --> 00:23:01.910
She falls for any old schmoe.

351
00:23:03.581 --> 00:23:04.650
She's easy.

352
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.321
That's right. I'm super easy, but still, right?

353
00:23:08.381 --> 00:23:09.781
That one was the best.

354
00:23:09.891 --> 00:23:12.450
She fell for a guy in front of the studio in three seconds.

355
00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:14.821
Just how hot was he?

356
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.990
Hey.

357
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.000
He wasn't hot.

358
00:23:22.831 --> 00:23:25.900
He was crying.

359
00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.631
I never saw a guy cry before.

360
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.000
They say a man's tears...

361
00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.710
make the heart cry.

362
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.480
I thought she was a total psycho.

363
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:46.081
Psycho? She's not that bad.

364
00:24:46.081 --> 00:24:47.551
You didn't see the look in her eyes.

365
00:24:48.121 --> 00:24:49.220
And I don't want to.

366
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:54.260
I don't like aggressive girls.

367
00:24:55.321 --> 00:24:57.391
So? Did you hit on him?

368
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.591
He was a psycho.

369
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.871
Forget men. I need to have kids.

370
00:25:04.871 --> 00:25:07.900
What should I do? I'm turning 40 next year.

371
00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.641
You can get married quickly and have a baby right away.

372
00:25:11.871 --> 00:25:13.781
With whom? Where and how will she meet him?

373
00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:15.841
Sign up for a matchmaking service.

374
00:25:15.841 --> 00:25:19.381
I used to be a VVIP at Get Married because I was "marriage material".

375
00:25:19.381 --> 00:25:21.621
Now, I get calls from second marriage services.

376
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:25.750
Girls. Stop saying useless things.

377
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:27.720
Find a good-looking rich guy.

378
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.831
Good-looking rich guys will never date old women.

379
00:25:30.831 --> 00:25:31.861
Agreed.

380
00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:34.801
- Not a chance. - Choi Hyo Joo.

381
00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.960
Yes?

382
00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:38.331
You don't know the half of it.

383
00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:41.601
It's hard to even date a normal guy.

384
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.071
The only decent guy I can date at my age is either already married...

385
00:25:45.071 --> 00:25:46.210
or dead.

386
00:25:49.811 --> 00:25:51.611
Who gets married these days?

387
00:25:51.811 --> 00:25:53.980
You should just stay single all your life.

388
00:25:57.021 --> 00:25:58.121
What?

389
00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:01.621
She... She's right. My friend doesn't date either.

390
00:26:01.791 --> 00:26:06.391
She thinks it's pathetic to be obsessed with dating and marriage.

391
00:26:07.801 --> 00:26:10.670
Then am I going against the current trend?

392
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.000
I guess you could say that.

393
00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:13.641
It looks like Generation Z has a hard time understanding you.

394
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.200
- Right? - Yes.

395
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.700
I hate her the most.

396
00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:18.740
The problem might be...

397
00:26:19.371 --> 00:26:22.210
that you're too obsessed with marriage and having babies.

398
00:26:23.581 --> 00:26:25.210
Gosh, I'm so tired.

399
00:26:25.781 --> 00:26:27.750
I'm so exhausted.

400
00:26:35.291 --> 00:26:36.720
Should I tell you guys a scary story?

401
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.131
I'm your future.

402
00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:50.541
How is she my future?

403
00:26:50.541 --> 00:26:52.041
Why would I end up like her?

404
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:55.541
You guys are in big trouble.

405
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.450
Let's see.

406
00:27:02.521 --> 00:27:04.250
Is the new editor-in-chief single?

407
00:27:04.391 --> 00:27:06.591
You say you understand women who just became mothers.

408
00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:07.990
But I can easily tell you're not married.

409
00:27:11.361 --> 00:27:14.000
What does a single woman know about childcare?

410
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.361
Is a single woman allowed to write articles about childcare?

411
00:27:16.361 --> 00:27:18.000
A mother can't be a journalist.

412
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.230
The job requires too much overtime work,

413
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:20.341
and you can barely even go home.

414
00:27:24.571 --> 00:27:26.710
What they say in magazines are all true.

415
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:29.010
But it's hard to do what they say when you actually become a mother.

416
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:32.750
Reading about childcare is different from actual childcare.

417
00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:35.980
But you wouldn't know since you're not a mother.

418
00:27:37.791 --> 00:27:42.460
Ms. Jang, why don't you move to "Unique" or "The House"?

419
00:27:43.891 --> 00:27:46.230
You've been working at "The Baby" for way too long.

420
00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:50.230
It'll be hard to get promoted once Ms. Shim returns.

421
00:27:50.571 --> 00:27:53.601
And even if the position for editor-in-chief becomes vacant,

422
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.500
you won't be able to get the position.

423
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:57.141
You know...

424
00:27:57.141 --> 00:28:00.210
single women can't become the editor-in-chief of "The Baby".

425
00:28:04.081 --> 00:28:06.381
It's not like I'll never get married.

426
00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.351
- What? - I want to have a baby.

427
00:28:10.521 --> 00:28:12.450
Once I start dating, I'll get pregnant before the wedding.

428
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:15.861
And when is that going to be?

429
00:28:18.391 --> 00:28:21.260
Don't stay at a place where there's a slim chance for you to grow.

430
00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:25.170
Go to a place where you could become an editor-in-chief.

431
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:28.470
I'm telling you this for your own sake.

432
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.091
Ha Ri rarely even comes by.

433
00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.720
She's a deputy manager, so you guys won't even meet.

434
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:49.321
My gosh.

435
00:28:50.391 --> 00:28:51.591
Did you find a place to live?

436
00:28:52.891 --> 00:28:56.160
I moved in today. It's near the park in Hangang-dong.

437
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.071
"Hangang-dong"? "The park"?

438
00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:05.141
Why does it have to be Ha Ri's neighborhood?

439
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.381
- Hello. - Hey, welcome.

440
00:29:17.051 --> 00:29:18.551
I'm glad you're here.

441
00:29:18.551 --> 00:29:20.460
- Have you been well? - Yes, of course.

444
00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:26.891
That's today's new menu.

445
00:29:27.631 --> 00:29:29.561
The Pacific saury gratin. It doesn't taste that fishy.

446
00:29:29.561 --> 00:29:30.970
- You should try it. - Sure.

447
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:39.170
I'll get you a new pair of chopsticks.

448
00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:40.480
It sounds delicious.

449
00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:53.690
- How did it taste? - It... It was delicious.

450
00:29:54.391 --> 00:29:56.091
- Thank you for the food. - No problem.

453

- Here's the Pacific saury gratin. - Thanks.

454
00:30:09.571 --> 00:30:11.470
- Enjoy. - Okay. Thank you.

My goodness.

456
00:30:25.321 --> 00:30:26.490
Oh, gosh.

457
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:46.141
If you drink this, it means we're going out.

458
00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:51.351
What if I don't drink it?

459
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.480
Then we won't ever meet again.

460
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.301
I'm jealous.

461
00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.131
There you are.

462
00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:45.071
No! Please!

463
00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.010
Mom?

464
00:32:41.727 --> 00:32:42.828
Hey!

465
00:32:49.068 --> 00:32:51.278
- Hey, you're here. - My gosh.

466
00:32:56.207 --> 00:32:57.348
What are you doing here?

467
00:32:58.048 --> 00:32:59.318
I moved here yesterday.

468
00:33:00.048 --> 00:33:01.147
Move where?

469
00:33:01.747 --> 00:33:03.288
- You moved into our house? - Yes.

470
00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:06.358
Why? Why would you move into our house?

471
00:33:06.417 --> 00:33:08.058
I'm a resident here.

472
00:33:11.757 --> 00:33:12.997
That's absurd.

473
00:33:16.128 --> 00:33:18.768
Hey, did my mom let you rent this place?

474
00:33:18.967 --> 00:33:21.237
She was the one who offered to let me live here.

475
00:33:21.437 --> 00:33:23.208
She never told me anything about his.

476
00:33:24.007 --> 00:33:26.538
You must be tired. Let's eat breakfast.

477
00:33:26.978 --> 00:33:28.708
No, it's okay. I don't need to...

478
00:33:28.877 --> 00:33:29.978
Hey!

479
00:33:31.547 --> 00:33:33.748
Are you joking with me? Get out.

480
00:33:46.098 --> 00:33:47.398
I have nowhere to go.

481
00:33:49.467 --> 00:33:51.337
Did you lose the house to Jeong Won?

482
00:33:52.197 --> 00:33:53.337
What's your problem?

483
00:33:53.337 --> 00:33:55.567
Why would I lose the house? We got divorced because of her.

484
00:33:55.708 --> 00:33:58.438
She even paid back the money she borrowed as alimony.

485
00:33:58.438 --> 00:33:59.978
At least she had some conscience.

486
00:34:00.447 --> 00:34:02.478
- That nasty brat. - Yes, she's a nasty brat.

487
00:34:02.808 --> 00:34:04.348
How could she do that to me?

488
00:34:05.418 --> 00:34:06.877
But you have no conscience.

489
00:34:07.748 --> 00:34:10.757
You show up in five years and have the guts to chat with me?

490
00:34:13.018 --> 00:34:14.927
How could you look at me like nothing ever happened?

491
00:34:21.927 --> 00:34:23.467
Then I won't look at you.

492
00:34:25.638 --> 00:34:26.737
My gosh.

493
00:34:26.898 --> 00:34:28.067
To be honest,

494
00:34:29.107 --> 00:34:32.107
I just can't seem to raise my daughter all by myself.

495
00:34:32.507 --> 00:34:34.978
My parents want me to live with them in the States.

496
00:34:35.507 --> 00:34:38.148
But how can I?

497
00:34:39.578 --> 00:34:42.987
My friend, you're the only one I can trust and rely on.

498
00:34:43.987 --> 00:34:45.058
After all this time?

499
00:34:45.618 --> 00:34:47.328
Jeong Won hated my guts,

500
00:34:47.328 --> 00:34:49.728
so you didn't think twice about cutting me from your life.

501
00:34:50.398 --> 00:34:52.098
But now that she has left you,

502
00:34:52.098 --> 00:34:55.268
you come back to me pretending like nothing happened?

503
00:34:58.438 --> 00:35:00.407
My daughter Do Ah is in the other room.

504
00:35:01.907 --> 00:35:05.177
Talk to me again once you've said hello.

505
00:35:08.107 --> 00:35:09.677
Unbelievable.

506
00:35:20.288 --> 00:35:22.027
You must be Do Ah.

507
00:35:22.987 --> 00:35:25.728
Gosh, you're a sweetheart.

508
00:35:31.567 --> 00:35:33.067
Do you not wash your own kid?

509
00:35:34.407 --> 00:35:37.177
Babies are supposed to be messy like this.

510
00:35:37.407 --> 00:35:39.078
This is practically normal.

511
00:35:40.078 --> 00:35:42.078
Why is her bottle so small?

512
00:35:42.177 --> 00:35:45.317
At eight months, she should be having at least 240ml.

513
00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:47.388
How did you know...

514
00:35:47.748 --> 00:35:49.148
that Do Ah's eight months old?

515
00:35:49.688 --> 00:35:52.657
You drew a short straw when it comes to Dads.

516
00:35:52.987 --> 00:35:54.228
Gosh, you poor thing.

517
00:35:54.228 --> 00:35:57.228
I feel bad for you, Do Ah.

518
00:35:58.927 --> 00:36:00.498
She's adorable, isn't she?

519
00:36:00.728 --> 00:36:03.498
Yes, and that's why I'm giving you a day.

520
00:36:03.598 --> 00:36:05.038
You have until tomorrow to leave.

521
00:36:05.197 --> 00:36:07.567
Really? When she's this adorable?

522
00:36:07.668 --> 00:36:09.268
When she's only eight months old?

523
00:36:10.007 --> 00:36:11.277
When we have nowhere else to go?

524
00:36:12.208 --> 00:36:15.607
All right. I have a deadline to meet, so I'll be back at 2am.

525
00:36:15.607 --> 00:36:17.447
Leave the baby and move out.

526
00:36:17.978 --> 00:36:19.677
Give her back or I'll call the police.

527
00:36:24.757 --> 00:36:26.688
She was scary, wasn't she?

528
00:36:28.257 --> 00:36:29.288
Nasty lady!

529
00:36:30.998 --> 00:36:32.027
Please don't cry.

530
00:36:46.038 --> 00:36:47.478
You're actually Jae Young's mom, aren't you?

531
00:36:50.177 --> 00:36:51.748
It killed me...

532
00:36:52.177 --> 00:36:55.148
to see him go from dandy to scruffy.

533
00:36:55.148 --> 00:36:57.587
We'll make room for him at mealtime...

534
00:36:57.757 --> 00:36:59.817
and see if he's feeding his daughter properly.

535
00:36:59.817 --> 00:37:02.757
He's also been drowning himself in alcohol, so we can stop that.

536
00:37:02.958 --> 00:37:04.027
Why is that so difficult?

537
00:37:04.127 --> 00:37:06.398
He got divorced, not terminally ill.

538
00:37:06.398 --> 00:37:08.498
Why do we need to take care of him?

539
00:37:09.797 --> 00:37:12.438
Okay, fine. He can leave, but I'm kicking you out too.

540
00:37:13.567 --> 00:37:14.768
What? Why?

541
00:37:14.837 --> 00:37:16.708
It's my house, not yours.

542
00:37:17.337 --> 00:37:19.877
I let you live there rent-free, but you're acting like the owner.

543
00:37:19.907 --> 00:37:22.407
Who are you to dictate whom I give my room out to?

544
00:37:22.748 --> 00:37:25.677
You're really his mom, aren't you? Only that would make sense.

545
00:37:26.317 --> 00:37:28.087
I actually wouldn't mind swapping kids.

546
00:37:29.047 --> 00:37:31.087
Now, hang up. I need to get back to my workout.

547
00:37:49.808 --> 00:37:50.907
The stage of childbirth?

548
00:37:50.907 --> 00:37:53.737
The government is supporting more infertile couples now,

549
00:37:53.737 --> 00:37:56.107
so I thought we could choose an infertile couple,

550
00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:58.648
have the government pay for the procedure,

551
00:37:58.648 --> 00:38:01.248
and write an in-depth piece until they give birth.

552
00:38:01.688 --> 00:38:03.388
Sounds great.

553
00:38:04.257 --> 00:38:06.918
You know the program where one experiences pregnancy?

554
00:38:07.188 --> 00:38:09.888
My superior actually suggested something new.

555
00:38:10.388 --> 00:38:13.328
Should you accept it,

556
00:38:13.328 --> 00:38:15.627
pitching your idea would become easier.

557
00:38:17.337 --> 00:38:18.337
What's this new idea?

558
00:38:18.398 --> 00:38:21.567
Fathers-to-be experiencing pregnancy is getting old.

559
00:38:21.768 --> 00:38:24.638
My superior quietly suggested...

560
00:38:24.638 --> 00:38:27.848
how fresh it'd be for a journalist to write an in-depth piece...

561
00:38:27.978 --> 00:38:30.348
on how it is to be pregnant.

562
00:38:33.578 --> 00:38:34.587
Goodness.

563
00:38:36.888 --> 00:38:37.987
Why me though?

564
00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:44.598
Are you going to smile or not?

565
00:38:45.458 --> 00:38:48.168
Must I go this far to bring in money for advertisement?

566
00:38:48.567 --> 00:38:51.598
I'll make sure that everyone knows of your sacrifice.

567
00:38:52.138 --> 00:38:55.938
Let's think of the bundle of joy in your oven and smile.

568
00:38:56.507 --> 00:38:57.978
Smile!

569
00:38:58.808 --> 00:39:01.578
- Its name is Unexpected. - My goodness.

570
00:39:01.978 --> 00:39:03.547
That's a scary name for an unborn baby.

571
00:39:03.547 --> 00:39:05.947
It's because the baby came to me unexpectedly.

572
00:39:06.118 --> 00:39:08.987
Since that's the case, give me an unexpected smile.

573
00:39:09.118 --> 00:39:10.248
Over here.

574
00:39:10.248 --> 00:39:11.458
- All right. - Hurry.

575
00:39:11.458 --> 00:39:13.987
- Smile! - Ha Ri, you look great.

576
00:39:13.987 --> 00:39:15.757
- Over here. - Smile!

577
00:39:15.757 --> 00:39:17.458
- Let's smile. - Ha Ri, smile.

578
00:39:17.927 --> 00:39:20.098
- Smile. - That's the spirit.

579
00:39:23.627 --> 00:39:25.768
- Do we have the shot? - Let's look.

580
00:39:25.967 --> 00:39:27.098
How does it look?

581
00:39:29.208 --> 00:39:30.407
It's good, right?

582
00:39:30.538 --> 00:39:32.578
- Do we have it? We got it. - The one before is better.

583
00:39:46.857 --> 00:39:47.958
Why not?

584
00:39:48.757 --> 00:39:51.558
Leave it on. I'll wear it on my way home.

585
00:39:52.357 --> 00:39:53.657
I'd rather have the full experience.

586
00:40:12.078 --> 00:40:13.418
Are things all right at the studio?

587
00:40:13.547 --> 00:40:15.388
It seems like he can barely hire you.

588
00:40:16.188 --> 00:40:18.317
He's sharing the space to keep up with the rent.

589
00:40:19.487 --> 00:40:21.828
- I heard I Sang's name. - Who?

590
00:40:22.357 --> 00:40:24.357
Why? How do you two know each other?

591
00:40:24.527 --> 00:40:25.998
- I don't know him. - They went on a blind date.

592
00:40:26.728 --> 00:40:28.527
You two were set up on a date?

593
00:40:28.868 --> 00:40:30.067
That's not the case.

594
00:40:30.797 --> 00:40:32.797
He cursed her, you know.

595
00:40:32.938 --> 00:40:34.708
He put a nail right through her heart.

596
00:40:34.708 --> 00:40:35.768
What?

597
00:40:35.768 --> 00:40:38.038
I truly believe that it's the reason why...

598
00:40:38.038 --> 00:40:39.978
you haven't been able to date.

599
00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:42.877
Must he really be mentioned at this moment?

600
00:40:42.877 --> 00:40:45.277
I'm exhausted as it is, you know.

601
00:40:46.018 --> 00:40:47.918
Just a second. Let's pose here.

602
00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:57.657
I saw him once before, and he seemed okay.

603
00:40:57.857 --> 00:41:00.027
He's a lunatic in disguise.

604
00:41:04.297 --> 00:41:05.398
That's the guy?

605
00:41:06.567 --> 00:41:09.708
Han I Sang. He's one of the hottest photographers right now,

606
00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:11.837
and he's two years older than you.

607
00:41:14.777 --> 00:41:15.978
How should I put this?

608
00:41:16.578 --> 00:41:18.748
It seems like he has a story to tell.

609
00:41:20.447 --> 00:41:21.817
Is that a deal-breaker?

610
00:41:21.848 --> 00:41:23.717
It'll be odd not to have one at that age.

611
00:41:24.157 --> 00:41:25.487
No wonder my radar spotted him.

612
00:41:25.558 --> 00:41:28.157
- Are you sure about this? - Not everyone is perfect.

613
00:41:28.288 --> 00:41:29.788
All that matters is that he's sane.

614
00:41:30.157 --> 00:41:32.598
Hold on a second then. I haven't talked to him...

615
00:41:32.598 --> 00:41:34.328
- since he got back from overseas. - Sure.

616
00:41:34.328 --> 00:41:36.027
- Stay right here. - Got it.

617
00:41:43.638 --> 00:41:45.478
I see you came ready for business.

618
00:41:45.478 --> 00:41:47.808
Will you finally be getting married next year?

619
00:41:47.808 --> 00:41:51.277
Well, if he's the right guy, then I'll sink my teeth in him.

620
00:41:51.978 --> 00:41:55.288
Remember the woman I mentioned? She's right there.

621
00:42:06.127 --> 00:42:07.157
What's wrong with her?

622
00:42:08.268 --> 00:42:09.627
She's just shy, that's all.

623
00:42:09.697 --> 00:42:12.598
I promised to set her up with a dashing bachelor.

624
00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:14.407
I'm not interested in marriage.

625
00:42:15.538 --> 00:42:16.607
Since when?

626
00:42:17.538 --> 00:42:19.438
- This moment. - Why?

627
00:42:19.638 --> 00:42:22.308
I should date him for a year before tying the knot, right?

628
00:42:23.208 --> 00:42:24.918
You haven't even met him yet.

629
00:42:24.918 --> 00:42:27.817
Exactly. We'll meet today, date for a year,

630
00:42:27.817 --> 00:42:29.348
and get married next year.

631
00:42:29.648 --> 00:42:30.857
Why must one get married?

632
00:42:30.987 --> 00:42:32.458
Because it gets lonely.

633
00:42:32.458 --> 00:42:33.618
Being single is easier.

634
00:42:33.618 --> 00:42:35.058
How can you live without family?

635
00:42:35.627 --> 00:42:38.027
I'd like a husband who I can call my best friend...

636
00:42:38.027 --> 00:42:40.797
and have 2 sons and 2 daughters.

637
00:42:40.797 --> 00:42:43.067
Since I'm too old though, I'll settle for two kids.

638
00:42:43.098 --> 00:42:45.138
I'm not interested in a nagging wife.

639
00:42:45.337 --> 00:42:46.768
I'd rather earn enough money for myself,

640
00:42:46.768 --> 00:42:48.967
be clear of children invading my life,

641
00:42:50.208 --> 00:42:52.177
and stick to having the TV to myself.

642
00:42:52.237 --> 00:42:55.607
I hear you, so look into his eyes and have his gaze locked on you.

643
00:42:55.777 --> 00:42:56.848
You know how an audience is like.

644
00:42:57.047 --> 00:42:59.978
"Really? My goodness." Be excited about what he says.

645
00:42:59.978 --> 00:43:02.118
While you do that,

646
00:43:02.118 --> 00:43:04.288
touch him gently and subtly.

647
00:43:04.288 --> 00:43:05.888
Touch him when we just met?

648
00:43:05.888 --> 00:43:08.587
Ha Ri, touching is Flirting 101.

649
00:43:08.987 --> 00:43:11.427
One lingering touch...

650
00:43:11.427 --> 00:43:13.797
led to my first kiss with my husband.

651
00:43:13.797 --> 00:43:14.868
A kiss?

652
00:43:16.067 --> 00:43:17.567
But we're not even in love yet.

653
00:43:18.967 --> 00:43:22.308
Why do people value marriage as a priority?

654
00:43:22.308 --> 00:43:24.377
It's not just old-fashioned but despicable.

655
00:43:24.377 --> 00:43:26.737
Are we cavemen trying to preserve our species?

656
00:43:27.377 --> 00:43:29.348
Fine. Unbelievable.

657
00:43:29.978 --> 00:43:31.018
I get it.

658
00:43:32.348 --> 00:43:34.447
Let's not talk about it anymore, okay?

659
00:43:41.288 --> 00:43:44.027
Goodness, your biceps.

660
00:44:27.538 --> 00:44:28.938
You must like the snow.

661
00:44:29.337 --> 00:44:30.507
I do.

662
00:44:30.978 --> 00:44:32.138
Me too.

663
00:44:33.078 --> 00:44:35.648
- Mr. Nam... - Soo Chul...

664
00:44:36.877 --> 00:44:39.478
I heard you're college alums with Mr. Nam.

665
00:44:42.587 --> 00:44:43.688
I am.

666
00:44:46.217 --> 00:44:49.357
I'm Jang Ha Ri. I'm a reporter with "The Baby".

667
00:44:50.527 --> 00:44:51.627
It's nice to meet you.

668
00:44:52.728 --> 00:44:54.567
I see. It's nice for you. Same here.

669
00:44:58.438 --> 00:45:01.967
One lingering touch led to my first kiss with my husband.

670
00:45:04.308 --> 00:45:07.208
I hear you're a great photographer.

671
00:45:07.208 --> 00:45:10.907
Is your expertise in magazine advertisements?

672
00:45:14.447 --> 00:45:15.587
What are you doing?

673
00:45:20.118 --> 00:45:22.857
You made a big impression on me when I first saw you.

674
00:45:24.598 --> 00:45:25.697
What's your deal?

675
00:45:27.157 --> 00:45:29.027
- Pardon? - You have no fear.

676
00:45:29.427 --> 00:45:30.967
What if I'm a bad guy?

677
00:45:32.697 --> 00:45:34.197
You're not a bad guy.

678
00:45:34.638 --> 00:45:36.268
You don't look like one.

679
00:45:36.467 --> 00:45:37.708
I can tell.

680
00:45:39.237 --> 00:45:42.047
Are you saying you can tell, so you fell in love at first sight?

681
00:45:42.978 --> 00:45:44.918
If you felt like destiny was drawing you to me...

682
00:45:46.547 --> 00:45:47.788
That's even sillier.

683
00:45:48.348 --> 00:45:51.558
Excuse me. All I did was introduce myself.

684
00:45:52.817 --> 00:45:54.627
Who introduces themselves so aggressively?

685
00:45:55.388 --> 00:45:58.857
If you felt anything for me, it's desire triggered by hormones.

686
00:45:58.958 --> 00:46:01.598
So don't hypnotize yourself with some romantic fantasy.

687
00:46:05.668 --> 00:46:07.237
Wait, so...

688
00:46:08.668 --> 00:46:10.507
are you saying I gave you...

689
00:46:10.507 --> 00:46:12.978
a look filled with desire inviting you to do something?

690
00:46:14.648 --> 00:46:16.677
You're not all that.

691
00:46:18.217 --> 00:46:21.717
Ms. Jang Ha Ri. I know we just met, but let me give you some advice.

692
00:46:24.817 --> 00:46:26.018
If you're lonely,

693
00:46:32.297 --> 00:46:33.828
get a dog.

694
00:46:50.907 --> 00:46:52.047
I realized...

695
00:46:52.877 --> 00:46:54.447
he was a real psycho.

696
00:46:58.188 --> 00:47:01.357
Do you have one with two stripes...

697
00:47:01.927 --> 00:47:03.188
right around here?

698
00:47:03.958 --> 00:47:06.027
No, that's the only design.

699
00:47:06.027 --> 00:47:10.127
It would be nice if the fabric had a sheen...

700
00:47:10.398 --> 00:47:13.768
and some embroidery around here.

701
00:47:13.998 --> 00:47:15.067
Do you have something like that?

702
00:47:16.808 --> 00:47:19.107
- No, we don't. - I see.

703
00:47:19.638 --> 00:47:21.078
You don't have much.

704
00:47:21.478 --> 00:47:25.217
- That narcissistic pig. - Seriously.

705
00:47:26.177 --> 00:47:27.447
Don't worry.

706
00:47:27.518 --> 00:47:30.217
He's so popular, he's getting his own studio.

707
00:47:30.447 --> 00:47:31.788
Thank goodness.

708
00:47:31.987 --> 00:47:34.317
Even if I run into him and by chance he recognizes me,

709
00:47:34.317 --> 00:47:35.757
I'll pretend I don't.

710
00:47:55.584 --> 00:47:58.354
Darn it. I lost my timing to avoid him.

711
00:48:09.164 --> 00:48:10.294
Get a dog.

712
00:48:47.303 --> 00:48:48.434
Long time...

713
00:48:52.274 --> 00:48:53.704
I almost said, "Long time no see."

714
00:48:59.213 --> 00:49:02.783
(Moai Stone Family Limited Release Pre-sale)

715
00:49:06.184 --> 00:49:07.653
What did he say? Did he recognize you?

716
00:49:08.354 --> 00:49:10.624
I ignored him first.

717
00:49:12.024 --> 00:49:13.693
I thought you said something...

718
00:49:13.693 --> 00:49:16.823
- Hey. - Stop faking it.

719
00:49:18.133 --> 00:49:19.193
No...

720
00:49:20.164 --> 00:49:22.003
Again? Does it hurt a lot?

721
00:49:22.963 --> 00:49:24.704
Go ahead.

722
00:49:24.803 --> 00:49:26.133
I'll take some meds and head to the office.

723
00:49:26.133 --> 00:49:27.303
Give me that.

724
00:49:27.974 --> 00:49:29.244
Goodness.

725
00:49:31.244 --> 00:49:32.343
What's wrong with her?

726
00:49:33.044 --> 00:49:34.113
Menstrual cramps.

727
00:49:35.483 --> 00:49:37.684
- Let's go. - But...

728
00:49:48.423 --> 00:49:49.494
Darn it.

729
00:50:09.883 --> 00:50:12.954
It's okay. Go on.

730
00:50:14.983 --> 00:50:16.084
Gosh.

731
00:50:16.084 --> 00:50:17.894
It was on sale.

732
00:50:17.894 --> 00:50:18.994
That was a good buy.

733
00:50:21.524 --> 00:50:25.593
Oh, my gosh. I think her water broke!

734
00:50:25.794 --> 00:50:28.803
Oh, no! You need to get to the hospital!

735
00:50:30.204 --> 00:50:31.434
That's not it.

736
00:50:32.474 --> 00:50:34.503
She must be having contractions!

737
00:50:34.604 --> 00:50:35.673
Should we call you an ambulance?

738
00:50:35.673 --> 00:50:38.374
She should go to the hospital where her doctor is.

739
00:50:39.213 --> 00:50:40.983
The baby won't come right away. It's your first, right?

740
00:50:40.983 --> 00:50:43.544
- No. That's not it... - Is it your second baby?

741
00:50:43.954 --> 00:50:46.584
- Don't they come faster? - They do.

742
00:50:46.753 --> 00:50:48.854
No, it's not a baby...

743
00:50:49.454 --> 00:50:50.994
It's her third!

744
00:50:51.124 --> 00:50:54.923
Oh, my gosh! She's so tough! She's a real patriot!

745
00:50:54.923 --> 00:50:57.434
- You need to get to a hospital. - No.

746
00:50:57.463 --> 00:51:00.033
- Let's go. To the elevator. - No. That's not it.

747
00:51:00.164 --> 00:51:03.133
- Elevator. - Elevator. Hurry!

748
00:51:03.334 --> 00:51:05.803
- That's not it. - Why is it so slow?

749
00:51:05.803 --> 00:51:08.343
- Let's take the escalator. - That's not it.

750
00:51:08.503 --> 00:51:09.943
We should take the elevator.

751
00:51:09.943 --> 00:51:12.173
But it isn't coming!

752
00:51:12.173 --> 00:51:15.314
- Move! She's having a baby! - Out of the way!

753
00:51:15.483 --> 00:51:17.983
- Are you okay? - We're almost there.

754
00:51:18.053 --> 00:51:19.153
Oh, no.

755
00:51:19.253 --> 00:51:23.124
- Mister! Just a minute! - I'm not preg...

756
00:51:23.124 --> 00:51:26.553
Mister! She's having contractions. Sorry.

757
00:51:26.624 --> 00:51:28.124
Are you okay?

758
00:51:28.323 --> 00:51:30.863
Okay, good. Excuse us.

759
00:51:31.133 --> 00:51:32.233
Okay.

760
00:51:35.733 --> 00:51:37.974
"Mister"? I'm not that old.

761
00:51:42.003 --> 00:51:45.343
- Hang in there. - I'm okay.

762
00:51:45.443 --> 00:51:47.883
- You are not. - I'm fine.

763
00:51:47.883 --> 00:51:50.044
- Oh, no. - Listen to me.

764
00:51:50.283 --> 00:51:52.184
- My gosh. - Let me go.

765
00:51:55.024 --> 00:51:56.553
- Please let go. - Where's our car?

766
00:51:56.553 --> 00:51:58.994
I'm telling you, it's definitely that way!

767
00:51:58.994 --> 00:52:00.423
No, it's over here.

768
00:52:00.894 --> 00:52:02.724
Where is it?

769
00:52:03.224 --> 00:52:04.963
Where? Hey. Where is it?

770
00:52:05.693 --> 00:52:08.303
- I'm telling you, it's this way. - That's not it.

771
00:52:08.704 --> 00:52:10.903
- Hang on. - Listen to me.

772
00:52:10.903 --> 00:52:13.233
They all look the same.

773
00:52:14.104 --> 00:52:16.343
- Where is it? - That's not it.

774
00:52:16.343 --> 00:52:17.713
Excuse me. Let me help.

775
00:52:28.124 --> 00:52:29.483
Thank you!

776
00:52:30.024 --> 00:52:31.323
That's great.

777
00:52:32.124 --> 00:52:34.693
Good luck. Be strong!

778
00:52:36.294 --> 00:52:39.633
- Where's your hospital? - Why are they doing this to me?

779
00:52:39.633 --> 00:52:41.033
Don't worry. I'll take you there.

780
00:52:41.033 --> 00:52:42.733
No, I'm okay.

781
00:52:44.934 --> 00:52:48.003
- Good luck! - Good luck!

782
00:52:48.003 --> 00:52:49.704
My gosh.

783
00:53:01.653 --> 00:53:04.124
My gosh. It hurts.

784
00:53:06.724 --> 00:53:08.224
Are you okay? Where should I take you?

785
00:53:08.593 --> 00:53:10.794
Drop me off at any pharmacy.

786
00:53:12.633 --> 00:53:14.233
I don't think I should.

787
00:53:14.303 --> 00:53:15.764
I'll take you to the nearest hospital.

788
00:53:15.764 --> 00:53:18.274
No, I'm okay. I'm really...

789
00:53:25.044 --> 00:53:27.943
Please... Please slow down.

790
00:53:33.684 --> 00:53:35.053
My gosh, please let go!

791
00:53:35.053 --> 00:53:36.224
That hurts!

792
00:53:36.584 --> 00:53:37.994
Gosh, let go of my hair!

793
00:53:38.093 --> 00:53:39.294
My goodness.

794
00:53:39.454 --> 00:53:41.024
Wait! Just a second!

795
00:53:41.994 --> 00:53:44.494
Her water broke!

796
00:53:50.303 --> 00:53:51.633
I told you I'm fine.

797
00:53:53.033 --> 00:53:55.303
Gosh, okay. I'm sorry. I apologize.

798
00:53:55.303 --> 00:53:57.814
Isn't she about to give birth any minute?

799
00:53:57.814 --> 00:53:59.613
The doctor will be here soon.

800
00:54:01.213 --> 00:54:03.314
My gosh, please let me go!

801
00:54:04.653 --> 00:54:06.084
When did you start having contractions?

802
00:54:06.383 --> 00:54:07.983
Gosh, I can't believe this.

803
00:54:08.553 --> 00:54:09.724
- Let me check. - My gosh.

804
00:54:10.184 --> 00:54:11.624
No. No.

805
00:54:12.224 --> 00:54:13.794
Ma'am, you need to cooperate.

806
00:54:13.863 --> 00:54:15.323
No. Don't.

807
00:54:15.823 --> 00:54:17.834
- My gosh, it hurts. - My goodness.

808
00:54:22.403 --> 00:54:23.834
Gosh, it hurts so much.

809
00:54:24.073 --> 00:54:26.633
Is she going to have the baby soon?

810
00:54:30.374 --> 00:54:31.843
Get an ultrasound scanner ready.

811
00:54:32.573 --> 00:54:33.914
"An ultrasound"? Why?

812
00:54:34.283 --> 00:54:35.584
May I talk to her guardian?

813
00:54:35.783 --> 00:54:37.144
"Guardian"? I'm not her guardian.

814
00:54:39.983 --> 00:54:41.954
I need to talk to you about...

815
00:54:42.823 --> 00:54:43.854
Ms. Jang!

816
00:54:44.494 --> 00:54:45.854
Where are you going?

817
00:55:11.113 --> 00:55:12.184
Ms. Jang!

818
00:55:22.923 --> 00:55:24.164
Ms. Jang.

819
00:55:25.394 --> 00:55:26.863
Ms. Jang, are you okay?

820
00:55:35.744 --> 00:55:37.104
- Check her blood pressure. - Okay.

821
00:55:46.283 --> 00:55:48.483
Gosh, what's on your face?

822
00:55:48.553 --> 00:55:50.593
Why aren't there any burp cloths?

823
00:55:55.064 --> 00:55:56.124
There's one.

824
00:56:01.334 --> 00:56:04.503
Do Ah, I'll be right back. Wait right here.

825
00:56:04.803 --> 00:56:05.974
I won't take long.

826
00:56:11.343 --> 00:56:13.343
- What? - It looks like...

827
00:56:13.343 --> 00:56:14.883
you have endometriosis.

828
00:56:15.744 --> 00:56:18.954
If you take a look, these big bumps...

829
00:56:18.954 --> 00:56:21.524
are signs of endometriosis.

830
00:56:21.524 --> 00:56:23.184
And that's what caused the severe pain.

831
00:56:23.584 --> 00:56:25.294
Why did you just endure the pain?

832
00:56:26.193 --> 00:56:27.894
Is it something really bad?

833
00:56:28.124 --> 00:56:30.193
No, you'll be fine once you get surgery.

834
00:56:31.264 --> 00:56:34.463
You also took the AMH test so you could freeze your eggs.

835
00:56:35.164 --> 00:56:37.104
The test says your ovaries...

836
00:56:37.874 --> 00:56:39.204
are 40 years old.

837
00:56:40.303 --> 00:56:42.204
To be honest, once you're past 35,

838
00:56:42.204 --> 00:56:43.874
your ovaries aren't in the best condition.

839
00:56:44.274 --> 00:56:46.814
So I honestly don't recommend you to freeze your eggs.

840
00:56:47.383 --> 00:56:50.314
You should've done it in your 20s or in your early 30s.

841
00:56:50.814 --> 00:56:52.854
But you're 39, and it's too late.

842
00:56:55.253 --> 00:56:56.684
So is it impossible?

843
00:56:58.253 --> 00:57:00.994
In your case, it's going to be hard...

844
00:57:00.994 --> 00:57:03.323
to collect an egg that's healthy and is in its best condition.

845
00:57:03.994 --> 00:57:05.894
Even if we manage to freeze it,

846
00:57:05.894 --> 00:57:08.834
the egg could get damaged when it defrosts...

847
00:57:08.834 --> 00:57:10.403
and gets fertilized.

848
00:57:12.733 --> 00:57:14.303
Is there no way?

849
00:57:14.874 --> 00:57:17.274
The chance for you to get naturally get pregnant...

850
00:57:18.744 --> 00:57:20.244
is below seven percent.

851
00:57:21.613 --> 00:57:25.113
Once you reach your 40s, it goes down to five percent.

852
00:57:25.383 --> 00:57:27.854
And once you're over 43 years old, the success rate for IVF...

853
00:57:28.024 --> 00:57:30.053
drops low to less than 10 percent.

854
00:57:30.423 --> 00:57:31.823
There's a 90 percent chance...

855
00:57:31.823 --> 00:57:33.693
that you could have a miscarriage before you're 10 weeks pregnant.

856
00:57:38.664 --> 00:57:41.503
Does that mean I won't ever be able to have a baby?

857
00:57:42.533 --> 00:57:43.664
Is it impossible for me?

858
00:57:46.774 --> 00:57:48.644
It's already hard for you to get pregnant.

859
00:57:49.073 --> 00:57:51.814
But if you get an endometriosis surgery,

860
00:57:51.814 --> 00:57:54.483
you can't get pregnant for a year since you'll be taking drugs.

861
00:57:54.883 --> 00:57:58.414
You lose eggs every month, so what will happen after a year?

862
00:57:59.283 --> 00:58:00.983
Your chance of getting pregnant will get even lower.

863
00:58:13.934 --> 00:58:15.033
The pharmacy.

864
00:58:16.503 --> 00:58:18.274
I need to go to the pharmacy.

865
00:58:22.843 --> 00:58:24.414
- Hello? - Where are you?

866
00:58:24.414 --> 00:58:25.414
Why aren't you back yet?

867
00:58:26.073 --> 00:58:27.314
I'm...

868
00:58:33.213 --> 00:58:34.283
I don't know where I am.

869
00:58:50.503 --> 00:58:52.974
I'm sure she brought some clothes from work.

870
00:58:58.673 --> 00:59:01.744
Here... It should be here.

871
00:59:07.954 --> 00:59:12.323
(Shoes that will take my baby to only the best places)

872
00:59:15.823 --> 00:59:21.164
(A baby bottle that will help my baby grow tall)

873
00:59:58.704 --> 01:00:03.774
(Write down what you want to be when you grow up.)

874
01:00:06.314 --> 01:00:07.914
Enjoy your food.

875
01:00:07.914 --> 01:00:09.544
- Okay. - Okay.

876
01:00:11.914 --> 01:00:14.883
You can be rich and extremely smart,

877
01:00:16.224 --> 01:00:18.153
but no one can ever beat someone who's happy.

878
01:00:18.553 --> 01:00:21.164
That's because being happy is the hardest thing in the world.

879
01:00:21.494 --> 01:00:24.664
But I hope you'll be able to achieve that, Ha Ri.

880
01:00:27.903 --> 01:00:33.434
(Mom)

881
01:00:35.003 --> 01:00:36.044
"Mom"?

882
01:00:37.003 --> 01:00:39.414
You're the happiest person in the world.

883
01:00:39.613 --> 01:00:41.414
You always smile every time you see a baby.

884
01:00:41.613 --> 01:00:44.184
Every kid likes their mom.

885
01:00:44.584 --> 01:00:47.253
My dream is to become a mom.

886
01:00:48.454 --> 01:00:50.854
(Mom)

887
01:01:08.903 --> 01:01:11.744
Ms. Jang, what are you doing here?

888
01:01:13.343 --> 01:01:15.943
I'm... I'm looking for a pharmacy.

889
01:01:26.653 --> 01:01:28.994
This can't be the end.

890
01:01:31.693 --> 01:01:33.593
But why does it feel like it's all over?

891
01:01:40.874 --> 01:01:42.073
No, it can't be.

892
01:01:47.073 --> 01:01:48.483
Do you want to marry me?

893
01:02:30.954 --> 01:02:33.954
(Oh My Baby)

894
01:02:33.954 --> 01:02:36.093
I'm about to turn 40.

895
01:02:36.093 --> 01:02:38.764
And I learned that it takes effort to date and get married.

896
01:02:38.764 --> 01:02:41.834
Jae Young, try to spend some time with her.

897
01:02:42.003 --> 01:02:44.503
Then you guys might grow feelings for each other.

898
01:02:45.003 --> 01:02:47.604
- Hey! - I don't think this will work.

899
01:02:47.774 --> 01:02:48.943
That's just our fate.

900
01:02:48.943 --> 01:02:51.814
Should I set you up with someone in return for the gift?

901
01:02:51.814 --> 01:02:55.283
We're all destined to meet someone. Don't search too far away.

902
01:02:55.343 --> 01:02:57.544
- Find someone nearby. - Ha Ri!

903
01:02:57.753 --> 01:03:01.483
You told me I'll fall for you.
