1
00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:50.785
Leave the room if you're dressed.

2
00:00:52.824 --> 00:00:56.024
Gosh, will you please go? I'm really embarrassed right now.

3
00:00:57.394 --> 00:00:58.464
No.

4
00:00:58.894 --> 00:01:02.065
Why would I leave? This is a chance for me to do whatever I want.

5
00:01:02.565 --> 00:01:03.705
What are you going to do?

6
00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:07.535
Is there something you want?

7
00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:10.345
Please. The day just started.

8
00:01:13.474 --> 00:01:15.944
What do you think I'm going to do?

9
00:01:19.214 --> 00:01:22.055
Something that will get you slapped or something nice?

10
00:01:28.324 --> 00:01:29.394
Ta-da.

11
00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:50.315
It looks pretty on you.

12
00:01:53.754 --> 00:01:54.815
Gosh.

13
00:01:56.785 --> 00:01:57.854
Thank you.

14
00:01:58.524 --> 00:01:59.595
Right.

15
00:01:59.694 --> 00:02:01.925
- Now, please leave. - Sure, get some rest.

16
00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:22.815
Right, here you go.

17
00:02:22.815 --> 00:02:24.414
Have it all.

18
00:02:24.715 --> 00:02:27.384
How can one eat all of this?

19
00:02:27.485 --> 00:02:28.685
Finish that and have seconds.

20
00:02:29.084 --> 00:02:31.524
I don't want the wind to whisk you away.

21
00:02:33.354 --> 00:02:34.825
Why are we sitting side by side though?

22
00:02:36.894 --> 00:02:39.394
Because this is more comfortable.

23
00:02:39.864 --> 00:02:41.565
Wait, are you blushing?

24
00:02:42.535 --> 00:02:43.565
Look at me for a second.

25
00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:46.604
Come on. Look this way.

26
00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:48.875
You've got it wrong.

27
00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:52.115
I'm refusing to look at you so that you won't be distracted...

28
00:02:52.715 --> 00:02:54.275
by my good looks.

29
00:02:54.914 --> 00:02:56.014
Hold on.

30
00:02:57.414 --> 00:02:59.254
Are you the one blushing now?

31
00:02:59.954 --> 00:03:01.085
Come on. Look this way.

32
00:03:01.185 --> 00:03:02.854
- Look at me. - Look ahead, will you?

33
00:03:02.854 --> 00:03:05.824
Let's have our breakfast while enjoying the scenery.

34
00:03:08.424 --> 00:03:10.264
Is this how it feels...

35
00:03:10.264 --> 00:03:11.764
to look in the same direction as the one you love?

36
00:03:13.095 --> 00:03:15.764
We'll look at each other from the front, the side,

37
00:03:15.764 --> 00:03:16.935
the back,

38
00:03:16.935 --> 00:03:18.674
and every single angle there is.

39
00:03:20.074 --> 00:03:21.134
Sounds perfect.

40
00:03:21.704 --> 00:03:22.905
Anyway, let's enjoy.

41
00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:24.944
I will, but it really is a lot.

42
00:04:06.254 --> 00:04:07.285
Mom.

43
00:04:13.924 --> 00:04:14.995
Isn't mom home?

44
00:05:03.304 --> 00:05:06.114
Last night, I...

45
00:05:24.765 --> 00:05:25.864
Do Ah.

46
00:05:26.765 --> 00:05:27.835
I'm here.

47
00:05:30.835 --> 00:05:31.905
Don't cry.

48
00:05:34.874 --> 00:05:36.974
- Good job, everyone. - Let's grab a bite.

49
00:05:36.974 --> 00:05:38.275
It's my treat.

50
00:05:38.275 --> 00:05:40.114
- Don't be late tomorrow. - See you tomorrow.

51
00:05:45.515 --> 00:05:47.114
It's 10,000 dollars. Take it.

52
00:05:48.455 --> 00:05:50.785
I only asked for 5,000 dollars,

53
00:05:51.325 --> 00:05:52.554
but you give me double?

54
00:05:52.655 --> 00:05:53.755
You don't need to pay me back.

55
00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:57.265
Take it and don't ever contact Ok Hee again. Got it?

56
00:05:58.224 --> 00:05:59.294
Unbelievable.

57
00:05:59.765 --> 00:06:01.494
I never said I wouldn't pay it back.

58
00:06:01.494 --> 00:06:04.505
Tae Seob, you're not someone I wish to be conversing with.

59
00:06:04.505 --> 00:06:06.174
Even the devil wouldn't be this shameless.

60
00:06:06.174 --> 00:06:07.535
How can you ask her for money?

61
00:06:08.905 --> 00:06:10.845
Asking her isn't an ideal situation for me either.

62
00:06:12.445 --> 00:06:14.645
I don't care if you're completely broke.

63
00:06:14.914 --> 00:06:16.544
Don't ever show yourself to Ok Hee nor me.

64
00:06:16.544 --> 00:06:18.215
You make me sick.

65
00:06:18.215 --> 00:06:20.684
What did I do to make you this hostile toward me?

66
00:06:20.684 --> 00:06:22.955
How can you say that after everything you put me through?

67
00:06:22.955 --> 00:06:24.684
But you're doing well now.

68
00:06:26.395 --> 00:06:28.354
You just don't get it, do you?

69
00:06:30.965 --> 00:06:32.395
How's Ha Ri?

70
00:06:34.095 --> 00:06:35.234
Why would you ask about her?

71
00:06:35.335 --> 00:06:37.664
Because she's my daughter and I miss her.

72
00:06:37.664 --> 00:06:38.804
She doesn't have a father.

73
00:06:39.205 --> 00:06:40.874
You're less than a stranger to her.

74
00:06:41.174 --> 00:06:43.075
Just because she's older doesn't mean it'll hurt less.

75
00:06:43.075 --> 00:06:44.405
If you think of her as your daughter,

76
00:06:44.405 --> 00:06:45.744
if you're decent even in the slightest,

77
00:06:46.075 --> 00:06:47.575
don't even think about calling her.

78
00:06:50.914 --> 00:06:52.085
But... Hey!

79
00:07:01.255 --> 00:07:03.164
(Contacts)

80
00:07:06.364 --> 00:07:07.465
Are you home?

81
00:07:08.234 --> 00:07:09.535
Is it okay to go home?

82
00:07:11.765 --> 00:07:13.335
Why would you call before coming home?

83
00:07:14.135 --> 00:07:16.744
Who knows what you'd be doing with your boyfriend?

84
00:07:17.945 --> 00:07:20.414
Isn't that why I have the second floor all to myself?

85
00:07:20.414 --> 00:07:21.914
Just don't let me catch you.

86
00:07:21.914 --> 00:07:25.614
I promise I'll do my best to let you have your privacy.

87
00:07:29.885 --> 00:07:31.054
You bought another batch?

88
00:07:31.525 --> 00:07:33.255
I can brew that for myself, you know.

89
00:07:33.255 --> 00:07:34.854
As if you have the time.

90
00:07:34.854 --> 00:07:36.494
Don't be silly and just drink what I brew.

91
00:07:36.864 --> 00:07:37.924
The kettle, please.

92
00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.974
You can't wait while your condition worsens.

93
00:07:46.635 --> 00:07:49.075
I guess you need to speed up your wedding.

94
00:07:52.215 --> 00:07:53.275
Han I Sang.

95
00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:55.345
Must it be him?

96
00:07:55.345 --> 00:07:56.945
Is he the only one you have eyes for?

97
00:07:58.345 --> 00:08:00.785
There's no room in my heart left for another.

98
00:08:02.385 --> 00:08:04.724
You never consider the consequences of a heartache...

99
00:08:04.724 --> 00:08:06.994
and give your heart out to the one you love.

100
00:08:07.755 --> 00:08:11.064
Why can't you be more sly and selfish for a change?

101
00:08:12.064 --> 00:08:13.164
Mom,

102
00:08:14.064 --> 00:08:16.434
don't you approve of I Sang?

103
00:08:17.064 --> 00:08:20.374
It's you, actually. I don't like the softy you become.

104
00:08:22.244 --> 00:08:24.505
Be a wife cherished by her husband...

105
00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:25.945
and don't have a marriage like mine.

106
00:08:39.554 --> 00:08:45.064
(Episode 13: Why Life Brings Us Hardships)

107
00:09:39.385 --> 00:09:40.755
You're early today.

108
00:09:40.954 --> 00:09:42.554
No, you're the one who's early.

109
00:09:42.554 --> 00:09:43.924
This is when I always arrive.

110
00:09:44.155 --> 00:09:45.385
Anyway, what's the occasion?

111
00:09:45.525 --> 00:09:47.025
I must've wanted to come to work badly...

112
00:09:47.025 --> 00:09:48.655
because I woke up way before I usually do.

113
00:09:53.735 --> 00:09:56.035
Ms. Jang, good morning.

114
00:09:56.035 --> 00:09:57.434
Good morning. Just a second.

115
00:10:01.775 --> 00:10:02.875
Well,

116
00:10:04.775 --> 00:10:05.944
this is for you.

117
00:10:09.115 --> 00:10:12.355
I've been meaning to give it to you, but I never got the chance.

118
00:10:12.485 --> 00:10:13.584
It's pomegranate juice.

119
00:10:14.314 --> 00:10:15.954
Are you looking out for my health?

120
00:10:16.554 --> 00:10:18.255
Thanks. Let's go then.

121
00:10:19.954 --> 00:10:21.194
Just a second.

122
00:10:21.194 --> 00:10:23.365
I have something to say to Eu Ddeum.

123
00:10:23.564 --> 00:10:26.235
- We'll be right up. - Sure.

124
00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:29.235
I'll see you up there.

125
00:10:36.174 --> 00:10:37.444
Why do you like Ms. Jang?

126
00:10:37.905 --> 00:10:40.515
Is being with an older woman a fantasy of yours?

127
00:10:42.174 --> 00:10:43.414
Aren't I prettier?

128
00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:47.054
No, Ms. Jang is prettier.

129
00:10:49.525 --> 00:10:52.355
I can't believe you're still hung up on her.

130
00:10:52.554 --> 00:10:54.324
Just stop whatever it is you feel for her...

131
00:10:54.324 --> 00:10:55.725
so that you can move on.

132
00:10:58.794 --> 00:11:00.194
I let the emotions go gently.

133
00:11:01.594 --> 00:11:03.204
I've never felt this way for someone before...

134
00:11:05.135 --> 00:11:06.375
and I didn't want it to be a bad memory.

135
00:11:07.074 --> 00:11:09.275
How can a one-sided love end beautifully?

136
00:11:12.615 --> 00:11:14.314
My feelings for her were pure...

137
00:11:15.344 --> 00:11:18.645
and were still genuine even though they weren't reciprocated.

138
00:11:21.985 --> 00:11:23.225
So how can it not be a good memory?

139
00:11:27.054 --> 00:11:28.125
Have a good day then.

140
00:11:32.635 --> 00:11:33.765
I want...

141
00:11:35.964 --> 00:11:37.505
this man.

142
00:11:48.214 --> 00:11:50.285
- Hi. - Hey. Good morning.

143
00:11:50.285 --> 00:11:52.684
- Hi, hi. - You're here early.

144
00:11:52.954 --> 00:11:55.155
I'm in a really good mood.

145
00:12:38.025 --> 00:12:39.865
Okay, nice.

146
00:12:40.495 --> 00:12:41.735
Okay, nice.

147
00:12:42.035 --> 00:12:44.865
We're done. You may go change now.

148
00:13:00.314 --> 00:13:03.355
Are you shocked that I'm good at taking wedding pictures too?

149
00:13:03.985 --> 00:13:06.495
This is how broad my range is.

150
00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:09.294
Should I take one too?

151
00:13:12.735 --> 00:13:13.895
Are you getting married?

152
00:13:15.064 --> 00:13:17.235
I want to. And I should.

153
00:13:19.905 --> 00:13:23.905
You'll have a wife nagging you then.

154
00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:26.645
That'll be sweet.

155
00:13:29.444 --> 00:13:33.115
You'll struggle to pay for your kid's tuition.

156
00:13:34.985 --> 00:13:37.355
I've always wanted to emulate your sense of responsibility.

157
00:13:38.285 --> 00:13:39.725
Thank you.

158
00:13:40.324 --> 00:13:43.725
You'll never be able to do something you've never done before anymore.

159
00:13:45.525 --> 00:13:46.865
I'll do it with her.

160
00:13:47.334 --> 00:13:50.064
Do you think Ha Ri won't do it with me?

161
00:13:52.934 --> 00:13:54.434
See once you're married.

162
00:13:54.434 --> 00:13:56.804
It won't be the life that you've dreamt of.

163
00:13:57.544 --> 00:13:59.645
I grumble about how tough it is,

164
00:13:59.844 --> 00:14:01.714
but it's not super exhausting.

165
00:14:02.985 --> 00:14:04.314
It's okay if marriage is exhausting.

166
00:14:05.684 --> 00:14:08.714
I love Ha Ri very selfishly and shamelessly,

167
00:14:09.824 --> 00:14:13.725
so I must make her happy no matter what.

168
00:14:36.115 --> 00:14:37.245
Hey, Jae Young.

169
00:14:37.745 --> 00:14:38.785
Auntie.

170
00:14:39.454 --> 00:14:41.554
- What brings you here? - Well,

171
00:14:41.554 --> 00:14:43.855
it's nice out. How about a date?

172
00:14:49.824 --> 00:14:53.535
I come to places like this all the time.

173
00:14:53.535 --> 00:14:56.265
I feel it every time, but it's needlessly expensive.

174
00:14:56.265 --> 00:14:58.865
Why are you wasting money like this?

175
00:14:59.875 --> 00:15:03.145
The conversation switched smoothly into nagging.

176
00:15:03.375 --> 00:15:06.145
"I took you in, fed you, gave you a place to live,"

177
00:15:06.145 --> 00:15:08.844
"did your laundry, and watched your baby."

178
00:15:08.844 --> 00:15:11.914
"But this is all you get me?" That's what you should be saying.

179
00:15:12.115 --> 00:15:14.954
You're buying me a nice meal. Why would I be picky?

180
00:15:16.025 --> 00:15:18.454
Can you take this long for a lunch break?

181
00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:20.355
Don't you have patients?

182
00:15:20.495 --> 00:15:22.025
I don't know if it's a blessing or a curse,

183
00:15:22.025 --> 00:15:24.164
but we keep getting more and more patients.

184
00:15:24.725 --> 00:15:27.765
I was going to make lots of money and buy you lots of good food.

185
00:15:28.735 --> 00:15:31.865
I'll visit often. Let's go on more dates.

186
00:15:34.505 --> 00:15:35.605
Are you moving out?

187
00:15:37.304 --> 00:15:38.405
I should.

188
00:15:39.245 --> 00:15:41.015
How can I face Ha Ri now?

189
00:15:42.245 --> 00:15:44.214
There's nothing more I can do either.

190
00:15:46.115 --> 00:15:47.314
Jae Young.

191
00:15:49.015 --> 00:15:51.285
You were too good to pass up on,

192
00:15:52.424 --> 00:15:56.265
so I wronged you out of my greed. I'm so sorry.

193
00:15:57.225 --> 00:15:58.525
No, Auntie.

194
00:15:58.525 --> 00:16:01.334
It was me. I got greedy for Ha Ri.

195
00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:05.005
Why didn't you and my mom make an oath...

196
00:16:05.005 --> 00:16:08.204
like everyone else to marry Ha Ri and me while we were...

197
00:16:08.204 --> 00:16:09.304
still in your bellies?

198
00:16:09.875 --> 00:16:12.775
Why didn't we do something everyone else did?

199
00:16:13.145 --> 00:16:15.814
We should've forced you into an arranged marriage at age 20.

200
00:16:15.814 --> 00:16:19.714
We would've hated each other, bickered, and grew on each other...

201
00:16:19.714 --> 00:16:23.125
You would've liked each other, but since it's an arranged marriage,

202
00:16:23.324 --> 00:16:25.424
you'd doubt each other's sincerity, break up...

203
00:16:25.424 --> 00:16:27.424
And confirm each other's love in dramatic fashion,

204
00:16:27.424 --> 00:16:29.664
and get married for love.

205
00:16:29.995 --> 00:16:33.694
It's such an old and cliche story...

206
00:16:34.964 --> 00:16:37.535
It sounds lame now that I said it out loud.

207
00:16:38.735 --> 00:16:40.605
I agree. It's lame.

208
00:16:43.245 --> 00:16:45.544
- Eat up. - Okay.

209
00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:02.765
Is it that sad that he's taking vitamins?

210
00:17:03.294 --> 00:17:06.395
You know. He's taking them for his treatment.

211
00:17:09.164 --> 00:17:12.365
He's doing it because he wants to. It's nothing to be sad about.

212
00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:15.275
Are you wishing us luck? How nice of you.

213
00:17:15.275 --> 00:17:17.875
I was on your side from the get-go.

214
00:17:21.414 --> 00:17:23.944
Tae Rin, shall we put this on?

215
00:17:25.985 --> 00:17:27.184
Mommy.

216
00:17:34.725 --> 00:17:36.025
Did you think I was mommy?

217
00:17:36.525 --> 00:17:39.165
Where's mommy? Let's go look for her.

218
00:17:39.165 --> 00:17:40.265
Where could she be?

219
00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:42.535
- There's mommy. - Tae Rin.

220
00:17:43.364 --> 00:17:46.535
Should we change? Do you want to pick?

221
00:17:46.705 --> 00:17:47.834
How about this?

222
00:17:48.505 --> 00:17:49.574
Let's take a look.

223
00:17:50.205 --> 00:17:52.275
How pretty. Do you want to put this on?

224
00:17:52.705 --> 00:17:53.715
Let's go.

225
00:18:01.755 --> 00:18:03.354
- My ID. - What?

226
00:18:03.624 --> 00:18:06.324
- Turn back. - Didn't you leave it at the office?

227
00:18:06.425 --> 00:18:08.294
Seriously.

228
00:18:08.354 --> 00:18:10.665
Get going. Go.

229
00:18:11.624 --> 00:18:13.894
Shouldn't you get a ring first?

230
00:18:14.495 --> 00:18:16.165
I don't know her ring size.

231
00:18:16.665 --> 00:18:18.205
How can I get her size without her knowing?

232
00:18:18.205 --> 00:18:20.005
Hey. That's a mission...

233
00:18:20.005 --> 00:18:22.574
that is worthy of "Mission Impossible".

234
00:18:22.874 --> 00:18:26.005
She'll figure it out even if you just look at her finger.

235
00:18:26.074 --> 00:18:27.915
Where are you going to propose to her?

236
00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:29.985
How about a cathedral?

237
00:18:30.384 --> 00:18:32.715
It seems reverent and trustworthy.

238
00:18:32.715 --> 00:18:36.525
And Ha Ri has a Mother Theresa image.

239
00:18:37.285 --> 00:18:39.285
I never knew that.

240
00:18:39.384 --> 00:18:43.064
Why don't you just propose and get married at a cathedral?

241
00:18:43.725 --> 00:18:45.265
- That sounds good. - Wrong answer.

242
00:18:45.364 --> 00:18:47.364
That's not right.

243
00:18:47.435 --> 00:18:50.104
That would be a problem if Ha Ri is a Buddhist.

244
00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:53.804
Come to think of it, I don't even know her religion.

245
00:18:54.205 --> 00:18:56.245
Where would be good?

246
00:18:56.445 --> 00:18:57.775
It's complicated.

247
00:18:58.574 --> 00:19:00.044
As much as an equation of higher degree.

248
00:19:04.844 --> 00:19:06.584
Oh my gosh!

249
00:19:06.584 --> 00:19:08.015
My gosh!

250
00:19:08.015 --> 00:19:10.154
- He's going to propose! - I know!

251
00:19:10.154 --> 00:19:12.554
- I'd be so happy if I were her. - I know.

252
00:19:12.554 --> 00:19:15.425
But is Ms. Jang disappointed because she found out?

253
00:19:15.755 --> 00:19:18.195
Now that she knows, she can prepare herself.

254
00:19:19.195 --> 00:19:21.834
- Marry me. - Will you marry me?

255
00:19:21.935 --> 00:19:23.965
- Will you marry me? - Will you marry me?

256
00:19:25.005 --> 00:19:27.005
- Oh my gosh. - I wish I could see.

257
00:19:27.535 --> 00:19:28.735
She needs a dress.

258
00:19:28.735 --> 00:19:29.904
Let's hurry.

259
00:19:29.904 --> 00:19:31.404
- Come on. - Let's go.

260
00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:34.775
- I'm so excited. - I know, right?

261
00:19:43.455 --> 00:19:45.455
He's going to propose to me.

262
00:19:47.154 --> 00:19:48.525
My goodness gracious.

263
00:19:50.765 --> 00:19:52.064
What should I do?

264
00:19:53.064 --> 00:19:54.064
My gosh.

265
00:19:57.265 --> 00:19:58.265
Oh my gosh.

266
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:12.301
No. He wouldn't do it today.

267
00:20:13.831 --> 00:20:16.271
He won't pop his trunk...

268
00:20:16.271 --> 00:20:18.101
and have balloons float out...

269
00:20:18.101 --> 00:20:20.611
and a million roses inside, right?

270
00:20:21.541 --> 00:20:25.041
No way. Not in front of my coworkers.

271
00:20:25.781 --> 00:20:26.881
Just a minute.

272
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.480
Why? Where are you going?

273
00:20:29.081 --> 00:20:31.851
Why are you popping the trunk? Don't do it!

274
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.420
Why are you doing that in front of the office?

275
00:20:39.321 --> 00:20:43.200
What? It... It won't take long.

276
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.831
I'm almost done.

277
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.831
You can wait in the car.

278
00:20:50.101 --> 00:20:51.170
Well...

279
00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.710
I just didn't want the place to be dusty.

280
00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:59.141
You really do love your workplace.

281
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:00.781
Get in the car.

282
00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:14.531
He's not going to propose all of a sudden in the car, right?

283
00:21:17.831 --> 00:21:18.930
What am I supposed to say?

284
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:21.531
"Yes!"

285
00:21:22.331 --> 00:21:23.871
That sounds like I scored a goal or something.

286
00:21:25.071 --> 00:21:26.141
"Thank you"?

287
00:21:26.771 --> 00:21:28.210
Gosh, no.

288
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.940
"Sure, let's do that"? "Sounds great"?

289
00:21:35.081 --> 00:21:36.420
Open the glove compartment.

290
00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.680
- No. - What?

291
00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.781
What?

292
00:21:39.621 --> 00:21:41.720
- Open... - No.

293
00:21:43.591 --> 00:21:45.521
I'm not ready for it yet.

294
00:21:51.801 --> 00:21:53.871
- You can drop me off over there. - What?

295
00:21:55.101 --> 00:21:57.341
Why? Aren't we going to eat together?

296
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.210
I made a reservation at a nice restaurant.

297
00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.841
I'm guessing that place has a grand piano...

298
00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.381
and just so happens to be empty today.

299
00:22:09.381 --> 00:22:10.851
Am I correct?

300
00:22:15.091 --> 00:22:17.521
How did you know?

301
00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:19.121
I made a reservation at a one-table restaurant.

302
00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:23.700
But I don't think there's a grand piano there.

303
00:22:24.361 --> 00:22:27.071
From what I remember, it was an old, brown piano.

304
00:22:27.331 --> 00:22:28.430
I'll get off over there.

305
00:22:29.571 --> 00:22:31.341
I forgot I had other plans.

306
00:22:31.871 --> 00:22:33.440
Let's go there next time.

307
00:22:39.851 --> 00:22:41.210
I'm sorry for leaving like this.

308
00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:43.720
I'll think about how I feel.

309
00:22:43.881 --> 00:22:46.990
So you should also reconsider and see if this is...

310
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.791
what you really want.

311
00:23:02.831 --> 00:23:05.541
Does she not like flowers, or does she not like the restaurant?

312
00:23:07.641 --> 00:23:09.341
What did I do wrong?

313
00:23:11.311 --> 00:23:12.440
You got cold feet.

314
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.010
What's that?

315
00:23:15.311 --> 00:23:17.351
A kind of fear you have before you get married.

316
00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.291
Your life changes when you get married.

317
00:23:20.521 --> 00:23:22.851
So deep down in your heart, you're telling yourself to run away.

318
00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.690
Why would I run away?

319
00:23:25.821 --> 00:23:27.490
I know I had once given up,

320
00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:28.690
but I've dreamt of getting married for 39 years.

321
00:23:30.801 --> 00:23:35.331
A dream is an imagination of what you want the most.

322
00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:37.801
But reality is different.

323
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.541
You dream of utopia, so you cross the Pacific,

324
00:23:41.771 --> 00:23:43.710
and walk your way through the desert,

325
00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.381
but you arrive at an empty plain.

326
00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:49.510
You're just scared that's how it might feel.

327
00:23:52.021 --> 00:23:53.121
Well...

328
00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.061
I just dreamt of having a normal family.

329
00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:00.591
I just want to raise my kids with my husband...

330
00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:02.391
and have a happy family.

331
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:04.301
Just like everyone else.

332
00:24:06.061 --> 00:24:09.200
Hey, living like everyone else...

333
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.571
is the hardest thing ever.

334
00:24:12.601 --> 00:24:15.771
Maybe you want a normal and happy family...

335
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:19.680
because you've never had that.

336
00:24:21.611 --> 00:24:23.920
What? You mean my dad?

337
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:27.420
I guess that might be the reason.

338
00:24:29.051 --> 00:24:31.521
But I'm not just left with bad memories of my dad.

339
00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.631
He adored me.

340
00:24:38.831 --> 00:24:41.200
He taught me how to ride a bike.

341
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.700
He also took me to a valley every summer...

342
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:46.101
and taught me how to swim.

343
00:24:48.111 --> 00:24:50.081
He also bought me snacks when my mom wasn't around.

344
00:24:56.521 --> 00:24:57.750
Then he just left.

345
00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.490
I don't think I Sang will leave because he's such a stable guy.

346
00:25:06.791 --> 00:25:09.331
But why can't I just enjoy this excitement I'm feeling?

347
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:12.660
Why do I keep running away?

348
00:25:15.871 --> 00:25:17.841
Hey, maybe you're scared...

349
00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.071
that he might propose in a really weird way.

350
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.281
Right? That must be why, right?

351
00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.650
But if you do end up getting cold feet,

352
00:25:28.881 --> 00:25:30.150
it won't hurt to reconsider.

353
00:25:30.321 --> 00:25:31.851
It'll be your last chance to think clearly...

354
00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.891
while you're so full of love and passion.

355
00:25:40.061 --> 00:25:41.160
Thanks.

356
00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.131
You're pretty smart.

357
00:25:45.131 --> 00:25:46.900
(Announcement: Blackout warning)

358
00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:47.930
Jae Young.

359
00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:53.811
Jae Young.

360
00:25:54.771 --> 00:25:56.641
Are you upset because I didn't go apartment hunting with you?

361
00:25:58.141 --> 00:26:00.010
Should I go with you this weekend?

362
00:26:02.081 --> 00:26:04.321
Jae Young. Buddy.

363
00:26:05.351 --> 00:26:06.891
Will you stop being angry at me?

364
00:26:07.121 --> 00:26:08.551
Something's on my mind.

365
00:26:09.091 --> 00:26:11.260
It's your job to eat tripe with me and hear me out.

366
00:26:11.791 --> 00:26:13.230
And I'll do the same.

367
00:26:14.331 --> 00:26:15.391
Come on, buddy.

368
00:26:20.631 --> 00:26:22.700
I get what you mean, so stop it.

369
00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:25.170
I know you need a friend.

370
00:26:31.881 --> 00:26:34.750
But I don't think I can be your friend right now.

371
00:26:50.861 --> 00:26:52.631
If you really cared about me,

372
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.271
you should've told me that he came.

373
00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:57.700
Gosh, I won't kick you out of the building.

374
00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.240
So don't ever meet him again.

375
00:27:01.341 --> 00:27:03.071
Why did he ask for Ha Ri's number?

376
00:27:03.071 --> 00:27:04.410
You'd better not tell him.

377
00:27:06.041 --> 00:27:07.611
He wants to meet Ha Ri?

378
00:27:17.621 --> 00:27:19.930
We have an interview later with an infertile couple, right?

379
00:27:20.131 --> 00:27:21.131
Yes.

380
00:27:22.091 --> 00:27:23.760
Ji Hye is showing signs of miscarriage,

381
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.000
so it's only going to be the husband.

382
00:27:26.361 --> 00:27:27.871
Is it bad?

383
00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.470
She'll be fine.

384
00:27:31.101 --> 00:27:32.200
She should be fine.

385
00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:36.611
Are you okay with interviewing with the infertile couple?

386
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.950
Why? Are you worried I might get scared and worry even more?

387
00:27:42.881 --> 00:27:45.220
I'm worried you might act like you're okay...

388
00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.521
when you're not.

389
00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.291
Ha Ri.

390
00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.000
Promise me one thing.

391
00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.940
Whenever you're having a hard time or hurting inside,

392
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:05.841
I want you to be honest with me about it.

393
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.641
That way, I'll be able to hug you.

394
00:28:08.341 --> 00:28:10.111
Why do you keep trying to hug me?

395
00:28:10.311 --> 00:28:12.940
Do you feel like hugging me every time you see me?

396
00:28:14.051 --> 00:28:17.150
What do you think of moving out and living inside my pocket?

397
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:19.781
You get cheekier every day.

398
00:28:21.621 --> 00:28:23.121
You should think about it.

399
00:28:23.291 --> 00:28:25.121
Don't you want to be together every single day?

400
00:28:28.861 --> 00:28:31.101
- Just a second. - "Every day"?

401
00:28:43.811 --> 00:28:44.881
You're going to do it here?

402
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.510
It's too bright, and there are people around.

403
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:48.611
No, wait.

404
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:50.920
Wait. Let me do this.

405
00:28:52.381 --> 00:28:53.490
Just a second.

406
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:57.960
What? Where am I supposed to tie my shoelaces?

407
00:28:58.361 --> 00:29:01.091
Ha Ri, I won't do it when other people are around.

408
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:03.031
Why would you do that out in the street?

409
00:29:03.561 --> 00:29:05.730
Then where else am I supposed to do it?

410
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:07.500
Don't ask me. This is wrong.

411
00:29:08.031 --> 00:29:12.500
What? Is it that embarrassing to tie shoelaces out in the street?

412
00:29:13.571 --> 00:29:16.641
My gosh, she's a fussy one.

413
00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.150
My gosh.

414
00:29:25.051 --> 00:29:27.321
What's the matter with you?

415
00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.361
My gosh, that's unbelievable.

416
00:29:33.361 --> 00:29:34.730
It's crazy.

417
00:29:40.331 --> 00:29:42.230
Ha Ri's ring size is 11.

418
00:29:42.371 --> 00:29:44.601
She doesn't have a religion. Don't get married at a cathedral.

419
00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.700
Here. Take this.

420
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:48.041
We're done here. Let's go.

421
00:29:56.581 --> 00:29:58.081
I can give you advice for your proposal.

422
00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.551
You can ask me questions for an event.

423
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.990
But do not call me after work.

424
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:34.690
- Eu Ddeum. - Yes?

425
00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:37.160
- Can you go over this with me? - Sure.

426
00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.861
- Hello. - Hi.

427
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:16.460
Can I perhaps ask you something?

428
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:17.861
Sure, go ahead.

429
00:31:17.930 --> 00:31:21.331
You're not the chairman's grandson, right?

430
00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.101
Maybe you're hiding your identity...

431
00:31:24.101 --> 00:31:26.910
and trying to learn the ropes from the lowest position.

432
00:31:28.541 --> 00:31:30.841
Of course not. I told you the other day...

433
00:31:30.881 --> 00:31:32.841
about what my parents do for a living.

434
00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.051
Your parents seem amazing and all,

435
00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.450
but that could also be part of your cover story.

436
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.690
Anyway, I guess I got it wrong.

437
00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:50.260
What's going on?

438
00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.170
Just know that it wasn't easy for me...

439
00:31:55.071 --> 00:31:57.041
to give up on my dream.

440
00:32:00.541 --> 00:32:03.980
Now, we should have dinner together tonight.

441
00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.351
If this is to repay me for the incident at the police station,

442
00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.220
you don't have to.

443
00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.591
I'll buy dinner,

444
00:32:19.591 --> 00:32:22.930
so you buy me dessert.

445
00:32:25.061 --> 00:32:26.200
Come on.

446
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.000
Just hold on a second.

447
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.071
Is this how it's going to be?

448
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.641
Are you booking a restaurant?

449
00:32:35.111 --> 00:32:36.341
Just a second.

450
00:32:37.041 --> 00:32:38.141
Okay.

451
00:32:39.111 --> 00:32:41.450
(You have received a gift.)

452
00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:45.450
I wonder which restaurant you chose.

453
00:32:46.051 --> 00:32:48.821
(Choi Kang Eu Ddeum sent an Americano dessert set.)

454
00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:53.260
I sent you a dessert voucher,

455
00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:56.930
so there's no need to buy me dinner.

456
00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.430
Have a good day then.

457
00:32:59.061 --> 00:33:01.730
Have a good day.

458
00:33:03.771 --> 00:33:04.871
Seriously?

459
00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:17.821
What's your religion?

460
00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:19.980
I'm Catholic.

461
00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:22.591
Oh, so you go to church.

462
00:33:23.521 --> 00:33:26.160
Do you do this?

463
00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:30.031
I've been trying to attend a church service too,

464
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:32.160
but it hasn't been easy.

465
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:35.470
All you have to do is go to Sunday Mass.

466
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:39.801
I'm saying that I'm completely clueless...

467
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.041
which is why I need some kind of guidance.

468
00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.981
Which church do you attend?

469
00:33:46.581 --> 00:33:48.311
Aren't you supposed to spread your beliefs?

470
00:33:48.651 --> 00:33:50.351
You should do so with me.

471
00:33:52.121 --> 00:33:53.621
That's not how we operate.

472
00:33:53.891 --> 00:33:56.151
Every district has its own parish,

473
00:33:56.251 --> 00:33:59.421
so look into that and attend the church in your neighborhood.

474
00:34:00.021 --> 00:34:01.260
Good day, then.

475
00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:06.300
What a slippery snake.

476
00:34:06.501 --> 00:34:08.671
I just can't seem to get a tight clasp around him.

477
00:34:08.970 --> 00:34:11.401
He slips away no matter how I come at him.

478
00:34:12.371 --> 00:34:13.570
Unbelievable.

479
00:34:26.521 --> 00:34:29.050
Do Ah, have a good time,

480
00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.391
and don't worry about me.

481
00:34:37.961 --> 00:34:40.530
She gets annoyed if she doesn't get a snack after her meal.

482
00:34:40.970 --> 00:34:43.430
She likes to enjoy rice crackers in each hand,

483
00:34:43.941 --> 00:34:45.401
so don't forget that.

484
00:34:46.101 --> 00:34:47.171
Got it.

485
00:34:47.211 --> 00:34:50.811
She can't sleep without her favorite stuffed animal,

486
00:34:51.211 --> 00:34:52.780
so make sure it's with her.

487
00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.510
All right. We'll get going then.

488
00:34:56.711 --> 00:34:58.021
Also, Do Ah...

489
00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:00.990
I'll call if I have any questions.

490
00:35:17.541 --> 00:35:18.601
Do Ah.

491
00:35:18.901 --> 00:35:21.771
Guess who this is. It's your dad, right?

492
00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:23.811
Don't you forget me.

493
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.910
I said I'll bring her back tomorrow.

494
00:35:40.691 --> 00:35:41.860
If only...

495
00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:45.630
you were like this back then.

496
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:48.300
Still,

497
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:51.240
I didn't abandon our daughter.

498
00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:53.910
For you though,

499
00:35:55.211 --> 00:35:57.211
your career mattered more than her.

500
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:13.860
Is Ji Hye doing all right?

501
00:36:14.291 --> 00:36:16.961
She spends most of her waking hours on her back.

502
00:36:17.401 --> 00:36:18.700
I'm sure she'll be all right.

503
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.831
I hope so.

504
00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:22.171
I'd be sad too if this doesn't work out,

505
00:36:22.901 --> 00:36:24.401
but she'll be devastated.

506
00:36:25.271 --> 00:36:26.941
She even quit her job years ago...

507
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:29.171
so that she could focus on getting pregnant.

508
00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:32.541
Every time it doesn't work out, she cries herself to sleep.

509
00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.481
How hard it is for me isn't even an issue.

510
00:36:37.421 --> 00:36:41.421
I want us to have a baby too, but this means the world to her.

511
00:36:42.151 --> 00:36:43.751
That's why I can't even talk her out of it now,

512
00:36:44.791 --> 00:36:46.360
but watching her is excruciating.

513
00:36:52.501 --> 00:36:55.671
Either way, you must feel guilty.

514
00:36:56.371 --> 00:36:57.541
Of course.

515
00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.740
All that I can do is pray at this point.

516
00:37:00.771 --> 00:37:02.840
I hope it's heard this time around.

517
00:37:03.271 --> 00:37:04.410
Of course.

518
00:37:16.191 --> 00:37:17.521
Don't ever...

519
00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.061
feel guilty, all right?

520
00:37:22.831 --> 00:37:26.231
You're pushing back the surgery even though it's recommended.

521
00:37:28.731 --> 00:37:30.840
Are you sure you're not in any pain?

522
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.010
So that's what you've been worrying about.

523
00:37:37.041 --> 00:37:39.141
If your time is almost up...

524
00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.751
and my test results show no improvement,

525
00:37:44.081 --> 00:37:45.621
only think about yourself.

526
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:48.590
Please do that.

527
00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:18.180
Mom?

528
00:38:21.421 --> 00:38:22.891
Why did you come here instead of going home?

529
00:38:23.291 --> 00:38:24.860
What are you doing here?

530
00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:26.720
To get some fresh air.

531
00:38:27.831 --> 00:38:30.191
Then I should enjoy it with you.

532
00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:38.771
Mom.

533
00:38:40.711 --> 00:38:42.641
What would your life had been like...

534
00:38:43.441 --> 00:38:45.240
if I hadn't come into the picture?

535
00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.550
I would've lived my life in some way.

536
00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.621
Instead of working hard to feed you,

537
00:38:53.621 --> 00:38:55.621
I would've done so to keep my mouth fed.

538
00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:00.421
When lonely, I would've found...

539
00:39:00.421 --> 00:39:01.691
a fun activity to enjoy.

540
00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:05.001
But then again, I wouldn't have known other things...

541
00:39:06.061 --> 00:39:08.030
such as the joy of raising a child.

542
00:39:08.831 --> 00:39:12.470
Having a kid to lean and depend on is also happiness.

543
00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:22.010
Are you worried that you'll never have kids?

544
00:39:27.921 --> 00:39:29.021
A little.

545
00:39:30.921 --> 00:39:32.291
What would I do...

546
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:35.660
if I marry...

547
00:39:36.191 --> 00:39:37.731
but remain childless...

548
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:41.470
and my husband leaves me for some reason?

549
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:43.601
Why would you even think that?

550
00:39:45.171 --> 00:39:46.501
Are you worried about following in my footsteps?

551
00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:49.811
No, of course not!

552
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.081
I'm just thinking of likely scenarios.

553
00:39:54.151 --> 00:39:56.811
Life doesn't always unfold the way we want it to.

554
00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:02.220
Only think about it being good. That's what makes the difference.

555
00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:04.791
If you end up with no one,

556
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:08.660
I'll just live longer to keep you company.

557
00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:11.760
Yes.

558
00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.200
Yes, please.

559
00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:16.671
You'd better.

560
00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:25.441
This is nice.

561
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:33.021
For the article on how to prevent diaper rash,

562
00:40:33.021 --> 00:40:34.450
we'll list products that are known to cause less.

563
00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.751
We can stress how breathable it is like last time, right?

564
00:40:37.621 --> 00:40:38.691
Yes.

565
00:40:39.521 --> 00:40:42.961
It's almost time to renew our advertising contract.

566
00:40:43.231 --> 00:40:44.601
How does it look on your end?

567
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:48.601
Well...

568
00:40:50.231 --> 00:40:52.001
Are things tough there too lately?

569
00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:56.340
Since we're doing the ad along with the article,

570
00:40:56.541 --> 00:40:58.711
we can try to adjust the price.

571
00:41:00.041 --> 00:41:04.220
Can you set up a meeting for me with the person in charge?

572
00:41:06.021 --> 00:41:07.851
That's not it.

573
00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:11.160
There's a rumor that "The Baby" is being discontinued,

574
00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.660
so they don't want to renew.

575
00:41:17.501 --> 00:41:19.200
It's not being discontinued, is it?

576
00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:20.871
Who says that?

577
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:23.601
That's ridiculous.

578
00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:27.970
Restructuring?

579
00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:29.740
Sales keep falling.

580
00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:31.840
We need to cut costs.

581
00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:35.851
We're short-staffed as is.

582
00:41:36.651 --> 00:41:39.180
I'm writing first drafts because we can't hire...

583
00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.450
freelancers.

584
00:41:42.651 --> 00:41:46.291
Can't we convert some employees to contract workers or freelancers?

585
00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.030
They'll probably quit then.

586
00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:51.200
Ms. Jang.

587
00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:54.930
We must overcome these difficult times wisely...

588
00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:56.901
so that "The Baby" remains...

589
00:41:57.331 --> 00:42:00.001
the nation's only magazine on infant care for decades to come.

590
00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:02.441
Then...

591
00:42:03.541 --> 00:42:06.380
I'll look for a way to increase advertisements and sales.

592
00:42:07.581 --> 00:42:09.711
Let's discuss downsizing the labor force afterward.

593
00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:14.421
Bring me a restructuring proposal at the same time.

594
00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:25.660
- Hi. - Ms. Jang.

595
00:42:25.831 --> 00:42:27.970
We lost a diaper ad.

596
00:42:28.171 --> 00:42:29.970
- Hey. - They won't renew?

597
00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.340
There's a rumor circulating that we're being discontinued,

598
00:42:35.671 --> 00:42:37.641
so people are hesitant to renew their contracts.

599
00:42:39.311 --> 00:42:42.811
Let's think of an event to show them that we're going on strong.

600
00:42:42.811 --> 00:42:46.251
And Advertising should think of ways to help with marketing too.

601
00:42:46.651 --> 00:42:48.251
Okay. Of course.

602
00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.421
Thank you.

603
00:42:51.891 --> 00:42:54.791
What about a front-page model competition?

604
00:42:54.791 --> 00:42:57.260
It was a success when we did it a while back.

605
00:42:57.461 --> 00:42:59.731
It's not bad, but isn't there something new?

606
00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:02.930
Since we have a lot of baby care goods in the warehouse,

607
00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:04.941
we can pull them out and hold a bazaar.

608
00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:06.371
That sounds lame.

609
00:43:06.541 --> 00:43:07.941
What about an online event?

610
00:43:07.941 --> 00:43:09.141
Do you have any ideas about that?

611
00:43:10.771 --> 00:43:13.840
You know those influencers on social media?

612
00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:15.711
You're young. Can't you think of anything?

613
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.720
I like the influencer idea.

614
00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.680
If we gather influencers and market on social media,

615
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:22.751
it may be more effective.

616
00:43:22.751 --> 00:43:25.791
What could we do though?

617
00:43:26.590 --> 00:43:28.061
What would be good?

618
00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.030
Are you working late starting today?

619
00:43:32.461 --> 00:43:34.271
Then I should send some late night snacks.

620
00:43:37.641 --> 00:43:40.910
I'm studying because I have an important project too.

621
00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:44.510
I never slack off if there's something to learn.

622
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:48.180
Call me if you need a driver to take you home when you finish.

623
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:52.050
(Successful Marriage Proposals)

624
00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:53.151
Okay.

625
00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:04.231
Mr. Han sent us a snack.

626
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:06.461
Come eat.

627
00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:09.570
Hey, save me some.

628
00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:10.941
I want to finish this first.

629
00:44:11.041 --> 00:44:12.771
Just eat first.

630
00:44:12.771 --> 00:44:14.410
You'll probably write better after you eat.

631
00:44:14.641 --> 00:44:15.711
Darn it.

632
00:44:17.141 --> 00:44:18.211
Come on, Ms. Jang.

633
00:44:18.211 --> 00:44:19.780
- They'll eat it all. - Okay.

634
00:44:26.151 --> 00:44:27.521
That looks yummy.

635
00:44:27.621 --> 00:44:30.691
It smells amazing.

636
00:44:31.021 --> 00:44:34.021
Mom. I'll be home late for a while because of a deadline.

637
00:44:34.191 --> 00:44:37.700
I took a night train to Donghae, so I'm not home either.

638
00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:41.171
It's time for the examination.

639
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:43.970
You're not in the hospital, are you?

640
00:44:44.771 --> 00:44:46.771
What? No, I'm not.

641
00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:49.740
- Okay. - Okay.

642
00:44:50.641 --> 00:44:51.740
Okay.

643
00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.151
- Come. - Let's eat.

644
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:02.820
Take the first bite.

645
00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:03.891
Just eat.

646
00:45:04.521 --> 00:45:06.461
- Thank you. - Thank you.

647
00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:11.760
- It's delicious. - It's so good.

648
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:13.601
It's time for the examination.

649
00:45:17.001 --> 00:45:20.771
We get the reap the benefits of her dating.

650
00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:40.360
Do you know where my mom went?

651
00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:44.160
She said her hiking club was going to Gangneung.

652
00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:46.561
- Didn't she tell you? - She did.

653
00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.001
But they don't usually go away midweek.

654
00:45:52.671 --> 00:45:53.840
Is Do Ah asleep?

655
00:45:54.941 --> 00:45:56.871
Her mom's watching her for a few days.

656
00:45:58.441 --> 00:45:59.581
That's good.

657
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.200
What happened?

658
00:46:41.751 --> 00:46:42.921
Why is the power out?

659
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:46.590
They said they were shutting it off to do a safety check.

660
00:46:47.191 --> 00:46:49.160
There was a notice.

661
00:46:50.331 --> 00:46:51.630
I didn't see it.

662
00:46:53.501 --> 00:46:54.800
Where are the candles?

663
00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:57.231
Darn it.

664
00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:07.340
Hey. The candles. The candles should be around here.

665
00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.340
I'm moving out soon.

666
00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:43.711
- Did you find a place? - Yes.

667
00:47:45.021 --> 00:47:46.050
I see.

668
00:47:48.421 --> 00:47:50.351
Have you never felt your heart flutter...

669
00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:52.490
for me even once?

670
00:47:55.231 --> 00:47:58.101
Well, very briefly in middle school when I hit puberty.

671
00:47:58.331 --> 00:47:59.930
I saw you differently.

672
00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:03.070
It was in grade school for me.

673
00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:13.811
You were my first love.

674
00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:26.061
Why are you... bringing up something from over 30 years ago?

675
00:48:27.521 --> 00:48:30.530
When we used to go to the library together in high school,

676
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.360
the kids used to say I liked you.

677
00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:36.970
They weren't teasing.

678
00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.771
Even if I had known then, nothing would've changed between us.

679
00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:45.380
Yes, it would've.

680
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.751
Either I would've been by your side until now,

681
00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:54.621
or we would've had a falling-out and never saw each other.

682
00:48:59.561 --> 00:49:01.461
I think I was too afraid of that,

683
00:49:03.231 --> 00:49:05.461
which was why I kept missing my chance to go out with you.

684
00:49:08.271 --> 00:49:09.871
What are you talking about?

685
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.470
We saw each other through countless relationships.

686
00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:14.300
Exactly.

687
00:49:15.641 --> 00:49:17.010
Why do I...

688
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:20.981
suddenly remember feelings that I had forgotten?

689
00:49:32.391 --> 00:49:35.660
Do you know what amazed me when I first got into infant care?

690
00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:38.461
I've never once fallen in my entire life.

691
00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.070
I had led an easy life,

692
00:49:42.771 --> 00:49:44.840
so I was always arrogant.

693
00:49:46.771 --> 00:49:49.941
But once my life went through turmoil at almost age 40,

694
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:53.240
it crumbled like a house of cards.

695
00:49:57.110 --> 00:49:59.720
There are a lot of good dads.

696
00:50:00.481 --> 00:50:02.351
When you first moved in here,

697
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:05.121
I thought all dads were immature brats.

698
00:50:05.121 --> 00:50:07.691
I resented my life and wondered...

699
00:50:08.561 --> 00:50:10.630
why I had to face such a hardship this late in life.

700
00:50:12.001 --> 00:50:13.601
But it wasn't a hardship.

701
00:50:14.001 --> 00:50:16.271
It was an opportunity to look back...

702
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:20.470
at what was wrong in my life and see what I had missed.

703
00:50:22.171 --> 00:50:23.671
I realized from watching you...

704
00:50:25.481 --> 00:50:27.510
that dads grow up with their kids.

705
00:50:32.521 --> 00:50:34.891
You've grown up into a great dad.

706
00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.391
It's my last chance to get back...

707
00:50:44.061 --> 00:50:46.030
what I had lost.

708
00:50:53.041 --> 00:50:54.401
I finally get it now.

709
00:50:59.081 --> 00:51:02.010
The reason I was given this last chance in life...

710
00:51:04.351 --> 00:51:05.481
was because of you.

711
00:51:19.901 --> 00:51:21.061
I'm going to go upstairs.

712
00:51:26.401 --> 00:51:27.501
Ha Ri.

713
00:51:31.941 --> 00:51:33.581
I like you a lot.

714
00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:47.220
I figured I should tell you everything...

715
00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:52.501
in order to finally end it.

716
00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.101
You shouldn't have told me.

717
00:52:05.481 --> 00:52:07.510
Why did you tell me?

718
00:52:10.711 --> 00:52:12.950
I don't want to lose you again.

719
00:52:17.550 --> 00:52:19.421
Like a teenager going through puberty,

720
00:52:20.391 --> 00:52:22.160
my heart will flutter, ache,

721
00:52:23.561 --> 00:52:25.360
and suffer from heartbreak.

722
00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:29.700
But after that, I'm sure I'll be more mature.

723
00:52:33.941 --> 00:52:36.271
Thanks to you, I'll get to grow up a little.

724
00:52:43.811 --> 00:52:45.421
Thank you for everything.

725
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:48.421
And I'm sorry for a lot of things as well.

726
00:52:53.921 --> 00:52:55.160
Ha Ri.

727
00:53:00.101 --> 00:53:02.901
I hope you're always happy, Ha Ri.

(Leather Atelier)

729
00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:33.660
- Hello? - Ha Ri.

730
00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:36.791
Is something wrong with your mother?

731
00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:38.831
She didn't come to the workshop today.

732
00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:41.671
She's probably not back from her hiking club yet.

733
00:54:43.271 --> 00:54:44.601
Okay.

734
00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:06.760
Hey, Aunt. Is my mom sick?

735
00:55:07.561 --> 00:55:09.231
Has her stomach cancer recurred?

736
00:55:10.231 --> 00:55:13.260
Tell me what's going on. Don't keep it from me.

737
00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.470
Do you want me to work without knowing how sick she is?

738
00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.271
That will only break my heart.

739
00:55:20.671 --> 00:55:22.410
I'll only end up regretting it.

740
00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.311
What's my mom doing there?

741
00:55:42.637 --> 00:55:45.108
(Aunt Ok Ran)

742
00:55:47.378 --> 00:55:48.577
Hey, Auntie.

743

Jae Young.

744
00:55:50.117 --> 00:55:52.418
I'm at the hospital right now.

745
00:55:52.818 --> 00:55:55.717
I feel like Ha Ri might come and cry her eyes out.

746
00:55:55.958 --> 00:55:57.517
Can you come and take her home?

747
00:55:58.628 --> 00:56:00.488
Yes, please do me a favor.

748
00:56:00.887 --> 00:56:01.958
Thanks.

749

(Jang T Seob)

750
00:56:45.967 --> 00:56:47.068
Hey, you're here.

751
00:56:47.438 --> 00:56:48.637
What are you doing here?

752
00:56:51.037 --> 00:56:52.077
Ha Ri, is that you?

753
00:56:54.347 --> 00:56:57.617
My goodness, you've grown into a beautiful woman.

754
00:56:58.378 --> 00:57:00.088
I heard you turned 39 this year.

755
00:57:18.467 --> 00:57:21.008
Ha Ri, give me that and leave.

756
00:57:21.438 --> 00:57:22.978
You don't need to worry about him.

757
00:57:23.137 --> 00:57:24.637
It's not any of your business either.

758
00:57:25.878 --> 00:57:27.048
You're not married anymore.

759
00:57:28.008 --> 00:57:29.818
Why are you here taking care of him?

760
00:57:31.517 --> 00:57:32.988
He has late-stage liver cancer.

761
00:57:33.188 --> 00:57:34.418
He can live if he gets surgery,

762
00:57:34.418 --> 00:57:35.617
so I'm going to leave once he receives surgery.

763
00:57:35.617 --> 00:57:37.717
Why would you stay for that?

764
00:57:43.398 --> 00:57:46.997
If you're so worried, hire a caregiver for him.

765
00:57:48.668 --> 00:57:51.907
Why would you do this for him after all that he's put you through?

766
00:57:53.537 --> 00:57:56.378
I'll deal with it. Just go and do your job.

767
00:57:56.378 --> 00:57:58.177
You resent him, too.

768
00:57:59.278 --> 00:58:01.208
If he didn't leave us,

769
00:58:01.648 --> 00:58:05.287
you wouldn't have to work so hard every day...

770
00:58:05.287 --> 00:58:06.447
from 4am to 10pm.

771
00:58:07.747 --> 00:58:11.157
My heart still aches every time I think about how hard you worked.

772
00:58:11.258 --> 00:58:13.327
Why do you still remember that?

773
00:58:13.327 --> 00:58:14.758
This is why I didn't want you to meet your dad.

774
00:58:14.758 --> 00:58:15.858
Why did you come here?

775
00:58:16.097 --> 00:58:17.827
I'm not doing this because I care for him,

776
00:58:17.827 --> 00:58:19.497
so just forget what you saw and go back to work.

777
00:58:19.728 --> 00:58:21.867
No, I don't want to see you here.

778
00:58:21.867 --> 00:58:23.867
I'm doing this for a reason.

779
00:58:23.867 --> 00:58:26.068
It hurts to see you here like this!

780
00:58:28.938 --> 00:58:32.208
Will you feel at ease if someone tells you later on...

781
00:58:32.208 --> 00:58:33.307
that your dad died sick and homeless?

782
00:58:33.947 --> 00:58:36.117
I'm not doing this for him. I'm doing this for myself.

783
00:58:36.117 --> 00:58:38.217
I'm doing this so you won't end up getting hurt.

784
00:58:38.278 --> 00:58:39.688
So stop causing a fuss.

785
00:58:40.017 --> 00:58:41.818
- Just go. - Why would I get hurt?

786
00:58:43.387 --> 00:58:45.688
He was never around, so who cares if he dies?

787
00:58:46.787 --> 00:58:49.197
He never showed up after he left.

788
00:58:49.258 --> 00:58:50.497
So who cares if he's sick?

789
00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:52.267
I don't even hate him anymore.

790
00:58:53.528 --> 00:58:55.197
I don't want to waste my time hurting because of him.

791
00:59:01.767 --> 00:59:03.108
I'm sorry.

792
00:59:04.577 --> 00:59:07.778
You ended up with a dad like him because of me.

793
00:59:08.648 --> 00:59:11.217
Why are you sorry?

794
00:59:13.418 --> 00:59:14.988
I'm okay, so just leave.

795
01:00:03.537 --> 01:00:04.637
Hello?

796
01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:06.238
Mr. Han.

797
01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:14.008
Right, got it.

798
01:01:05.497 --> 01:01:06.568
It's all right.

799
01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:08.767
It's all right.

800
01:01:11.467 --> 01:01:12.537
Please don't cry.

801
01:01:14.867 --> 01:01:15.978
I'm here for you.

802
01:02:29.577 --> 01:02:32.488
Dr. Jang, please come to the OR.

803
01:02:32.488 --> 01:02:33.588
(Patients in surgery)

804
01:02:56.307 --> 01:02:59.247
(In surgery, Recovery)

805
01:03:15.188 --> 01:03:17.128
I just don't get it.

806
01:03:20.197 --> 01:03:22.097
I may hate him, but he's still my dad.

807
01:03:23.537 --> 01:03:25.467
That's why I get to see him whether I like it or not.

808
01:03:27.708 --> 01:03:29.637
But why can't my mom sever ties with him...

809
01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:31.978
even though they're already divorced?

810
01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:36.677
When love lets me down...

811
01:03:38.017 --> 01:03:40.688
and the one I love hurts me deeply,

812
01:03:43.887 --> 01:03:46.458
will I be able to stay strong...

813
01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:47.887
like my mom?

814
01:03:55.168 --> 01:03:56.967
Ha Ri, I know you're busy,

815
01:03:57.338 --> 01:04:00.807
but could you perhaps meet me at the studio?

816
01:04:09.117 --> 01:04:10.278
Ha Ri.

817
01:04:14.688 --> 01:04:15.818
Have a seat.

818
01:04:22.128 --> 01:04:25.497
We haven't taken a photo together yet.

819
01:04:29.467 --> 01:04:32.508
Just smile at that camera over there.

820
01:04:42.347 --> 01:04:44.918
Let's take photos...

821
01:04:45.617 --> 01:04:48.787
during the days we are together...

822
01:04:49.688 --> 01:04:51.958
and of all our shared moments.

823
01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:32.528
Ha Ri.

824
01:05:50.778 --> 01:05:51.778
Let's...

825
01:06:23.378 --> 01:06:24.517
get married.

(Oh My Baby)

827
01:07:05.118 --> 01:07:06.228
I'm sorry.

828
01:07:07.328 --> 01:07:08.358
Then...

829
01:07:10.057 --> 01:07:11.597
The ring.

830
01:07:14.368 --> 01:07:18.498
After the surgery, I'll have less of a chance to get pregnant.

831
01:07:18.767 --> 01:07:22.137
We'll have to see the results, but your chances might get slimmer.

832
01:07:22.337 --> 01:07:23.377
Ha Ri!

833
01:07:23.978 --> 01:07:25.677
Ha Ri, open up!

834
01:07:25.978 --> 01:07:29.047
She won't be suffering this much if she had chosen me.

835
01:07:29.448 --> 01:07:31.417
Telling me to get the surgery...

836
01:07:31.877 --> 01:07:34.288
is like telling me to give up on having a child.
