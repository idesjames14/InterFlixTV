00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:49.695
My goodness.

2
00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:52.026
(Congratulations on your return.)

3
00:00:57.335 --> 00:00:58.506
Thank you.

4
00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:02.506
Ha Ri.

5
00:01:04.175 --> 00:01:05.745
I loved your column.

6
00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:07.676
- Really? - Me too.

7
00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:10.375
I liked it, too.

8
00:01:10.815 --> 00:01:12.786
Thanks, you guys.

9
00:01:14.656 --> 00:01:17.856
Whether it was good or bad, you still need to come with me.

10
00:01:18.455 --> 00:01:21.926
But I just got here. I need to organize some stuff...

11
00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:22.955
Follow me.

12
00:01:30.036 --> 00:01:31.665
I'll convince the readers...

13
00:01:32.406 --> 00:01:34.265
like a true magazine journalist.

14
00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:37.735
"Convince"?

15
00:01:37.976 --> 00:01:40.175
I asked you to write an apology.

16
00:01:40.175 --> 00:01:42.875
Who told you to write a journal?

17
00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:44.615
Do you take this as a joke?

18
00:01:45.985 --> 00:01:47.645
How lightly do you take our readers?

19
00:01:48.955 --> 00:01:50.455
Aren't you scared of me?

20
00:02:24.216 --> 00:02:26.086
He didn't scold me as much as I thought he would.

21
00:02:26.586 --> 00:02:27.856
I'm so relieved.

22
00:02:29.425 --> 00:02:31.425
Drink up. It's on me.

23
00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:35.065
Are you buying because you know I'll get fired tomorrow?

24
00:02:36.395 --> 00:02:38.666
My gosh, I forgot my ID for the job search site.

25
00:02:39.865 --> 00:02:41.836
My resignation letter will act as your weapon.

26
00:02:43.505 --> 00:02:45.906
I understand why the company is so angry.

27
00:02:46.206 --> 00:02:48.815
But I will have to start over once I have a career break.

28
00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:51.516
And it's hard to get another job as editor-in-chief.

29
00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:54.986
Plus, I'm too old to study something new and start anew.

30
00:02:56.486 --> 00:02:58.855
So you're just going to quit?

31
00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:03.695
My baby had a febrile seizure.

32
00:03:04.095 --> 00:03:05.665
If it gets worse, it could cause epilepsy.

33
00:03:05.665 --> 00:03:07.125
So I need to be with him.

34
00:03:08.535 --> 00:03:09.936
It's nothing serious.

35
00:03:10.896 --> 00:03:13.906
But I can't even take care of my firstborn either.

36
00:03:14.466 --> 00:03:17.035
I forgot to pack his blanket, so for the past week,

37
00:03:17.035 --> 00:03:19.375
he had to take naps at the daycare center without one.

38
00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.345
I felt so sorry that I got angry at myself.

39
00:03:24.276 --> 00:03:25.586
So I'm going to quit.

40
00:03:28.355 --> 00:03:31.216
But this is too sudden.

41
00:03:31.216 --> 00:03:33.526
That way, they won't be able to fire you.

42
00:03:34.156 --> 00:03:35.426
You're the only person...

43
00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:37.825
who's been working here for 15 years.

44
00:03:38.095 --> 00:03:40.695
No one in the company has shown more loyalty or affection than you have.

45
00:03:41.396 --> 00:03:43.766
What's so wrong about not having a baby?

46
00:03:44.595 --> 00:03:46.406
I guess having a baby could help gain credibility,

47
00:03:46.406 --> 00:03:48.475
but I can't even take care of my own baby properly.

48
00:03:52.505 --> 00:03:54.605
- Ms. Shim. - I'm going to quit...

49
00:03:54.716 --> 00:03:57.075
after I make sure you become the editor-in-chief.

50
00:03:57.415 --> 00:03:59.146
And this is solely out of my personal interest.

51
00:03:59.986 --> 00:04:01.285
I may have been mean to you,

52
00:04:01.285 --> 00:04:03.686
but you were the only one who truly understood me.

53
00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:06.926
I want you to become the editor-in-chief.

54
00:04:11.896 --> 00:04:12.966
Drink up.

55
00:04:33.716 --> 00:04:35.785
The treatment didn't work last time.

56
00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:38.026
Would you still like to give it another try?

57
00:04:49.236 --> 00:04:51.165
What if you meet someone you love?

58
00:04:51.706 --> 00:04:54.435
So you've never once wanted to be a dad?

59
00:04:56.175 --> 00:04:57.506
No, never.

60
00:04:59.845 --> 00:05:02.216
Who knew you'd make my heart ache like this?

61
00:05:19.396 --> 00:05:20.896
Stop it.

62
00:05:20.896 --> 00:05:23.165
Jae Young, stop it already!

63
00:05:23.935 --> 00:05:25.305
- Hey! - Wait.

64
00:05:25.665 --> 00:05:27.865
Let go! Stop it!

65
00:05:40.115 --> 00:05:41.415
Mr. Han!

66
00:06:00.506 --> 00:06:01.506
What are you doing?

67
00:06:06.146 --> 00:06:09.376
You don't seem that happy to see me.

68
00:06:10.516 --> 00:06:13.446
It looks like you want to be alone. I'll just leave.

69
00:06:15.855 --> 00:06:17.016
Don't go.

70
00:06:20.225 --> 00:06:21.595
Let's chat.

71
00:06:30.435 --> 00:06:31.605
What did you do today?

72
00:06:35.136 --> 00:06:38.076
Life felt like a math problem, so I was trying to solve it.

73
00:06:39.876 --> 00:06:43.646
I want to get the right answer, but it's quite hard.

74
00:06:45.985 --> 00:06:47.345
That's deep.

75
00:06:47.485 --> 00:06:49.586
Did I ask you a philosophical question?

76
00:06:50.415 --> 00:06:53.785
"I slacked off after I finished my work."

77
00:06:54.185 --> 00:06:57.355
"Then I came for a walk in the park and suddenly thought of you."

78
00:06:57.925 --> 00:06:59.665
I was expecting something more like that.

79
00:07:01.396 --> 00:07:02.696
Wait. Why would you think of me?

80
00:07:07.605 --> 00:07:08.805
I know, right?

81
00:07:09.605 --> 00:07:13.206
Why would I suddenly think of you?

82
00:07:18.886 --> 00:07:20.545
You could've thought of me.

83
00:07:21.615 --> 00:07:25.185
We ran into each other often here, and we're neighbors.

84
00:07:25.425 --> 00:07:28.396
You might wonder what I'm doing and when I might...

85
00:07:29.095 --> 00:07:30.626
come out for a walk.

86
00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:33.365
You seemed a bit weird.

87
00:07:33.995 --> 00:07:37.766
Normally, people pretend to be fine even though they're hurt.

88
00:07:38.735 --> 00:07:40.466
They hide their scars...

89
00:07:41.165 --> 00:07:42.975
and try their best to look okay.

90
00:07:44.376 --> 00:07:46.975
But every time I'm with you,

91
00:07:47.776 --> 00:07:50.675
I suddenly feel embarrassed...

92
00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:53.316
for trying to act so tough.

93
00:07:57.855 --> 00:08:00.326
You were so shocked that you asked a guy to marry you...

94
00:08:01.055 --> 00:08:04.626
even though you didn't like him that much.

95
00:08:07.066 --> 00:08:08.435
But on top of that,

96
00:08:09.735 --> 00:08:11.805
you even confessed that to the world.

97
00:08:12.506 --> 00:08:14.466
You're so brave, Ms. Jang.

98
00:08:20.276 --> 00:08:22.045
I'm saying this because I'm drunk.

99
00:08:23.175 --> 00:08:24.576
Ms. Jang.

100
00:08:26.316 --> 00:08:27.646
Good job.

101
00:08:36.225 --> 00:08:37.555
I'll do this...

102
00:08:38.826 --> 00:08:40.266
instead of giving you a stamp.

103
00:09:02.785 --> 00:09:05.555
I feel so much better thanks to you.

104
00:09:07.026 --> 00:09:08.325
Thank you...

105
00:09:08.996 --> 00:09:10.195
for acknowledging me.

106
00:09:14.925 --> 00:09:16.065
Mom.

107
00:09:17.136 --> 00:09:18.335
I Sang.

108
00:09:19.406 --> 00:09:20.805
Go home safely.

109
00:09:22.736 --> 00:09:25.276
You should've called before you came.

110
00:09:25.575 --> 00:09:28.915
No, it's okay. I know you're busy.

111
00:09:29.715 --> 00:09:33.116
I left the fermented flounder in the security office.

112
00:09:33.516 --> 00:09:36.455
But who is she?

113
00:09:39.486 --> 00:09:40.726
Hello.

114
00:09:40.756 --> 00:09:42.496
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

115
00:09:42.496 --> 00:09:45.496
She's just a colleague. Let's go home.

116
00:09:47.065 --> 00:09:50.465
I'm not really interested in seeing your place.

117
00:09:50.465 --> 00:09:52.805
Let me go. Let go.

118
00:09:53.835 --> 00:09:56.035
What's your name?

119
00:09:56.035 --> 00:09:58.746
My name is Jang Ha Ri.

120
00:09:58.906 --> 00:10:00.346
"Ha Ri"?

121
00:10:02.045 --> 00:10:04.616
You're beautiful, and so is your name.

122
00:10:04.776 --> 00:10:06.016
Thank you.

123
00:10:07.616 --> 00:10:09.016
You should go.

124
00:10:09.986 --> 00:10:12.185
- Let me help you get home. - What?

125
00:10:12.825 --> 00:10:14.226
Just wait a second.

126
00:10:15.596 --> 00:10:18.366
You two must be coming back from somewhere.

127
00:10:20.795 --> 00:10:22.366
Anyway, don't worry.

128
00:10:22.795 --> 00:10:25.906
I never step foot inside his house,

129
00:10:26.305 --> 00:10:29.305
so come by to have fun whenever you like.

130
00:10:29.305 --> 00:10:31.006
Ma'am, we're not...

131
00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:33.175
You have the wrong idea about us.

132
00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:35.045
You should get going. Gosh, I'm sorry.

133
00:10:35.045 --> 00:10:36.376
- Mother... - Good job, I Sang.

134
00:10:36.376 --> 00:10:38.016
- Mom, please. - Good job!

135
00:10:38.215 --> 00:10:39.386
- Don't be like this. - Wait.

136
00:10:39.445 --> 00:10:40.915
- Hold on. - Mom, please.

137
00:10:41.285 --> 00:10:43.415
- Please head home. - I like him, ma'am.

138
00:10:44.285 --> 00:10:45.555
- What? - That's right.

139
00:10:49.656 --> 00:10:51.656
I like Mr. Han.

140
00:10:54.325 --> 00:10:55.965
My gosh.

141
00:10:58.465 --> 00:10:59.565
Do you really?

142
00:11:00.106 --> 00:11:02.136
So please don't worry.

143
00:11:02.535 --> 00:11:04.575
Right, my gosh.

144
00:11:05.406 --> 00:11:07.976
Thank you so much. Thank you.

145
00:11:10.215 --> 00:11:11.986
Here's my cab.

146
00:11:12.616 --> 00:11:14.815
- I'll see you around. - Good night, ma'am.

147
00:11:16.555 --> 00:11:19.555
I Sang, take care!

148
00:12:03.996 --> 00:12:05.665
- What? - Have you had dinner?

149
00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:07.535
Of course. Do you know what time it is?

150
00:12:07.665 --> 00:12:09.606
- Did you have tripe? - Why tripe?

151
00:12:09.606 --> 00:12:11.506
They never serve just one portion.

152
00:12:12.276 --> 00:12:13.506
I already had dinner.

153
00:12:13.506 --> 00:12:15.075
It's why I'm telling you to eat tripe.

154
00:12:15.075 --> 00:12:16.476
Wash up and go to bed.

155
00:12:16.575 --> 00:12:17.715
I quit eating tripe.

156
00:12:36.565 --> 00:12:38.266
Did I do something wrong?

157
00:12:46.506 --> 00:12:48.846
Why is everything so easy with you?

158
00:12:49.675 --> 00:12:52.386
Your mother seemed worried, so...

159
00:12:52.585 --> 00:12:54.215
How can you love someone depending on what you see?

160
00:12:55.656 --> 00:12:56.815
We're not kids anymore...

161
00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:01.026
We know better now...

162
00:13:01.226 --> 00:13:04.026
than to begin a relationship neither of us can handle.

163
00:13:07.126 --> 00:13:08.965
Why is everything so complicated?

164
00:13:13.266 --> 00:13:14.366
Because I know how it'll end.

165
00:13:17.976 --> 00:13:19.146
You...

166
00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:22.376
want kids.

167
00:13:27.215 --> 00:13:29.415
I don't.

168
00:13:31.256 --> 00:13:33.555
You'll end up getting hurt...

169
00:13:34.156 --> 00:13:36.356
and I won't be responsible for that.

170
00:13:36.996 --> 00:13:38.096
Mr. Han,

171
00:13:41.695 --> 00:13:43.766
my feelings are for me to handle.

172
00:13:51.006 --> 00:13:53.705
I guess I got carried away and made a mistake.

173
00:13:55.516 --> 00:13:57.545
From now on, please watch your actions...

174
00:13:58.585 --> 00:14:00.146
so that I don't get the wrong idea.

175
00:14:26.175 --> 00:14:27.675
What a pathetic pity party.

176
00:14:29.616 --> 00:14:30.915
And you said you wouldn't eat.

177
00:14:30.915 --> 00:14:32.585
You should've suggested alcohol.

178
00:14:32.585 --> 00:14:33.846
But I'm not going to have any.

179
00:14:35.915 --> 00:14:38.726
How can you eat tripe without soju?

180
00:14:38.986 --> 00:14:40.085
I don't want to get drunk.

181
00:14:40.486 --> 00:14:42.455
Whoever it is...

182
00:14:42.455 --> 00:14:44.856
shouldn't make you pity yourself.

183
00:14:47.195 --> 00:14:48.366
What guy?

184
00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:49.736
Sure, whatever.

185
00:14:54.866 --> 00:14:56.535
I can't believe...

186
00:14:57.435 --> 00:14:58.805
I read so much into it.

187
00:15:01.606 --> 00:15:02.646
It?

188
00:15:02.646 --> 00:15:05.886
I solidified my life's goal with how it didn't need to involve men,

189
00:15:09.555 --> 00:15:11.715
but the incident made my mind go fuzzy.

190
00:15:16.695 --> 00:15:19.295
Are you perhaps talking about a kiss?

191
00:15:20.195 --> 00:15:22.165
I lost my judgment...

192
00:15:22.695 --> 00:15:23.965
because it hadn't happened in a while.

193
00:15:25.266 --> 00:15:26.366
Did you sleep with him?

194
00:15:27.465 --> 00:15:29.976
What nonsense are you spewing?

195
00:15:30.506 --> 00:15:33.045
- And lower your voice. - My gosh.

196
00:15:36.215 --> 00:15:37.746
As long as it didn't happen.

197
00:15:38.785 --> 00:15:39.945
Unbelievable.

198
00:15:40.246 --> 00:15:41.846
Your world can spin...

199
00:15:44.756 --> 00:15:46.356
at a single touch or gaze...

200
00:15:47.226 --> 00:15:48.455
even when you're almost 40.

201
00:15:50.596 --> 00:15:52.626
You're better off living alone.

202
00:16:01.636 --> 00:16:04.776
Why would you fall for a guy who doesn't make a move?

203
00:16:04.776 --> 00:16:06.006
Forget about him already.

204
00:16:10.646 --> 00:16:12.215
It would've been different if he were 20.

205
00:16:13.215 --> 00:16:17.116
He wouldn't be this hesitant if he were still 30.

206
00:16:20.785 --> 00:16:22.596
Just like I'm running out of time,

207
00:16:24.896 --> 00:16:27.026
he must have his reasons for pushing me away.

208
00:16:27.026 --> 00:16:28.935
Why are you trying to understand him?

209
00:16:28.935 --> 00:16:30.736
Who cares about what he's going through?

210
00:16:31.665 --> 00:16:32.906
You said you were out of time.

211
00:16:36.175 --> 00:16:39.776
I'm a doctor, so why didn't you tell me about your condition?

212
00:16:41.006 --> 00:16:43.876
I didn't know that pediatricians dealt with infertility too.

213
00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:45.785
We can all consult on medical matters.

214
00:16:48.016 --> 00:16:49.215
Unbelievable.

215
00:16:51.215 --> 00:16:52.585
So what is it that you want?

216
00:16:53.285 --> 00:16:55.325
You said you didn't have the time to date and get married...

217
00:16:55.496 --> 00:16:57.896
nor have you been happy because of a guy.

218
00:17:02.996 --> 00:17:04.266
Is it still romance you want though?

219
00:17:06.705 --> 00:17:09.636
It hurts to finally let go, you know.

220
00:17:14.445 --> 00:17:17.215
Anyway, I would've given anything to be 20 today.

221
00:17:20.116 --> 00:17:22.585
Then I would've clung onto him as if there's no tomorrow.

(Episode 7: The Realistic Distance that Doesn't Cause a Heartbreak)

224
00:17:43.876 --> 00:17:46.505
The background can be out of focus.

225
00:17:47.975 --> 00:17:51.046
How can I do that when there's no background?

226
00:17:51.175 --> 00:17:52.415
Is this a joke?

227
00:17:52.685 --> 00:17:56.586
Can't you manage this vibe with that item we have?

228
00:17:56.715 --> 00:17:58.455
You could if you're a good photographer.

229
00:18:00.356 --> 00:18:02.356
At least bring me some decent props first.

230
00:18:02.356 --> 00:18:04.995
Also, it's not up to you to decide whether I'm good or not.

231
00:18:05.866 --> 00:18:07.965
You have a way of making things complicated, don't you?

232
00:18:07.965 --> 00:18:09.596
Why can't you just do as you're asked?

233
00:18:09.935 --> 00:18:11.096
Ms. Choi,

234
00:18:11.995 --> 00:18:13.965
Let's not cross the line, okay?

235
00:18:14.165 --> 00:18:17.336
Belittling someone else doesn't make you suddenly competent.

236
00:18:18.435 --> 00:18:19.505
Mr. Han.

237
00:18:23.616 --> 00:18:25.985
Please shoot the photo that Ms. Choi asked for.

238
00:18:36.156 --> 00:18:38.156
From planning the article, deciding on the photos,

239
00:18:38.156 --> 00:18:40.396
and choosing the props were all done by Ms. Choi.

240
00:18:40.925 --> 00:18:43.566
We'll evaluate the photos once we see them.

241
00:18:45.136 --> 00:18:48.465
A second photoshoot will only waste our time.

242
00:18:48.465 --> 00:18:50.036
Who are you to waste the time and effort...

243
00:18:50.136 --> 00:18:51.975
of the photographer and his crew?

244
00:18:51.975 --> 00:18:53.076
That also...

245
00:18:53.745 --> 00:18:56.745
is up to the journalist in charge.

246
00:19:02.586 --> 00:19:03.915
- Organize them like so. - Sure thing.

247
00:19:06.326 --> 00:19:07.386
What...

248
00:19:08.126 --> 00:19:09.225
Unbelievable.

249
00:19:14.165 --> 00:19:16.396
I took your side so that you can take responsibility.

250
00:19:17.735 --> 00:19:20.136
You know that this is your fault.

251
00:19:20.265 --> 00:19:22.406
I couldn't let him have the upper hand though...

252
00:19:22.406 --> 00:19:24.175
especially when he's an outside hire.

253
00:19:24.435 --> 00:19:26.775
Just because he was once a hotshot photographer...

254
00:19:26.775 --> 00:19:28.505
doesn't mean that he can undermine me.

255
00:19:30.076 --> 00:19:31.715
Do you consider me as your superior?

256
00:19:33.985 --> 00:19:35.286
The photographer and designer...

257
00:19:35.286 --> 00:19:36.985
are your partners, not your subordinates.

258
00:19:39.955 --> 00:19:41.455
I guess I should apologize.

259
00:19:42.755 --> 00:19:46.665
I didn't want to seem patronizing, so I didn't teach you properly.

260
00:19:47.366 --> 00:19:50.336
Who would be fond of being told what to do?

261
00:19:50.796 --> 00:19:53.235
I figured you'd watch and learn, but that was wrong of me.

262
00:19:55.205 --> 00:19:58.036
I don't intend to work here for very long.

263
00:19:58.136 --> 00:20:00.675
I know that you search for other jobs every day.

264
00:20:02.376 --> 00:20:03.846
Is that why you're slacking off?

265
00:20:04.915 --> 00:20:06.715
No way!

266
00:20:07.116 --> 00:20:08.515
I've been trying to do my best.

267
00:20:08.515 --> 00:20:10.255
Instead of trying to do well,

268
00:20:10.356 --> 00:20:11.915
actually do well.

269
00:20:12.386 --> 00:20:15.796
If you don't take pride in your work, work is just torture.

270
00:20:16.955 --> 00:20:18.656
I'm going to scold you from now on.

271
00:20:18.695 --> 00:20:21.366
I won't say it's good enough anymore.

272
00:20:21.826 --> 00:20:24.136
I'll hound you until you produce something better.

273
00:20:25.096 --> 00:20:28.005
So that wherever you go, you'll be respected for what you learned here.

274
00:20:32.306 --> 00:20:34.205
Put together a portfolio...

275
00:20:34.205 --> 00:20:36.616
that you can show proudly before you quit.

276
00:20:40.185 --> 00:20:41.515
Let's take a break.

277
00:20:50.225 --> 00:20:52.025
I chose the picture of the infertile couple.

278
00:20:56.066 --> 00:20:59.005
The kids must have learned from me because I was disrespectful to you.

279
00:21:00.366 --> 00:21:02.036
I'm sorry for making them mistreat you.

280
00:21:09.715 --> 00:21:10.775
Okay.

281
00:21:15.245 --> 00:21:16.415
I hope...

282
00:21:17.215 --> 00:21:18.586
you won't...

283
00:21:19.485 --> 00:21:21.725
be hurt because of...

284
00:21:22.826 --> 00:21:23.896
me.

285
00:21:27.896 --> 00:21:29.995
I guess I got carried away and made a mistake.

286
00:21:31.235 --> 00:21:33.366
From now on, please watch your actions...

287
00:21:34.265 --> 00:21:35.935
so that I don't get the wrong idea.

288
00:21:59.126 --> 00:22:00.396
I...

289
00:22:02.195 --> 00:22:04.596
broke up with my long-term girlfriend...

290
00:22:05.695 --> 00:22:07.066
after we were engaged.

291
00:22:08.465 --> 00:22:11.636
I gave up on the idea of marriage since then,

292
00:22:13.275 --> 00:22:15.175
and there are no kids in my future.

293
00:22:16.876 --> 00:22:18.675
I didn't want to like anyone again,

294
00:22:20.116 --> 00:22:21.646
but I got swept away.

295
00:22:22.786 --> 00:22:24.786
My motives were unclear.

296
00:22:25.786 --> 00:22:27.556
It's natural that you were misled.

297
00:22:29.596 --> 00:22:31.556
So I was mistaken.

298
00:22:32.096 --> 00:22:34.066
I thought hard about it,

299
00:22:35.866 --> 00:22:38.235
but I still like being alone.

300
00:22:39.636 --> 00:22:42.836
I had decided to live alone many years ago...

301
00:22:43.536 --> 00:22:45.735
and set my path in life accordingly.

302
00:22:54.086 --> 00:22:55.586
I'm sorry...

303
00:22:58.616 --> 00:22:59.656
for confusing you.

304
00:23:03.126 --> 00:23:04.455
I accept your apology.

305
00:23:05.965 --> 00:23:08.326
You didn't want to like anyone, right? Me too.

306
00:23:08.665 --> 00:23:11.465
It was brief, but it was too complicated and uncomfortable.

307
00:23:15.235 --> 00:23:17.205
- Let's not be awkward. - Okay.

308
00:23:17.705 --> 00:23:18.836
Let's not.

309
00:24:44.126 --> 00:24:45.296
It's so pretty.

They dumped leftover inventory on us. What will you do about it?

He's new at this. Cut him some slack.

317
00:25:27.366 --> 00:25:28.935

00:25:30.735 --> 00:25:31.806
Okay.

Didn't you tell Advertising to check expiration dates?

321
00:25:37.316 --> 00:25:39.546
Well. So, I...

322
00:25:40.515 --> 00:25:42.515
meant to tell him...

323
00:25:50.725 --> 00:25:52.556
I heard but forgot.

324
00:25:53.096 --> 00:25:54.265

How can we send these back?

328
00:26:05.675 --> 00:26:07.675
It was so hard to get...

329

Just say it with words.

330
00:26:13.386 --> 00:26:15.286
Don't say it with your eyes.

Yes, sir.

335
00:26:32.396 --> 00:26:33.435

I meant to tell you,

339
00:26:56.596 --> 00:26:59.765
but I forgot because I was stunned by the counterfeit slippers.

340
00:27:01.626 --> 00:27:02.866
I see.

341
00:27:04.296 --> 00:27:07.665
Anyway, were you helping me?

342
00:27:11.876 --> 00:27:13.646
I didn't want you to get scolded.

343
00:27:15.106 --> 00:27:17.515
You were scolded already earlier. I thought you'd get angry...

344
00:27:17.515 --> 00:27:19.046
if you got scolded again.

345
00:27:19.846 --> 00:27:22.586
Why do you keep getting scolded, anyway?

346
00:27:22.786 --> 00:27:24.656
I get scolded because I'm new.

347
00:27:25.015 --> 00:27:26.656
I did not get scolded!

348
00:27:28.725 --> 00:27:30.195
I guess you're just an angry person.

349
00:27:32.896 --> 00:27:34.366
But you know,

350
00:27:34.725 --> 00:27:37.566
I tried to only say hello since that's what you said to do,

351
00:27:37.836 --> 00:27:41.306
but you keep talking to me.

352
00:27:43.306 --> 00:27:47.106
Are you arguing with me because I started a conversation?

353
00:27:47.546 --> 00:27:50.116
No, no. I prefer talking to you...

354
00:27:50.116 --> 00:27:52.116
over just saying hi.

355
00:27:54.015 --> 00:27:56.286
Shall we talk for a while next time too?

356
00:27:58.116 --> 00:28:00.786
I'll go now. Wish me luck.

357
00:28:05.995 --> 00:28:09.096
He just told me he likes me, didn't he?

358
00:28:09.695 --> 00:28:11.636
Talk about lame.

359
00:28:21.705 --> 00:28:24.475
What's with that smile? It's very annoying.

360
00:28:25.116 --> 00:28:26.286
What do you want?

361
00:28:27.215 --> 00:28:28.445
I just want to eat with you.

362
00:28:28.445 --> 00:28:30.586
Why would you come all the way here to buy me lunch?

363
00:28:30.685 --> 00:28:32.515
I don't want to eat alone, that's why.

364
00:28:32.826 --> 00:28:33.985
Let's go.

365
00:28:34.025 --> 00:28:37.356
You look like someone hitting on a girl.

366
00:28:37.556 --> 00:28:38.656
Just follow me!

367
00:28:44.866 --> 00:28:45.935
Here.

368
00:28:48.505 --> 00:28:51.606
I have no money. I have no time. I can't do anything.

369
00:28:52.376 --> 00:28:54.705
I just wanted to eat with you. That's why I came.

370
00:28:55.445 --> 00:28:57.475
Stop glaring at me. Let's enjoy our food.

371
00:28:58.915 --> 00:29:02.215
I thought about this, considering our 39-year-long friendship.

372
00:29:02.515 --> 00:29:05.386
You're terminally ill. You could die any day.

373
00:29:05.386 --> 00:29:08.485
Then there's no reason why I can't help you out.

374
00:29:10.755 --> 00:29:11.955
I'll marry you.

375
00:29:17.695 --> 00:29:20.435
Think about it for 5... No, 1 minute.

376
00:29:20.705 --> 00:29:22.636
Sure. It tastes good.

377
00:29:22.765 --> 00:29:24.435
Can you at least pretend to think about it?

378
00:29:30.116 --> 00:29:31.475
Honey, is dinner almost ready?

379
00:29:32.515 --> 00:29:34.046
Did you wash my socks?

380
00:29:34.245 --> 00:29:36.886
- Socks? - And I need my shirt ironed...

381
00:29:36.886 --> 00:29:39.185
nice and stiff for tomorrow.

382
00:29:39.415 --> 00:29:41.455
I'm going to soak in the tub after dinner,

383
00:29:41.685 --> 00:29:44.925
so draw a bath for me. I want the water at 39.5 degrees.

384
00:29:44.925 --> 00:29:46.156
I'm a bit sensitive.

385
00:29:47.126 --> 00:29:48.995
You're killing my appetite.

386
00:29:48.995 --> 00:29:51.195
Just hire a housekeeper.

387
00:29:51.265 --> 00:29:53.606
Why do you hate the idea that much?

388
00:29:53.665 --> 00:29:55.665
- Is it that bad? - Obviously, it isn't good.

389
00:29:55.836 --> 00:29:59.205
I appreciate the concern, but why are you risking our friendship?

390
00:29:59.275 --> 00:30:00.606
What's gotten into you lately?

391
00:30:00.846 --> 00:30:02.175
Am I that pitiful?

392
00:30:03.616 --> 00:30:05.915
Lately, I've been...

393
00:30:13.886 --> 00:30:15.086
I'm just lonely.

394
00:30:16.255 --> 00:30:17.396
Do you have andropause?

395
00:30:17.396 --> 00:30:19.995
Do you feel lonely, dejected, and suddenly find yourself in tears?

396
00:30:19.995 --> 00:30:21.665
No, it's more like puberty.

397
00:30:21.965 --> 00:30:24.495
My feelings are all over the place these days.

398
00:30:28.366 --> 00:30:29.836
So you should...

399
00:30:30.435 --> 00:30:32.945
look at me once in a while and make sure I stay on track.

400
00:30:40.445 --> 00:30:42.485
I am looking at you. Eat up.

401
00:30:45.185 --> 00:30:47.286
Make sure you chew. You don't want to get sick.

402
00:30:53.096 --> 00:30:54.296
You can wait here.

403
00:30:55.866 --> 00:30:58.235
I don't know when Mr. Park will come.

404
00:31:00.136 --> 00:31:01.836
I'm sure he'll come before he gets fired.

405
00:31:02.566 --> 00:31:03.636
Right.

406
00:31:13.346 --> 00:31:14.415
(Resignation Letter: Shim Jung Hwa, The Baby Editing Department)

407
00:31:14.415 --> 00:31:17.255
(I can no longer work here because I need to focus on childcare.)

408
00:31:33.066 --> 00:31:35.505
I never told you to quit.

409
00:31:35.965 --> 00:31:38.235
I only suggested you take a break.

410
00:31:38.806 --> 00:31:41.076
It was pretty much the same thing as telling me to quit.

411
00:31:41.646 --> 00:31:44.646
And it's time that I quit anyway.

412
00:31:44.745 --> 00:31:46.886
I need to leave in order for the others to get promoted.

413
00:31:50.856 --> 00:31:53.286
I can't ask you to stay because your baby is sick.

414
00:31:54.156 --> 00:31:57.925
Then can you at least work until we hire someone new?

415
00:31:58.025 --> 00:32:01.265
No, I'm going to hand over all my work to Ms. Jang...

416
00:32:01.265 --> 00:32:02.525
and quit right away.

417
00:32:06.165 --> 00:32:08.806
Just because you quit...

418
00:32:09.265 --> 00:32:12.005
doesn't mean Ms. Jang will become the editor-in-chief.

419
00:32:12.336 --> 00:32:13.705
She'll just be the acting editor-in-chief.

420
00:32:23.056 --> 00:32:24.455
I also care...

421
00:32:25.656 --> 00:32:27.656
about Ms. Jang.

422
00:32:27.925 --> 00:32:31.296
But the chairman is very angry with her,

423
00:32:31.296 --> 00:32:32.826
so she won't be able to take your place.

424
00:32:33.925 --> 00:32:36.896
So just keep working here until we find...

425
00:32:36.896 --> 00:32:38.536
someone to replace you.

426
00:32:39.435 --> 00:32:40.505
Okay.

427
00:32:43.836 --> 00:32:45.275
Have a good day.

428
00:32:48.445 --> 00:32:49.606
Hey, Seung Tae.

429
00:32:52.616 --> 00:32:54.786
Either be a loyal dog to the chairman...

430
00:32:55.415 --> 00:32:58.316
or be a good boss who takes good care of his subordinates.

431
00:32:59.955 --> 00:33:01.626
If you want to do both, then be good at it.

432
00:33:03.356 --> 00:33:04.796
Have a good day.

433
00:33:23.215 --> 00:33:25.175
Hey, you're here.

434
00:33:25.515 --> 00:33:26.745
Why didn't you go home?

435
00:33:28.046 --> 00:33:30.715
I spent the entire day at Cheonwang.

436
00:33:31.015 --> 00:33:32.786
But I didn't get to meet Mr. Park.

437
00:33:33.126 --> 00:33:35.126
I didn't do much today, so I thought I'd get some work done.

438
00:33:37.356 --> 00:33:39.326
You just waited there all day?

439
00:33:40.096 --> 00:33:41.396
Did Mr. Kim tell you to do that?

440
00:33:41.765 --> 00:33:43.366
It's my job, so I should be the one to take care of it.

441
00:33:45.465 --> 00:33:46.665
Ms. Jang.

442
00:33:48.136 --> 00:33:49.636
I learned a lot from your column.

443
00:33:50.136 --> 00:33:52.136
There was nothing to learn from it.

444
00:33:52.536 --> 00:33:55.475
I learned that I should make sure to keep my private life private.

445
00:33:57.015 --> 00:33:59.116
And I realized that I need to act more bravely.

446
00:34:02.846 --> 00:34:05.415
I'm too young to judge you.

447
00:34:05.755 --> 00:34:08.786
But I do think you're incredible.

448
00:34:09.856 --> 00:34:11.025
In what way?

449
00:34:12.126 --> 00:34:15.495
To be honest, I don't even know what I want.

450
00:34:16.126 --> 00:34:17.435
So I'm still very lost.

451
00:34:18.036 --> 00:34:21.366
But on the other hand, you know exactly...

452
00:34:21.366 --> 00:34:24.175
what you want, and that's how you live your life.

453
00:34:24.606 --> 00:34:27.705
To some people, it might seem unusual.

454
00:34:27.705 --> 00:34:30.415
And some people might be scared to take action like you.

455
00:34:32.215 --> 00:34:33.316
So I think you're amazing.

456
00:34:36.015 --> 00:34:39.386
Eu Ddeum, you understand me?

457
00:34:40.455 --> 00:34:42.855
Yes, what you want isn't illegal.

458
00:34:48.125 --> 00:34:49.996
- Goodbye. - See you.

459
00:34:49.996 --> 00:34:51.065
Bye.

460
00:34:58.036 --> 00:34:59.906
(Advertising Department, Choi Kang Eu Ddeum)

461
00:35:05.516 --> 00:35:06.746
It's due tomorrow.

462
00:35:07.315 --> 00:35:09.485
- Ms. Choi, look. - What?

463
00:35:09.485 --> 00:35:10.786
Don't I look exactly like Chow Yun-fat?

464
00:35:11.085 --> 00:35:13.016
What? Whom?

465
00:35:13.755 --> 00:35:14.855
She must not know him.

466
00:35:16.186 --> 00:35:18.755
By the way, is Eu Ddeum not here yet?

467
00:35:18.925 --> 00:35:20.496
He went straight to Cheonwang.

468
00:35:20.795 --> 00:35:23.835
Mr. Park, the team leader, is really petty.

469
00:35:23.835 --> 00:35:24.835
If he's at a disadvantage,

470
00:35:24.835 --> 00:35:27.235
he never answers our calls or agrees to meet us.

471
00:35:28.005 --> 00:35:30.036
You sent Eu Ddeum to a place like that?

472
00:35:30.735 --> 00:35:32.636
Why? Was I not supposed to send him there?

473
00:35:33.445 --> 00:35:36.916
He won't be able to do anything. He'll just get kicked out.

474
00:35:38.675 --> 00:35:40.246
Chow Yun-fat, my foot.

475
00:35:41.645 --> 00:35:42.786
What's wrong with her?

476
00:35:47.686 --> 00:35:50.895
- Hey, Ms. Choi. - Are you going to stay there?

477
00:35:51.826 --> 00:35:53.395
I should wait. It's my job.

478
00:35:53.395 --> 00:35:55.326
Don't bother. Just come back.

479
00:35:56.366 --> 00:35:57.465
What's the matter?

480
00:35:58.465 --> 00:36:01.366
I need you to help me with some stuff.

481
00:36:01.565 --> 00:36:03.235
I'm piled with stuff to do.

482
00:36:03.235 --> 00:36:05.906
Anyway, there's tons of work, so just get over here.

483
00:36:12.576 --> 00:36:14.516
Who was that? Was it Eu Ddeum?

484
00:36:15.786 --> 00:36:18.585
Yes, he's still at Cheonwang.

485
00:36:18.855 --> 00:36:20.956
He's so naive. They're never going to meet him,

486
00:36:21.255 --> 00:36:22.755
but he's just waiting there.

487
00:36:24.425 --> 00:36:26.895
Why would he send Eu Ddeum to a place like that?

488
00:36:27.766 --> 00:36:30.496
Don't you think this is a bit too much?

489
00:36:32.036 --> 00:36:35.366
Yeon Ho, do we have the proposal for Cheonwang's company magazine?

490
00:36:36.005 --> 00:36:37.136
Just a second.

491
00:36:42.505 --> 00:36:43.545
Do you have a meeting here?

492
00:36:43.545 --> 00:36:44.875
We're scheduled to have a meeting here at 11am.

493
00:36:45.875 --> 00:36:47.246
No, you can use this place.

494
00:36:48.016 --> 00:36:49.085
I'll go.

495
00:36:52.255 --> 00:36:53.485
Sorry. Bye.

496
00:37:04.465 --> 00:37:06.636
Ms. Park sent us the proposal.

497
00:37:06.806 --> 00:37:08.565
There weren't any problems with it.

498
00:37:11.206 --> 00:37:12.275
Where...

499
00:37:20.416 --> 00:37:21.516
Eu Ddeum.

500
00:37:23.215 --> 00:37:27.386
What? Ms. Jang, what are you doing here?

501
00:37:29.625 --> 00:37:32.326
The problem is right there.

502
00:37:37.065 --> 00:37:39.065
Do you expect your subcontractors to do everything you ask...

503
00:37:39.065 --> 00:37:40.605
and get punished like this?

504
00:37:41.436 --> 00:37:43.706
No, he wasn't there getting punished.

505
00:37:43.706 --> 00:37:46.706
When you're a new recruit, you get intimidated by your boss,

506
00:37:46.706 --> 00:37:50.175
you chew over your mistakes, and you punish yourself...

507
00:37:50.445 --> 00:37:52.645
by wondering if you should just write a resignation letter.

508
00:37:53.076 --> 00:37:54.715
He's already having a hard time as it is.

509
00:37:54.985 --> 00:37:58.715
So the least you can do is to treat him with respect.

510
00:38:01.585 --> 00:38:02.656
I'm sorry.

511
00:38:03.085 --> 00:38:05.355
I should've been more considerate, but I was just so busy.

512
00:38:10.666 --> 00:38:11.735
Okay.

513
00:38:12.036 --> 00:38:15.036
Sir, you're giving us work because you trust us.

514
00:38:15.206 --> 00:38:18.436
Our company believes that we have a good relationship with Cheonwang.

515
00:38:18.906 --> 00:38:21.645
And I hope to continue that relationship with you guys.

516
00:38:24.516 --> 00:38:27.386
- I'll call Mr. Park for you. - Thank you.

517
00:38:29.715 --> 00:38:31.315
Sir, just a second.

518
00:38:34.255 --> 00:38:37.855
Hello, I'm Jang Ha Ri from The Baby.

519
00:38:38.496 --> 00:38:40.326
I'm here regarding the toothpaste.

520
00:38:40.666 --> 00:38:44.235
It seems like you're busy, so I'll just talk to the director.

521
00:38:44.295 --> 00:38:46.906
If not, I'll just talk to the chairman.

522
00:39:03.755 --> 00:39:05.315
Look at how successful you've become.

523
00:39:06.186 --> 00:39:07.386
Mr. Han!

524
00:39:08.485 --> 00:39:09.585
Mr. Han?

525
00:39:09.585 --> 00:39:11.795
- It's so nice to meet you. - I know.

526
00:39:11.956 --> 00:39:13.666
Does she have to say hello to him like that?

527
00:39:13.666 --> 00:39:15.925
- You made a lot of money. - Yes, a bit.

528
00:39:16.895 --> 00:39:18.235
- Have you been well? - Of course.

529
00:39:18.235 --> 00:39:19.996
I can't believe he's fine enough to smile.

530
00:39:20.366 --> 00:39:23.436
He couldn't even kiss me, but he seems fine with hugging her.

531
00:39:27.406 --> 00:39:30.815
I'm so nervous about making a comeback.

532
00:39:31.076 --> 00:39:33.746
I don't know if it's because you're a mom now,

533
00:39:33.746 --> 00:39:35.585
but you have a softer impression than before.

534
00:39:35.715 --> 00:39:36.886
- Really? - Yes.

535
00:39:37.485 --> 00:39:38.616
It's way better.

536
00:39:43.695 --> 00:39:45.355
Hey, I didn't see you there.

537
00:39:50.961 --> 00:39:52.461
Gosh, look who it is.

538
00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.631
I usually drink...

539
00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:58.301
fresh juice after meals, you see.

540
00:40:01.471 --> 00:40:04.080
This is Ms. Jang Ha Ri...

541
00:40:04.211 --> 00:40:06.341
from the magazine "The Baby". You probably know...

542
00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:09.051
- Kang Hyo Joo. - Right, Ms. Kang.

543
00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.450
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

544
00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.950
Mr. Han and I...

545
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:15.991
are good colleagues who are comfortable with each other.

546
00:40:15.991 --> 00:40:17.421
I'd love to feature you...

547
00:40:17.421 --> 00:40:19.520
- in our magazine sometime. - Sounds great.

548
00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.861
Right. Well, enjoy each other's company.

549
00:40:24.761 --> 00:40:26.560
She's the bubbly type.

550
00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.971
Yes, I can tell.

551
00:40:28.531 --> 00:40:31.270
That being said, I was recently offered a photoshoot,

552
00:40:32.171 --> 00:40:33.640
but it's too heavy of a burden.

553
00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:36.310
I've had two kids, so people will say...

554
00:40:36.571 --> 00:40:38.211
that my body isn't what it used to be...

555
00:40:38.211 --> 00:40:40.111
and that I look older now.

556
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:42.580
- It'll kill me. - Come on.

557
00:40:43.111 --> 00:40:44.651
There's no need to feel pressured.

558
00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:47.790
You were and still are a top celebrity.

559
00:41:03.801 --> 00:41:05.100
It's why...

560
00:41:08.671 --> 00:41:12.310
I want you to take my photos for me.

561
00:41:12.881 --> 00:41:16.881
It'd be my honor to take your photos.

562
00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.850
You know how fond of you I am.

563
00:41:20.721 --> 00:41:22.350
Please take my photos for me.

564
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:25.091
I really want you to.

565
00:41:25.191 --> 00:41:27.790
You've known me for years, so you're aware...

566
00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:31.000
of my best angles and how to show off my figure.

567
00:41:31.401 --> 00:41:34.031
You're pretty no matter which angle the camera shoots you from.

568
00:41:37.401 --> 00:41:39.540
You and Ms. Kang seem close.

569
00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.140
I've been taking her photos since she debuted,

570
00:41:42.711 --> 00:41:44.241
so yes.

571
00:41:44.941 --> 00:41:47.680
You must have high standards from working with top celebrities.

572
00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:52.721
Actually, my type is someone who's super pretty,

573
00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:55.620
slightly on the petite side,

574
00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:58.321
and silly in the most hilarious way.

575
00:41:58.321 --> 00:42:00.761
Pretty? Super pretty?

576
00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:02.560
And silly?

577
00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.801
There's no need to say everything...

578
00:42:06.801 --> 00:42:09.600
that obviously doesn't describe me.

579
00:42:10.171 --> 00:42:12.140
I get that you don't see me as your type,

580
00:42:12.341 --> 00:42:13.841
but my feelings...

581
00:42:13.941 --> 00:42:15.870
were as brief and light...

582
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:18.310
as a feather floating away in the wind...

583
00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.080
anyway.

584
00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:22.450
See? Even though I'm facing you,

585
00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:24.381
I don't feel anything.

586
00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.620
I couldn't be more at ease.

587
00:42:27.151 --> 00:42:28.491
Well, I'm not.

588
00:42:30.691 --> 00:42:32.461
I'm only trying to be comfortable around you...

589
00:42:32.961 --> 00:42:34.531
because I need to be.

590
00:42:37.631 --> 00:42:39.461
It seems like you don't even want to work with me,

591
00:42:41.031 --> 00:42:43.640
so I'll only work with Sang Hee from now on.

592
00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:54.350
It's because I still want to be around you.

593
00:43:01.691 --> 00:43:05.620
(Potential sperm donor no. 3: Han I Sang)

594
00:43:11.401 --> 00:43:12.461
Ms. Jang.

595
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:17.241
Eu Ddeum, let's make sure...

596
00:43:17.241 --> 00:43:19.741
that the toothpaste is all used in three months.

597
00:43:19.941 --> 00:43:21.540
The deadline on the advertisement page...

598
00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:22.540
was asked to be moved up.

599
00:43:22.611 --> 00:43:23.941
When was that again?

600
00:43:31.881 --> 00:43:33.281
Why are you looking at me like that?

601
00:43:35.651 --> 00:43:38.221
You see, I took some time...

602
00:43:38.221 --> 00:43:40.531
to think long and hard about this.

603
00:43:41.261 --> 00:43:44.261
Your column was enough to make you understand your situation.

604
00:43:44.761 --> 00:43:47.230
I couldn't possibly admire you more...

605
00:43:47.301 --> 00:43:49.801
and I know I'm the one you want.

606
00:43:53.810 --> 00:43:55.011
You can have it.

607
00:43:56.571 --> 00:43:57.680
What?

608
00:43:58.841 --> 00:44:01.551
You became known as Sperm Lady because of it.

609
00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:05.450
It wouldn't have happened had you been eligible for a sperm donor.

610
00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:09.551
Of course, you need sperms to get pregnant.

611
00:44:10.051 --> 00:44:13.290
After seeing you get humiliated,

612
00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:14.761
I couldn't sit by and watch...

613
00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:17.560
when I have all this sperm to offer.

614
00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.031
I don't think we need to talk about this anymore.

615
00:44:21.631 --> 00:44:22.700
You're embarrassed, I see.

616
00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:25.341
How about this then? Instead of sperm,

617
00:44:25.341 --> 00:44:27.711
we'll call it "spam" or "swarm".

618
00:44:28.071 --> 00:44:30.881
That's even worse, so let's not talk about it.

619
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:36.111
Why not? You said you were running out of time.

620
00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.381
Still, this doesn't seem right.

621
00:44:38.881 --> 00:44:41.551
But... Ms. Jang?

622
00:45:06.241 --> 00:45:07.250
(Potential sperm donor no. 3: Han I Sang)

623
00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:37.580
It's what I said!

624
00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.640
- You're always on my case. - Whatever.

625
00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:41.551
Unbelievable. Ha Ri!

626
00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:45.781
What are you doing here?

627
00:45:45.821 --> 00:45:47.691
- Nothing. - Here's your coffee.

628
00:45:47.721 --> 00:45:49.091
Thanks.

629
00:45:54.930 --> 00:45:57.131
Me? I thought so too.

630
00:45:57.401 --> 00:45:59.531
Was I the only one who didn't know?

631
00:45:59.761 --> 00:46:00.870
No way.

632
00:46:19.221 --> 00:46:20.390
Dr. Yoon.

633
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:22.290
Yes?

634
00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:23.861
I'll call it a day then.

635
00:46:24.091 --> 00:46:25.560
Sure. You did great today.

636
00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:27.660
A plant came in for you.

637
00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:35.171
(From cardiothoracic surgeon Seo Jeong Won)

638
00:46:38.971 --> 00:46:40.000
It's me.

639
00:46:41.071 --> 00:46:43.211
Where's Do Ah? I'll take her home with me.

640
00:46:43.441 --> 00:46:45.611
I already told daycare that I'd be picking her up late.

641
00:46:45.611 --> 00:46:48.011
I'll close up and head over there.

642
00:46:50.211 --> 00:46:51.321
Seo Jeong Won?

643
00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.091
Do Ah's mom?

644
00:46:54.921 --> 00:46:58.790
Auntie, must I pay to have this thrown out?

645
00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:01.230
Why would you throw out something expensive?

646
00:47:02.961 --> 00:47:06.060
I'll still know who sent it even if you take it off.

647
00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.131
She sent you this to torture you.

648
00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:11.540
She wants you to think of her.

649
00:47:11.741 --> 00:47:13.370
I should get rid of it...

650
00:47:14.341 --> 00:47:15.910
so that she never does anything like this again.

651
00:47:15.941 --> 00:47:18.011
Just look at her.

652
00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:20.850
Being pretty and smart only made her a sly minx.

653
00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:33.890
Hold on a second. Did Young Ok...

654
00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:36.290
open her store today?

655
00:47:46.401 --> 00:47:49.770
Shouldn't we book a venue for Do Ah's first birthday party?

656
00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.680
The Crimton Hotel has a great convention hall.

657
00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:55.551
Let's keep the invitations to about 100 guests.

658
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:57.921
Are your parents coming in from the US?

659
00:47:57.921 --> 00:47:59.450
Aren't we divorced?

660
00:48:00.691 --> 00:48:03.551
We ended things with me accepting child support.

661
00:48:04.491 --> 00:48:07.160
Is this because you don't want to pay up?

662
00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.491
Then don't.

663
00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:10.761
Take the child support...

664
00:48:10.761 --> 00:48:12.100
and let me throw her a birthday party too.

665
00:48:13.361 --> 00:48:14.700
I'm her mother, aren't I?

666
00:48:19.901 --> 00:48:21.770
Do Ah goes to daycare.

667
00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:26.381
She started less than a month ago and she even has friends.

668
00:48:26.741 --> 00:48:29.711
She eats well too and can gobble down a whole bowl...

669
00:48:29.711 --> 00:48:31.151
of radish soup with rice.

670
00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:33.651
She wasn't able to at first,

671
00:48:35.551 --> 00:48:37.991
but now she can say something close to "Dad".

672
00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:44.200
She can't say "Mom" though.

673
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.671
Shouldn't you ask how she's doing first?

674
00:48:55.611 --> 00:48:56.810
If you're truly her mom, I mean.

675
00:48:58.741 --> 00:49:00.680
"Is she sick?"

676
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:02.480
"Has she been eating well?"

677
00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.250
"Does she sleep well at night?"

678
00:49:05.321 --> 00:49:07.321
That's what you should ask first.

679
00:49:12.361 --> 00:49:13.721
You're not Do Ah's mom.

680
00:49:14.691 --> 00:49:16.060
I'll plan her first birthday party.

681
00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:17.660
I'm fine now.

682
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:20.131
I came because I want to get along again.

683
00:49:21.131 --> 00:49:22.971
I never stopped loving you.

684
00:49:29.211 --> 00:49:31.580
You've never once not been selfish.

685
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.281
I was the idiot...

686
00:49:38.881 --> 00:49:41.091
for dumping Ha Ri to choose you.

687
00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:46.560
Is she getting between us?

688
00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:47.631
No.

689
00:49:50.801 --> 00:49:51.930
You got...

690
00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.671
between Ha Ri and me.

691
00:50:14.350 --> 00:50:17.091
There. That's refreshing, isn't it?

692
00:50:17.591 --> 00:50:18.691
Are you done?

693
00:50:18.691 --> 00:50:20.321
Give Do Ah to me, and eat.

694
00:50:20.321 --> 00:50:22.660
It's okay. I'm still full from lunch.

695
00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.301
- You eat. - Eat at least a little bit.

696
00:50:25.301 --> 00:50:27.471
I'm okay. I'm going to rest.

697
00:50:29.531 --> 00:50:32.270
Okay. Let's go night-night.

698
00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.511
Even if they hate each other,

699
00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.750
a baby should receive love from her mom.

700
00:50:46.781 --> 00:50:47.850
Okay.

701
00:50:52.921 --> 00:50:56.091
You look so pretty after washing up, Do Ah.

702
00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:58.901
From whom did you get your pretty looks?

703
00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:01.131
What? Daddy?

704
00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:07.140
You're even going to daycare.

705
00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:08.941
Thank you for growing up well...

706
00:51:09.341 --> 00:51:10.881
although you're living with a dad like me.

707
00:51:13.111 --> 00:51:16.011
We felt hopeless when we were all we had for each other.

708
00:51:16.111 --> 00:51:17.211
Right?

709
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:20.750
But you learned how you just survive somehow, right?

710
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:23.651
So...

711
00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:27.461
Daddy, Grandma, and Auntie Ha Ri...

712
00:51:28.261 --> 00:51:29.890
will love you even more.

713
00:51:32.131 --> 00:51:33.901
You'll be fine without a mom.

714
00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:37.441
Let's do the best we can...

715
00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:40.140
just the two of us, okay?

716
00:51:44.941 --> 00:51:46.040
Okay?

717
00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:54.020
Hello.

718
00:51:55.421 --> 00:51:58.591
I'm here about the size for "Book and Book".

719
00:51:58.591 --> 00:52:00.991
May I look at Ms. Jang's desk?

720
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:03.290
- Sure, go ahead. - Thank you.

721
00:52:08.901 --> 00:52:10.841
Did the company decide on the size?

722
00:52:10.941 --> 00:52:12.741
Rather than the previous size?

723
00:52:12.841 --> 00:52:15.971
Yes. They said that they told Ms. Jang, but I don't see it.

724
00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:20.310
Check her journal there.

725
00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:21.651
Where is it?

726
00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:28.651
She emailed it to me too.

727
00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:30.390
I'll send it to you.

728
00:52:32.761 --> 00:52:33.821
Sure.

729
00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:36.691
Have a nice day.

730
00:52:37.131 --> 00:52:38.200
Hey.

731
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:41.901
Have a nice day.

732
00:52:47.071 --> 00:52:49.741
Guys, I have some good news.

733
00:52:50.841 --> 00:52:53.211
Our regular readership went up by 0.1 percent.

734
00:52:53.611 --> 00:52:55.250
It's probably the effect of Ms. Jang's column.

735
00:52:58.551 --> 00:52:59.721
I have even better news.

736
00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:01.350
What is it?

737
00:53:01.651 --> 00:53:04.091
Are we getting a special incentive?

738
00:53:04.261 --> 00:53:05.861
Yes, I'll give you a reward.

739
00:53:06.861 --> 00:53:08.131
I'm quitting.

740
00:53:15.401 --> 00:53:16.671
I'm going home.

741
00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:21.270
Good night.

742
00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:28.180
The words are flowing out.

743
00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:29.381
(Emergency Room Spicy Rice Cakes)

744
00:53:29.381 --> 00:53:31.321
It'll be too spicy for you.

745
00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:35.620
- Whatever. I can handle it. - Sure.

746
00:53:38.191 --> 00:53:40.290
- Hey. - Hello.

747
00:53:45.531 --> 00:53:47.730
Were you craving something spicy too?

748
00:53:47.830 --> 00:53:49.500
I love spicy rice cakes.

749
00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:50.901
Why are you craving spicy food?

750
00:53:50.901 --> 00:53:52.971
Who stressed you out?

751
00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:55.671
Ms. Shim is resigning.

752
00:53:56.211 --> 00:53:57.270
Why?

753
00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.051
Ms. Shim is loyal.

754
00:54:09.421 --> 00:54:11.020
It was only you guys who didn't know.

755
00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:14.120
You knew because she was nice only to you.

756
00:54:14.491 --> 00:54:16.230
I thought she hated only you.

757
00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:18.430
Ha Ri, you must be upset.

758
00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.341
Goodness. You're beet red.

759
00:54:24.441 --> 00:54:26.600
This is perfect. It's deliciously spicy.

760
00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:29.841
Gosh. What will you do once she's gone?

761
00:54:29.841 --> 00:54:31.241
- Enjoy. - Bye.

762
00:54:31.341 --> 00:54:32.711
- Good night. - Good night.

763
00:54:33.381 --> 00:54:35.781
- It's so spicy. - Come on.

764
00:54:36.781 --> 00:54:39.350
- If you can't handle it... - It's hot.

765
00:54:40.281 --> 00:54:41.850
An order of the extra spicy rice cakes, please.

766
00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:43.250
Please cancel that order.

767
00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.191
- Let's eat it less spicy. - Okay.

768
00:54:53.261 --> 00:54:57.000
I uploaded the b-cuts of yesterday's baby models.

769
00:54:57.131 --> 00:54:58.700
Thank you.

770
00:54:58.801 --> 00:55:02.241
That's in exchange for payment. The moms will love it.

771
00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:07.310
It's so good.

772
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:10.151
- Good night. - Good night.

773
00:55:10.151 --> 00:55:11.551
Good night.

774
00:55:17.091 --> 00:55:18.160
It's so hot.

775
00:55:20.261 --> 00:55:21.691
What's going on? Where is she going?

776
00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:23.830
Goodness.

777
00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:28.671
I Sang.

778
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:33.600
Bye...

779
00:55:44.308 --> 00:55:45.819
What are you trying to pull?

780
00:55:48.348 --> 00:55:49.518
I drew the line.

781
00:55:51.018 --> 00:55:52.319
You shouldn't cross it.

782
00:55:54.529 --> 00:55:57.459
Showing how you feel but not coming to me hurts more.

783
00:56:01.129 --> 00:56:02.768
Don't confuse me anymore.

784
00:56:06.569 --> 00:56:08.138
It didn't mean nothing to me.

785
00:56:10.238 --> 00:56:11.709
It wasn't easy to stop.

786
00:56:13.379 --> 00:56:14.479
I was...

787
00:56:16.509 --> 00:56:17.578
rash.

788
00:56:20.118 --> 00:56:21.689
Because there is no "next" for us?

789
00:56:27.959 --> 00:56:29.328
I decided it wasn't right...

790
00:56:30.359 --> 00:56:31.658
because of my own problem.

791
00:56:32.029 --> 00:56:35.928
So I wish you wouldn't think it was your problem.

792
00:56:36.499 --> 00:56:37.899
Since I can't take responsibility,

793
00:56:39.899 --> 00:56:41.468
I thought it would be more considerate...

794
00:56:41.908 --> 00:56:44.979
and thoughtful not to want more.

795
00:56:48.078 --> 00:56:49.948
That's just how little you felt for me.

796
00:56:51.279 --> 00:56:52.948
If it's better to quit cold turkey,

797
00:56:54.319 --> 00:56:55.448
I'll try that.

798
00:56:57.549 --> 00:56:58.718
I'm sorry.

799
00:57:31.718 --> 00:57:33.419
If it's better to quit cold turkey,

800
00:57:34.689 --> 00:57:35.828
I'll try that.

801
00:57:39.328 --> 00:57:41.328
Ha Ri, did you find them all?

802
00:57:41.799 --> 00:57:43.268
Yes, almost.

803
00:57:45.198 --> 00:57:48.908
Who knew Ms. Shim would quit because of her baby?

804
00:57:49.538 --> 00:57:52.209
I don't think I could handle it if my baby were sick.

805
00:57:52.379 --> 00:57:54.678
No matter how you look at it, I was smart not to have kids.

806
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:58.018
- Yeon Ho? - Yes?

807
00:57:58.348 --> 00:58:01.819
Do you think you'll never change your mind?

808
00:58:02.288 --> 00:58:05.189
We're living happy, fun lives, just the two of us.

809
00:58:05.388 --> 00:58:07.988
I don't want to sacrifice my life for a baby.

810
00:58:08.229 --> 00:58:10.259
But realistically speaking, money is the biggest problem.

811
00:58:11.129 --> 00:58:13.959
We need to pay for their tuition until they graduate college,

812
00:58:14.029 --> 00:58:15.698
pay for their wedding,

813
00:58:15.768 --> 00:58:19.098
and we'll grow old while trying to help them buy a house.

814
00:58:19.138 --> 00:58:21.709
Then we'll never be able to enjoy our lives.

815
00:58:22.808 --> 00:58:24.468
We both don't want children,

816
00:58:24.468 --> 00:58:27.379
so telling us to have a baby is the same thing as verbal violence.

817
00:58:29.509 --> 00:58:32.218
I guess you're right. You do have a point.

818
00:58:34.749 --> 00:58:36.089
How is your project going?

819
00:58:36.149 --> 00:58:38.058
Why don't you just marry that guy?

820
00:58:38.058 --> 00:58:40.018
That's nonsense.

821
00:58:43.428 --> 00:58:45.698
Now that he's offering to give it to me, it's kind of scary.

822
00:58:45.859 --> 00:58:47.129
I also feel a bit sorry.

823
00:58:48.198 --> 00:58:49.899
I don't know if it's because he's young,

824
00:58:51.029 --> 00:58:53.268
but he's so slow-witted. He's just always so happy.

825
00:58:53.999 --> 00:58:56.009
What? Are you talking about Eu Ddeum?

826
00:58:58.779 --> 00:59:02.448
You're so quick-witted. Make sure you keep it a secret.

827
00:59:03.479 --> 00:59:06.419
I thought it was Mr. Han.

828
00:59:06.919 --> 00:59:08.288
No, it's not him.

829
00:59:08.988 --> 00:59:10.618
Eu Ddeum is too young.

830
00:59:10.788 --> 00:59:12.959
I'm just too old.

831
00:59:13.319 --> 00:59:16.058
I never knew I'd be so sad about my age.

832
00:59:17.428 --> 00:59:20.259
I don't know why I feel this way anymore.

833
00:59:21.229 --> 00:59:23.428
I don't know what to say to Eu Ddeum either.

834
00:59:30.439 --> 00:59:31.578
What?

835
00:59:33.339 --> 00:59:35.348
What am I going to do?

836
00:59:40.279 --> 00:59:41.419
Okay.

837
00:59:44.488 --> 00:59:45.518
Cheers.

838
00:59:45.618 --> 00:59:47.259
I get what you mean.

839
00:59:48.359 --> 00:59:50.928
My gosh, this tastes great.

840
00:59:50.928 --> 00:59:52.629
It's been ages since we drank.

841
00:59:53.759 --> 00:59:54.968
- Cheers. - It's delicious.

842
00:59:56.169 --> 00:59:58.138
We haven't gathered in ages.

843
00:59:59.799 --> 01:00:01.868
Attention, everyone.

844
01:00:02.038 --> 01:00:04.569
Do you all know why we're here?

845
01:00:04.678 --> 01:00:06.538
- To throw a farewell party... - For Ms. Shim!

846
01:00:09.049 --> 01:00:10.948
Yes, you guys are so thrilled.

847
01:00:10.948 --> 01:00:14.018
You must feel really upset to see how thrilled they are.

848
01:00:14.419 --> 01:00:16.288
Let's hear her say her last words before she leaves.

849
01:00:16.988 --> 01:00:18.158
Do you want me to take back my resignation letter?

850
01:00:18.359 --> 01:00:20.058
We'll skip that. Okay then.

851
01:00:20.319 --> 01:00:22.589
We prepared a huge gift for you...

852
01:00:22.589 --> 01:00:25.129
to wish you a happy farewell.

853
01:00:25.229 --> 01:00:27.759
Okay, bring the gift.

854
01:00:30.029 --> 01:00:31.268
Go and get it.

855
01:00:31.569 --> 01:00:33.368
- Go on. - Come on, Ms. Shim.

856
01:00:33.439 --> 01:00:34.768
- Gosh, do I have to? - Go on.

857
01:00:35.768 --> 01:00:36.768
Come on.

858
01:00:57.259 --> 01:01:00.629
We gathered all the articles you wrote.

859
01:01:01.058 --> 01:01:03.399
You can use it as a portfolio for your next job interview.

860
01:01:04.839 --> 01:01:06.169
Thank you.

861
01:01:07.169 --> 01:01:09.538
What's with the mood?

862
01:01:09.538 --> 01:01:10.868
Sing.

863
01:01:11.339 --> 01:01:13.979
- Sing. - Sing.

864
01:01:15.049 --> 01:01:17.408
That's enough.

865
01:01:19.678 --> 01:01:21.649
We don't get to do this that often.

866
01:01:22.118 --> 01:01:23.348
My goodness.

867
01:01:23.348 --> 01:01:24.488
Drink up.

868
01:01:25.359 --> 01:01:27.218
Let's ask I Sang.

869
01:01:27.218 --> 01:01:28.459
Okay, great.

870
01:01:28.459 --> 01:01:30.529
- Let's drink. - Here.

871
01:01:30.529 --> 01:01:32.058
Let's start today.

872
01:01:32.129 --> 01:01:33.558
Gosh, stop it.

873
01:01:33.859 --> 01:01:35.098
You need to pull it out.

874
01:01:36.529 --> 01:01:37.768
I won't go.

875
01:01:38.098 --> 01:01:39.968
Whoever goes home first will be considered a traitor.

876
01:01:39.968 --> 01:01:41.268
Let's go to a karaoke room.

877
01:01:41.268 --> 01:01:43.709
No, I can't sing.

878
01:01:43.939 --> 01:01:45.939
My gosh, that's enough.

879
01:01:46.709 --> 01:01:47.839
Stop.

880
01:01:49.049 --> 01:01:50.549
Let's go home after this.

881
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:53.218
Gosh, no way.

882
01:01:54.678 --> 01:01:56.189
This is enough.

883
01:01:56.189 --> 01:01:57.788
Let's just call it a day.

884
01:01:57.788 --> 01:01:59.319
Don't even think of going home.

885
01:02:06.658 --> 01:02:08.529
I knew you'd be here.

886
01:02:08.529 --> 01:02:10.968
Why are you packing your stuff in the middle of a farewell party?

887
01:02:12.198 --> 01:02:13.598
Because I don't want to come to work tomorrow.

888
01:02:13.598 --> 01:02:16.138
You're not going to say goodbye just because you're embarrassed?

889
01:02:17.069 --> 01:02:20.038
You should come tomorrow. Let's eat lunch together.

890
01:02:20.738 --> 01:02:22.408
And let us see you off.

891
01:02:22.408 --> 01:02:23.879
Gosh, I can't be bothered.

892
01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:26.718
Just go take care of the others. They're all drunk.

893
01:02:26.848 --> 01:02:29.788
No, I'm going to take care of you.

894
01:02:32.419 --> 01:02:33.459
You're too nice.

895
01:02:33.459 --> 01:02:35.788
Don't be kind to everyone once you become the editor-in-chief.

896
01:02:35.788 --> 01:02:37.328
You need to be harsh whenever it's necessary.

897
01:02:37.328 --> 01:02:38.859
I wonder if they'll ever give me that position.

898
01:02:39.299 --> 01:02:42.468
If they don't, let me know. I'll come back with my baby.

899
01:02:43.098 --> 01:02:44.598
It feels like you really mean it.

900
01:02:47.868 --> 01:02:49.238
- Aren't you coming? - Okay.

901
01:02:53.808 --> 01:02:55.078
Wait for me.

902
01:02:55.249 --> 01:02:56.509
Hurry up.

903
01:03:02.819 --> 01:03:04.419
Are you really going to leave?

904
01:03:04.749 --> 01:03:08.058
You should at least say goodbye. It's your last time.

905
01:03:08.259 --> 01:03:10.388
And do what? Hug everyone and cry?

906
01:03:11.158 --> 01:03:13.198
It'll be embarrassing when we meet again.

907
01:03:13.529 --> 01:03:17.129
You're right. It'll be really embarrassing.

908
01:03:20.598 --> 01:03:23.468
- My gosh, Ms. Shim. - Hey.

909
01:03:23.808 --> 01:03:25.279
I might hit you.

910
01:03:33.118 --> 01:03:34.779
Thank you for everything.

911
01:03:38.689 --> 01:03:41.558
Thank you so much.

912
01:03:46.029 --> 01:03:47.259
Me too.

913
01:03:48.629 --> 01:03:49.899
Thank you for everything.

914
01:03:52.768 --> 01:03:53.868
Did you call for a chauffeur service?

915
01:03:54.768 --> 01:03:55.839
- Yes. - My gosh.

916
01:03:56.939 --> 01:03:58.538
You're so harsh.

917
01:04:42.319 --> 01:04:44.618
My gosh, let's go.

918
01:04:45.158 --> 01:04:46.759
My goodness.

919
01:04:46.759 --> 01:04:49.058
- Let's go! - Come on!

920
01:04:49.259 --> 01:04:51.189
Let's drink some more!

921
01:04:51.629 --> 01:04:53.729
Come on! Let's go for a drink!

922
01:04:54.729 --> 01:04:55.729
Let's drink more!

923
01:04:56.629 --> 01:04:58.229
- Come on. - Let's go for a second round.

924
01:04:58.229 --> 01:04:59.499
Let's drink some more.

925
01:04:59.499 --> 01:05:00.499
Go home.

926
01:05:01.808 --> 01:05:03.308
Just go home.

927
01:05:03.468 --> 01:05:05.509
- Stop it. - Just get in the car.

928
01:05:05.509 --> 01:05:07.279
- My gosh. - You guys should go.

929
01:05:07.279 --> 01:05:09.348
I'll take care of them.

930
01:05:09.678 --> 01:05:11.209
- You should go. - Okay, bye!

931
01:05:11.209 --> 01:05:12.779
- Bye! - Bye!

932
01:05:13.848 --> 01:05:15.919
Let's go for another round!

933
01:05:16.319 --> 01:05:18.288
- Come on! - I need to get some rest.

934
01:05:18.819 --> 01:05:20.988
Are we going for a second round?

935
01:05:20.988 --> 01:05:22.488
Just get in the car.

936
01:05:23.388 --> 01:05:24.589
My gosh.

937
01:05:24.729 --> 01:05:26.799
- That's not the door. - My goodness.

938
01:05:26.799 --> 01:05:28.828
- Let's go. - Wait here.

939
01:05:28.828 --> 01:05:30.669
Sir, get in.

940
01:05:30.669 --> 01:05:32.399
- Get in the car. - Okay.

941
01:05:32.669 --> 01:05:34.638
Eu Ddeum, wake up.

942
01:05:34.638 --> 01:05:35.868
Get up.

943
01:05:35.868 --> 01:05:38.209
Ms. Jang, I need to talk to you.

944
01:05:39.138 --> 01:05:41.038
Eu Ddeum, wake up. Are you okay?

945
01:05:41.138 --> 01:05:43.149
Ms. Jang, I'll take care of him.

946
01:05:43.249 --> 01:05:44.549
You should go home.

947
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:46.749
No, I'll deal with him. You should go and help them.

948
01:05:46.749 --> 01:05:49.249
Sir! Help!

949
01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:51.859
I need to talk to Ms. Jang.

950
01:05:52.859 --> 01:05:55.689
- I'll take care of him. - Will you stop?

951
01:05:55.828 --> 01:05:57.959
Ms. Jang, you see...

952
01:05:58.089 --> 01:06:00.499
- I have something to confess. - Eu Ddeum.

953
01:06:00.658 --> 01:06:01.868
Do you recognize me?

954
01:06:03.129 --> 01:06:05.069
- You're my aunt. - What?

955
01:06:07.698 --> 01:06:08.839
You're Ms. Jang.

956
01:06:08.839 --> 01:06:11.808
Okay, stay focused. Come here. Let's go.

957
01:06:12.209 --> 01:06:13.678
- Okay, fine. - My gosh.

958
01:06:13.678 --> 01:06:15.749
- This isn't my car. - It's okay.

959
01:06:16.049 --> 01:06:18.178
Hey, I called a cab for him.

960
01:06:18.178 --> 01:06:20.178
We're going to wait over there. Make sure they go home, okay?

961
01:06:20.718 --> 01:06:22.649
- Okay. - Just get in the car.

962
01:06:22.848 --> 01:06:24.848
- No, I don't want to get in. - You need to get in the car.

963
01:06:24.848 --> 01:06:25.919
This car will take you to the second round.

964
01:06:26.089 --> 01:06:28.058
- But it's not my car. - There you go.

965
01:06:28.058 --> 01:06:30.058
- My car is white. - You're headed to the next round.

966
01:06:30.129 --> 01:06:32.399
- I have something to tell you. - Eu Ddeum.

967
01:06:32.399 --> 01:06:34.229
- Why won't you listen? - Sit down.

968
01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:35.768
My goodness.

969
01:06:39.268 --> 01:06:40.968
Gosh, this is crazy.

970
01:06:42.439 --> 01:06:43.569
Start driving.

971
01:06:56.719 --> 01:07:00.019
I know how you feel.

972
01:07:00.889 --> 01:07:03.688
You should've told me. You must've had such a hard time.

973
01:07:04.828 --> 01:07:06.799
I'm 12 years younger than you.

974
01:07:08.669 --> 01:07:10.629
Why do you keep aging?

975
01:07:11.028 --> 01:07:13.839
What? Has he lost his mind?

976
01:07:15.868 --> 01:07:18.009
You don't need to worry anymore.

977
01:07:18.009 --> 01:07:19.679
I've made up my mind.

978
01:07:20.379 --> 01:07:22.278
Why isn't the cab here yet?

979
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:24.509
That's not important right now.

980
01:07:31.249 --> 01:07:33.818
Gosh, I'm a complete mess.

981
01:07:35.188 --> 01:07:37.858
Is it because you want to impress me?

982
01:07:38.158 --> 01:07:39.228
My gosh.

983
01:07:50.469 --> 01:07:53.408
I also want to impress you, Ms. Jang.

984
01:07:54.278 --> 01:07:56.148
My goodness.

985
01:07:56.849 --> 01:07:58.078
What's taking the cab so long?

986
01:08:29.478 --> 01:08:31.608
(We thank Jeon Hye Bin for her special appearance.)

987
01:08:51.938 --> 01:08:54.738
(Oh My Baby)

988
01:08:54.969 --> 01:08:56.709
I think I have feelings for Ms. Jang.

989
01:08:56.839 --> 01:08:58.509
I was hoping to ask you two for advice.

990
01:08:58.509 --> 01:09:00.639
We're something like allies, right?

991
01:09:00.639 --> 01:09:02.148
No, we're not.

992
01:09:02.148 --> 01:09:03.679
Actually, go for it.

993
01:09:03.679 --> 01:09:06.948
How dare he kiss me without my permission.

994
01:09:06.948 --> 01:09:09.519
I haven't been kissed for 10 years!

995
01:09:10.988 --> 01:09:12.459
Why does it feel like it's been less than 10?

996
01:09:14.259 --> 01:09:15.459
I think I remember what happened.

997
01:09:16.389 --> 01:09:19.129
Do you actually see me in a romantic way?

998
01:09:19.898 --> 01:09:21.228
All I have for you...

999
01:09:22.669 --> 01:09:23.929
are romantic feelings.
