00:00:47.883 --> 00:00:49.043
Ha Ri.

2
00:01:07.093 --> 00:01:08.233
Let's...

3
00:01:31.692 --> 00:01:32.853
get married.

4
00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:39.393
Let's get married.

5
00:01:39.692 --> 00:01:42.263
Let's get married. Let's get married.

6
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:46.602
Ha Ri.

7
00:01:48.373 --> 00:01:49.373
Ha Ri.

8
00:01:50.373 --> 00:01:53.373
You don't need...

9
00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:55.643
to give me an answer right now.

10
00:01:55.643 --> 00:01:57.783
You can take your time to think about it...

11
00:01:57.813 --> 00:02:00.712
No, I'm... I'm just really taken aback.

12
00:02:02.123 --> 00:02:05.893
No, don't answer me right now.

13
00:02:06.093 --> 00:02:08.022
Okay, look.

14
00:02:08.293 --> 00:02:10.992
Think about all the good times we had...

15
00:02:10.992 --> 00:02:14.563
and try imagining a beautiful future.

16
00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:16.903
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:21.272 --> 00:02:23.143
What? You're sorry?

18
00:02:24.972 --> 00:02:26.112
Then...

19
00:02:26.772 --> 00:02:29.013
No, I'm sorry for hesitating.

20
00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:37.022
I think I got anxious...

21
00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:39.323
because I was too happy.

22
00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:44.062
We may be madly in love today.

23
00:02:44.893 --> 00:02:47.492
But tomorrow, we might break up and get heartbroken.

24
00:02:49.862 --> 00:02:52.302
It's not that I don't trust you.

25
00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:56.902
I'm just thinking about the worst that could happen.

26
00:03:02.383 --> 00:03:03.612
It's dumb, isn't it?

27
00:03:06.712 --> 00:03:08.182
If I keep worrying like this,

28
00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:11.592
I might miss out on all the happy moments.

29
00:03:21.062 --> 00:03:22.133
Okay.

30
00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:27.573
Let's get married.

31
00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:42.423
Then...

32
00:03:42.953 --> 00:03:44.353
give me your hand.

33
00:03:58.073 --> 00:03:59.073
Give me your hand.

34
00:04:22.263 --> 00:04:23.423
Let's...

35
00:04:27.492 --> 00:04:30.503
try our best to be happy.

36
00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:34.103
Yes, let's be happy.

37
00:05:10.803 --> 00:05:13.412
Guys, quickly wrap up the articles you're working on.

38
00:05:13.412 --> 00:05:14.573
I'd like to go home early.

39
00:05:15.042 --> 00:05:16.183
- Sure. - Got it.

(How to Deal with Babies' Fake Cries)

41
00:05:25.123 --> 00:05:26.522
- Hyo Joo. - Yes?

42
00:05:26.792 --> 00:05:29.462
Your piece regarding how to deal with fake cries.

43
00:05:31.193 --> 00:05:33.363
Are you saying that all children pretend to cry?

44
00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:35.232
Sorry?

45
00:05:36.363 --> 00:05:40.272
It's how children who can't talk yet communicate.

46
00:05:41.303 --> 00:05:44.042
Whenever they want something...

47
00:05:44.303 --> 00:05:46.472
or seek their parents' attention,

48
00:05:46.743 --> 00:05:49.582
they fake cry and that's what I wrote.

49
00:05:49.943 --> 00:05:52.613
Exactly. But sometimes, those cries are real.

50
00:05:54.053 --> 00:05:55.383
Add a section on how to differentiate them.

51
00:05:56.482 --> 00:05:57.582
Sure.

52
00:05:57.582 --> 00:05:58.722
Other than that,

53
00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:00.893
you did a great job.

54
00:06:14.073 --> 00:06:15.602
My gosh!

55
00:06:17.503 --> 00:06:20.113
Ms. Jang, the ring.

56
00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:24.482
Did he propose to you?

57
00:06:25.212 --> 00:06:26.613
Really? Let me see.

58
00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:28.782
What on earth.

59
00:06:29.123 --> 00:06:32.652
This small and pretty ring is heavier than I thought it'd be.

60
00:06:33.893 --> 00:06:36.393
I bet it's hard to type anything with that on your finger.

61
00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:39.993
Just know that we coached Mr. Han.

62
00:06:40.532 --> 00:06:43.532
If we hadn't, you could've received the worst proposal ever.

63
00:06:44.162 --> 00:06:45.832
I know and I'm grateful.

64
00:06:46.102 --> 00:06:48.342
Anyway, get back to work so that I can hurry home.

65
00:06:48.972 --> 00:06:50.243
Congratulations, Ha Ri.

66
00:06:51.542 --> 00:06:54.842
We'll be practicing a nuptial song to sing at your wedding.

67
00:06:54.982 --> 00:06:56.143
Count me out.

68
00:06:56.143 --> 00:06:57.613
Can I stick to just giving you a gift?

69
00:06:58.753 --> 00:07:00.183
You're not getting out of this.

70
00:07:00.183 --> 00:07:02.082
- We're a trio. - I don't want to.

71
00:07:02.082 --> 00:07:03.383
Shut it and get back to work.

72
00:07:04.253 --> 00:07:06.592
- You're super annoying. - So are you.

75
00:09:08.143 --> 00:09:11.912
Mom, I'll hire a caregiver, so come home already.

76
00:09:13.113 --> 00:09:16.182
All right, fine. Just don't worry about it too much.

77
00:09:19.493 --> 00:09:20.723
How can you want to do this?

78
00:09:21.022 --> 00:09:23.522
I hate that you're caring for him like this.

79
00:09:23.792 --> 00:09:26.763
Resent him instead and stay away from him.

80
00:09:27.062 --> 00:09:30.202
I heard you the first time, so please just stop.

81
00:09:35.003 --> 00:09:36.672
What if you get sick again because of this?

82
00:09:37.373 --> 00:09:39.572
Just stop what you're doing and come home.

83
00:09:45.782 --> 00:09:46.883
My gosh.

84
00:09:53.322 --> 00:09:56.692
Is your mom still by your father's sickbed?

85
00:09:57.493 --> 00:09:59.133
She just won't listen to me.

86
00:10:00.662 --> 00:10:03.363
I have work to get back to, so I'll catch you later. Sorry.

88
00:10:17.942 --> 00:10:19.312
You probably didn't have dinner yet.

89
00:10:20.753 --> 00:10:22.983
Gosh, you shouldn't have.

90
00:10:24.383 --> 00:10:26.292
- Thank you for this. - Right.

91
00:10:26.723 --> 00:10:28.393
Please, talk to me casually.

92
00:10:28.792 --> 00:10:32.333
I value formality and good manners...

93
00:10:32.863 --> 00:10:36.032
which is why I'm formal with even my juniors.

94
00:10:36.032 --> 00:10:38.932
This isn't me keeping my distance, so don't be upset about it.

95
00:10:39.603 --> 00:10:40.603
Sure.

96
00:10:41.233 --> 00:10:42.503
How's Ha Ri doing?

97
00:10:46.373 --> 00:10:49.143
She's deeply worried about you.

98
00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:51.542
I bet she's furious too.

99
00:10:52.782 --> 00:10:56.282
She believes that I had a rough life because of her dad.

100
00:10:58.493 --> 00:11:01.493
Since I'm here though, shouldn't I at least...

101
00:11:01.493 --> 00:11:04.422
- meet her father? - Ha Ri will be livid.

102
00:11:04.422 --> 00:11:06.792
She wouldn't want you to meet the man she loathes.

103
00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:08.333
Understood.

104
00:11:10.763 --> 00:11:12.032
Ha Ri's father...

105
00:11:13.133 --> 00:11:17.103
left us around the time she graduated elementary school.

106
00:11:18.873 --> 00:11:22.412
I didn't tell her knowing that she'd be hurt.

107
00:11:22.812 --> 00:11:25.282
- Is it good? - Yes.

108
00:11:26.912 --> 00:11:28.353
It's fine without your father, right?

109
00:11:33.692 --> 00:11:34.792
Sure.

110
00:11:36.763 --> 00:11:38.493
She knew I'd be upset too. Have this too.

111
00:11:38.963 --> 00:11:40.963
It's why she didn't bring up her father either.

112
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:44.902
She was just a kid. She probably missed him.

113
00:11:48.902 --> 00:11:50.042
It would've driven her crazy.

114
00:11:51.103 --> 00:11:54.243
No wonder she wanted to become a mother...

115
00:11:54.243 --> 00:11:55.942
and dreamed of having an ordinary family.

116
00:11:58.143 --> 00:11:59.952
That's not normal for a kid.

117
00:12:20.888 --> 00:12:22.528
I came by to see Ha Ri's mother.

118
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:24.888
You should head upstairs.

119
00:12:27.628 --> 00:12:28.728
Just a second.

120
00:12:33.368 --> 00:12:35.768
I'm only asking because I'm truly worried.

121
00:12:37.008 --> 00:12:38.238
I hope you don't get the wrong idea.

122
00:12:41.478 --> 00:12:42.608
Mr. Han,

123
00:12:43.449 --> 00:12:45.819
is there a chance for you to overcome your infertility?

124
00:12:48.449 --> 00:12:50.089
Those who believe pregnancies to be a miracle...

125
00:12:51.618 --> 00:12:53.819
will keep hoping even when there's only a one-percent chance.

126
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:57.028
It can happen to us.

127
00:12:58.699 --> 00:13:00.199
I truly wish...

128
00:13:01.598 --> 00:13:03.169
that it's not false hope.

129
00:13:04.598 --> 00:13:05.669
Thank you.

130
00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:20.118
It hurts.

131
00:13:21.378 --> 00:13:22.449
Gosh.

132
00:13:25.018 --> 00:13:26.719
Thank you, Ok Ran.

133
00:13:28.589 --> 00:13:30.258
I'm not doing this for your sake.

134
00:13:33.199 --> 00:13:34.628

135
00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:36.429

136
00:13:39.638 --> 00:13:41.039
How have you been, Mr. Jang?

137
00:13:41.268 --> 00:13:44.039
It's Jae Young. Do you remember me?

138
00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:45.608
- Hold on. - Gosh.

139
00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:46.909
Goodness.

140
00:13:48.978 --> 00:13:50.108
Gosh,

141
00:13:51.179 --> 00:13:52.978
- it's been a while. - It has.

142
00:13:54.079 --> 00:13:56.049
I see that you've aged a lot too.

143
00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:58.789
Of course, I'll be 40 soon.

144
00:14:02.858 --> 00:14:04.459
How did the surgery go?

145
00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:06.829
It went well.

146
00:14:07.059 --> 00:14:08.299
That's good.

147
00:14:09.368 --> 00:14:12.199
Auntie. I'll stay here tonight. You should go home.

148
00:14:12.368 --> 00:14:14.098
Why should you? It's okay.

149
00:14:14.569 --> 00:14:16.368
Go get some sleep.

150
00:14:16.469 --> 00:14:17.809
I'm off tomorrow.

151
00:14:19.939 --> 00:14:21.608
Where are you staying?

152
00:14:21.608 --> 00:14:24.508
I'm staying at a serviced apartment.

153
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:26.949
Do Ah's doing well too, so don't worry.

154
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:29.819
I need to go over soon to get her things.

155
00:14:30.488 --> 00:14:31.888
Who's with Do Ah now?

156
00:14:32.219 --> 00:14:35.888
Her mom is watching her for a few days.

157
00:14:41.159 --> 00:14:42.268
Auntie.

158
00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:44.898
Watch out for your blood pressure.

159
00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:46.398
Go home.

160
00:14:48.669 --> 00:14:49.709
Here.

161
00:14:52.579 --> 00:14:55.709
Okay. Thanks.

162
00:14:56.079 --> 00:14:57.079
My pleasure.

163
00:14:57.309 --> 00:14:58.449
Thanks, Jae Young.

164
00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:01.348
- Good night. - You too.

165
00:15:05.789 --> 00:15:06.888
Night.

166
00:15:18.098 --> 00:15:21.539
Have you and Ha Ri remained close?

167
00:15:21.909 --> 00:15:23.108
Of course.

168
00:15:24.309 --> 00:15:27.439
You haven't seen her since she was in grade school, right?

169
00:15:29.309 --> 00:15:30.608
That's right.

170
00:15:31.549 --> 00:15:33.719
She waited a really long time for you...

171
00:15:34.579 --> 00:15:36.719
during our grade school graduation.

172
00:15:37.988 --> 00:15:39.858
She thought you'd come with flowers.

173
00:15:41.459 --> 00:15:42.728
Flowers?

174
00:15:43.988 --> 00:15:45.028
Wait.

175
00:15:45.699 --> 00:15:48.299
Did I not go to her graduation?

176
00:15:56.768 --> 00:15:59.278
Ha Ri was the president of the volunteer club in middle school.

177
00:16:00.008 --> 00:16:02.079
She grumbled that it was a pain,

178
00:16:02.278 --> 00:16:04.679
but she was happy to be on the executive board,

179
00:16:05.348 --> 00:16:07.419
so she cleaned the school by herself.

180
00:16:08.148 --> 00:16:10.549
Gi Hoon broke his arm,

181
00:16:10.789 --> 00:16:12.758
so she carried his bag every day...

182
00:16:13.018 --> 00:16:14.589
and received a citizenship award.

183
00:16:15.789 --> 00:16:16.888
She did?

184
00:16:18.258 --> 00:16:19.598
Uncle.

185
00:16:20.858 --> 00:16:22.169
Ha Ri...

186
00:16:23.728 --> 00:16:26.069
grew up to be a kind, sweet person.

187
00:16:33.439 --> 00:16:36.848
What's your relationship with her?

188
00:16:41.818 --> 00:16:43.449
I don't have any relationship with her.

189
00:16:45.149 --> 00:16:48.219
We're just friends who are like siblings.

190
00:16:49.728 --> 00:16:52.199
Like friends, like siblings,

191
00:16:53.558 --> 00:16:55.258
we watch each other...

192
00:16:55.669 --> 00:16:57.998
go out with other people and fall madly in love with them.

193
00:17:11.548 --> 00:17:14.318
Why are you sitting in the middle of the street, wasted?

194
00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:16.189
It's cold here.

195
00:17:17.588 --> 00:17:18.788
Jae Young.

196
00:17:19.258 --> 00:17:21.189
I got dumped again.

197
00:17:21.558 --> 00:17:23.228
Did you get set up again already?

198
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:27.929
Why do I keep getting dumped?

199
00:17:29.728 --> 00:17:32.169
I feel like there isn't a single guy in the world...

200
00:17:32.169 --> 00:17:34.639
who likes me.

201
00:17:36.238 --> 00:17:37.639
I like you.

202
00:17:38.308 --> 00:17:39.508
That's annoying.

203
00:17:39.978 --> 00:17:42.179
Do you think that's comforting?

204
00:17:42.709 --> 00:17:44.709
What's the problem?

205
00:17:44.709 --> 00:17:46.318
Why am I not good enough?

206
00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:50.248
It's not that you're not good enough.

207
00:17:50.988 --> 00:17:53.159
But you're not a guy to me.

208
00:17:54.459 --> 00:17:56.988
If you and I date and then break up,

209
00:17:56.988 --> 00:17:59.228
I'd be losing a family member.

210
00:18:02.228 --> 00:18:04.768
I don't want to lose another family member.

211
00:18:11.639 --> 00:18:13.179
That's odd.

212
00:18:14.078 --> 00:18:16.278
How could a guy and a girl who are always together...

213
00:18:16.548 --> 00:18:18.478
not develop feelings for each other?

214
00:18:19.349 --> 00:18:20.818
That wouldn't be good.

215
00:18:21.879 --> 00:18:24.349
If I told her how I felt and was rejected...

216
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:27.619
What guy in the world could be friends with someone...

217
00:18:29.159 --> 00:18:30.389
he once loved?

218
00:18:45.609 --> 00:18:47.139
It feels like someone else's home.

219
00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:53.419
Do you want me to stay with you until you fall asleep?

220
00:18:56.719 --> 00:18:59.488
No, no. I won't do anything.

221
00:18:59.788 --> 00:19:03.129
I'm not a jerk who would bother my girlfriend...

222
00:19:04.058 --> 00:19:06.058
who's tired and depressed.

223
00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:10.699
You could be a little jerk.

224
00:19:14.998 --> 00:19:16.169
Do you want to eat something?

225
00:19:17.369 --> 00:19:19.338
Do you mean it?

226
00:19:19.508 --> 00:19:21.879
So... How much?

227
00:19:25.719 --> 00:19:28.149
She looks just like her mother when she was young.

228
00:19:29.189 --> 00:19:30.588
Are you a good cook?

229
00:19:31.349 --> 00:19:32.988
I make good instant noodles.

230
00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:35.219
So she can only make instant noodles.

231
00:19:36.988 --> 00:19:38.459
I cook well, so...

232
00:19:39.659 --> 00:19:41.298
I stink at cleaning too.

233
00:19:41.998 --> 00:19:44.169
We can get a nice vacuum cleaner.

234
00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:50.538
Ta-da. Doesn't it look good?

235
00:19:51.038 --> 00:19:53.939
It looks good. Let me.

236
00:19:55.609 --> 00:19:57.548
- A little. - A little?

237
00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:01.619
- This afternoon... - Yes?

238
00:20:02.689 --> 00:20:05.488
I met with your mother.

239
00:20:07.459 --> 00:20:08.859
Did you go to the hospital?

240
00:20:11.159 --> 00:20:12.228
I did.

241
00:20:13.498 --> 00:20:15.459
I didn't meet your father.

242
00:20:17.768 --> 00:20:18.899
I...

243
00:20:20.099 --> 00:20:23.068
guess I shouldn't introduce myself to your father, right?

244
00:20:26.008 --> 00:20:29.109
I wasn't embarrassed about not having a father,

245
00:20:29.649 --> 00:20:31.778
but I don't want you to meet him.

246
00:20:36.919 --> 00:20:39.919
Me too. I wasn't embarrassed...

247
00:20:39.919 --> 00:20:41.588
of my father,

248
00:20:42.488 --> 00:20:45.558
but I didn't want to be like him.

249
00:20:47.199 --> 00:20:49.429
He lived his entire life for the family.

250
00:20:50.268 --> 00:20:53.639
He was a great father who worked hard for the family until he died,

251
00:20:55.399 --> 00:20:57.139
but he had no life of his own.

252
00:20:59.808 --> 00:21:01.439
After my father passed away,

253
00:21:02.038 --> 00:21:05.078
I threw away his clothes and cleaned up his things...

254
00:21:06.518 --> 00:21:08.278
and two bags of trash were left.

255
00:21:09.919 --> 00:21:11.219
And...

256
00:21:13.219 --> 00:21:15.088
one box of his things.

257
00:21:17.288 --> 00:21:21.159
He was an aloof, quiet father who only worked...

258
00:21:21.558 --> 00:21:23.998
and lived 70 years on this earth.

259
00:21:25.528 --> 00:21:28.099
But his entire life fit into one box...

260
00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:30.538
and two trash bags.

261
00:21:39.478 --> 00:21:41.248
I'm sure it was for us,

262
00:21:42.248 --> 00:21:44.018
but why did he live like that?

263
00:21:45.919 --> 00:21:47.558
He didn't have to.

264
00:21:49.028 --> 00:21:50.159
It was so frustrating.

265
00:21:55.429 --> 00:21:57.798
My mom didn't tell me about my dad...

266
00:21:57.798 --> 00:22:01.099
because she didn't want me to hate him,

267
00:22:02.169 --> 00:22:04.369
but I heard her and my aunt talking...

268
00:22:06.078 --> 00:22:09.649
about the day my mom went to see my dad.

269
00:22:14.619 --> 00:22:16.318
Why did you come here?

270
00:22:18.048 --> 00:22:19.219
I need money.

271
00:22:21.919 --> 00:22:23.488
I don't have any money.

272
00:22:24.758 --> 00:22:25.859
Am I supposed to starve our kid?

273
00:22:26.199 --> 00:22:27.998
You need to at least pay for her tuition!

274
00:22:32.939 --> 00:22:33.998
Fine.

275
00:22:35.268 --> 00:22:37.038
Wait here.

276
00:22:38.909 --> 00:22:40.978
I remember that day when my mom was hurt...

277
00:22:43.849 --> 00:22:46.449
more than the day my dad left us.

278
00:22:48.649 --> 00:22:50.619
This is not my day.

279
00:22:52.048 --> 00:22:54.258
This hand is mine.

280
00:22:56.129 --> 00:22:58.189
Why is it so hot today?

281
00:22:59.859 --> 00:23:01.328
Are you Tae Seob's wife?

282
00:23:01.798 --> 00:23:04.699
Sweetie. You should wait inside.

283
00:23:05.298 --> 00:23:07.768
I'll make you a nice, cold cup of coffee.

284
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:10.969
What's her problem?

285
00:23:19.879 --> 00:23:23.018
The room is so smoky. Stop smoking so much.

286
00:23:23.018 --> 00:23:24.088
You all are smoking too much.

287
00:23:24.988 --> 00:23:28.219
Hey, your wife is waiting outside.

288
00:23:28.219 --> 00:23:30.288
Stop playing, and go outside.

289
00:23:30.588 --> 00:23:32.258
What are you waiting for? Deal.

290
00:23:32.258 --> 00:23:33.258
Did you win?

291
00:23:50.609 --> 00:23:53.119
Here. This is all I have.

292
00:23:55.649 --> 00:23:58.149
Take it, this is really all I have.

293
00:24:05.859 --> 00:24:07.129
I need money for her tuition.

294
00:24:07.558 --> 00:24:09.369
If I had more, I would've given it to you.

295
00:24:09.498 --> 00:24:11.199
This is killing me too, you know.

296
00:24:11.298 --> 00:24:14.199
All you ever want from me is money.

297
00:24:14.798 --> 00:24:16.808
I ran away from home because I couldn't breathe,

298
00:24:16.808 --> 00:24:18.439
but now you come here to ask me for money?

299
00:24:23.308 --> 00:24:25.209
Here. Take this and leave.

300
00:24:56.209 --> 00:24:59.879
She waited for him all day only to receive 78 dollars.

301
00:25:01.719 --> 00:25:03.318
And that made her feel so miserable.

302
00:25:06.058 --> 00:25:07.219
She wanted to throw the money at his face...

303
00:25:07.219 --> 00:25:09.159
and tell him that she didn't come to beg.

304
00:25:12.129 --> 00:25:13.328
But that was enough money...

305
00:25:15.328 --> 00:25:18.429
to last us three months without having to worry about food,

306
00:25:18.998 --> 00:25:20.099
so she just took it.

307
00:25:21.639 --> 00:25:24.068
She became furious every time she thought of that day,

308
00:25:26.478 --> 00:25:28.778
and it motivated her to work hard and make money.

309
00:25:30.109 --> 00:25:31.209
That's what my mom had to go through.

310
00:25:34.449 --> 00:25:36.248
And that's why I can't forgive my dad.

311
00:25:43.889 --> 00:25:45.629
I didn't want to tell you this.

312
00:25:49.599 --> 00:25:50.929
The noodles will get soggy.

313
00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:02.909
You mother...

314
00:26:03.849 --> 00:26:05.709
is very worried about you.

315
00:26:07.449 --> 00:26:08.518
She thinks...

316
00:26:09.588 --> 00:26:11.449
you got hurt because of your father.

317
00:26:15.359 --> 00:26:17.959
You should stop...

318
00:26:18.629 --> 00:26:22.328
dreaming of having a normal family because of what your father did.

319
00:26:23.268 --> 00:26:26.738
Instead, think of building a happy future with me.

320
00:26:31.169 --> 00:26:33.038
If you can't forgive your father,

321
00:26:33.808 --> 00:26:35.078
then don't forgive him.

322
00:26:38.078 --> 00:26:39.219
But...

323
00:26:40.419 --> 00:26:41.879
you should meet him.

324
00:26:42.889 --> 00:26:46.159
You might not hate him so much...

325
00:26:46.959 --> 00:26:48.419
if you meet him in person.

326
00:26:53.129 --> 00:26:54.328
Can we talk about something else?

327
00:26:55.058 --> 00:26:56.429
Something to switch my mood.

328
00:26:57.899 --> 00:26:58.969
Sure.

329
00:27:03.939 --> 00:27:05.038
Come here.

330
00:27:07.109 --> 00:27:08.879
You're so pretty right now.

331
00:27:09.548 --> 00:27:12.078
Let me be a jerk for a second.

332
00:27:13.679 --> 00:27:16.649
- My gosh, that's hot! It's so hot! - My goodness.

333
00:27:16.649 --> 00:27:18.288
Here. Oh, gosh.

334
00:27:18.288 --> 00:27:19.459
My goodness.

335
00:27:19.459 --> 00:27:21.119
You should go to the bathroom and wash your top.

336
00:27:21.119 --> 00:27:23.088
I'll see if there's another T-shirt you can wear.

337
00:27:23.088 --> 00:27:25.288
- Gosh, it's hot. - My goodness.

338
00:27:44.709 --> 00:27:45.909
I wonder if this will do.

339
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:47.548
Don't you need to change your underwear...

340
00:27:53.891 --> 00:27:54.990
I wonder if this will do.

341
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:56.391
Don't you need to change your underwear...

342
00:28:08.541 --> 00:28:10.170
Mom, we only had noodles.

343
00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:12.710
I know what's going on.

344
00:28:13.381 --> 00:28:14.680
That's what you young people say.

345
00:28:14.811 --> 00:28:16.680
No, Mom. It's not what you think.

346
00:28:22.081 --> 00:28:23.190
You were topless?

347
00:28:46.581 --> 00:28:47.680
Hey.

348
00:28:49.851 --> 00:28:51.210
I Sang is gone.

349
00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:53.551
I see.

350
00:28:54.651 --> 00:28:56.121
We did nothing.

351
00:28:58.591 --> 00:29:00.920
If you weren't going to do anything, why did you invite him over?

352
00:29:01.361 --> 00:29:04.690
Gosh, if you say it like that,

353
00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:06.230
I won't be able to invite him again.

354
00:29:11.230 --> 00:29:13.270
I Sang proposed to me.

355
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.210
That's great.

356
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.341
That's it?

357
00:29:20.381 --> 00:29:21.881
Mom, I'm getting married.

358
00:29:22.411 --> 00:29:24.950
You've been talking about marriage for ages now.

359
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:26.420
I feel like you're already married.

360
00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:27.520
Do you expect me to dance or something?

361
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:30.591
Gosh, this is so upsetting.

362
00:29:31.091 --> 00:29:32.960
You're too tired to celebrate...

363
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.861
because you spend your energy taking care of dad.

364
00:29:35.591 --> 00:29:37.591
This is why I never wanted you to meet him again.

365
00:29:37.591 --> 00:29:40.760
See? He showed up all of a sudden only to put you through trouble.

366
00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.270
Why do you keep making it like I'm a pitiful woman?

367
00:29:44.631 --> 00:29:47.200
I know all daughters pity their mothers.

368
00:29:47.401 --> 00:29:48.940
But I don't want my daughter...

369
00:29:49.041 --> 00:29:52.041
to think of me as a pitiful woman who got abandoned by her husband.

370
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.780
You try too hard to embrace my scars.

371
00:29:57.881 --> 00:30:00.250
But if you do that, it'll only make me feel burdened.

372
00:30:00.621 --> 00:30:04.051
I've made peace with the past, but why is it that you still...

373
00:30:04.051 --> 00:30:06.220
hate your dad so much and get angry about what happened?

374
00:30:08.391 --> 00:30:10.391
Are you really okay? Is that why you're taking care of him?

375
00:30:10.891 --> 00:30:12.661
But he made your life so miserable.

376
00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:15.561
Are you seriously okay?

377
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.401
I'm doing this so I won't ever have to see him again.

378
00:30:17.871 --> 00:30:19.500
Your dad is getting discharged tomorrow.

379
00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:21.871
You and I will never have to see him again.

380
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:23.911
So stop getting so angry because of him.

381
00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.341
Just forget about it already.

382
00:30:47.601 --> 00:30:50.831
Eu Ddeum, did you get a paper cut?

383
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:52.301
I'm okay.

384
00:30:53.801 --> 00:30:54.940
Wait here.

385
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.680
Did you teleport?

386
00:31:03.081 --> 00:31:04.450
Give me your hand.

387
00:31:17.131 --> 00:31:18.391
I guess this is how it feels.

388
00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.101
My kindness could cause a misunderstanding.

389
00:31:22.131 --> 00:31:24.301
If I'm nice to people, they might get the wrong idea.

390
00:31:25.401 --> 00:31:26.541
I should be careful.

391
00:31:29.571 --> 00:31:33.010
Well... If you're too kind,

392
00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:35.541
some people could get mistaken.

393
00:31:36.851 --> 00:31:38.010
Same goes for me.

394
00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:44.291
Anyway, just be nice to me since I know you very well.

395
00:31:44.851 --> 00:31:45.950
Okay?

396
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:49.420
Because you know that I don't like you?

397
00:31:50.061 --> 00:31:51.260
I guess you'll never get the wrong idea.

398
00:31:52.561 --> 00:31:54.061
Well, yes.

399
00:31:54.831 --> 00:31:57.131
I won't ever get the wrong idea.

400
00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:59.230
So just be nice to me.

401
00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:02.440
Okay. Thank you.

402
00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.051
Have a good day.

403
00:32:22.121 --> 00:32:23.430
Ms. Jang.

404
00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.760
Can we go home now? We finished sending everything.

405
00:32:28.331 --> 00:32:29.430
Okay, go ahead.

406
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.141
By the way, Mr. Kim wants someone to go...

407
00:32:33.141 --> 00:32:35.940
to the opening of the new store this weekend.

408
00:32:36.101 --> 00:32:37.641
He wants someone who can support to get an advertisement.

409
00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:39.780
Eu Ddeum will be going. Who wants to go with him?

410
00:32:42.981 --> 00:32:44.851
- I'll go. - You?

411
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.320
What's gotten into you?

412
00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:48.280
Because I'm the only one who's available.

413
00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.590
- Great work, everyone. - See you.

414
00:32:53.921 --> 00:32:56.490
- Bye. - Bye.

415
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:59.430
She couldn't be more transparent.

416
00:33:02.101 --> 00:33:03.171
Aren't you heading home?

417
00:33:03.171 --> 00:33:04.371
You go first.

418
00:33:04.501 --> 00:33:05.570
I'll see you tomorrow then.

419
00:33:07.441 --> 00:33:09.240
Let's go.

420
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.411
It's bone soup. Make sure you don't skip any meals.

421
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.450
You shouldn't have.

422
00:33:24.021 --> 00:33:25.621
Don't get sick again until the day you die.

423
00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.961
Don't waste your money and save up for a nursing home.

424
00:33:31.161 --> 00:33:33.061
Don't ask Ha Ri for money,

425
00:33:33.661 --> 00:33:37.300
live out the rest of your life as healthy as you can,

426
00:33:37.470 --> 00:33:38.800
and die without causing a scene.

427
00:33:39.171 --> 00:33:41.470
It's why I took care of you this time.

428
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:44.171
- Must you say it like that? - I...

429
00:33:44.771 --> 00:33:46.510
didn't want to worry Ha Ri...

430
00:33:46.941 --> 00:33:48.541
and be a distraction for her,

431
00:33:49.481 --> 00:33:52.851
so I didn't even contact her when I was lined up for surgery...

432
00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.650
that could leave me dead on the table.

433
00:33:56.081 --> 00:33:58.291
Don't disrupt her life and die quietly.

434
00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:02.461
This can be the one and only thing you end up doing for her.

435
00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:14.840
You don't even know why you live such a pathetic life...

436
00:34:16.911 --> 00:34:18.240
and that's a shame.

437
00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:20.941
Tae Seob,

438
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.050
this'll be the last time we meet.

439
00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:56.311
(Mom's Kalguksu)

440
00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:59.680
Thank you for coming to see me.

441
00:35:00.521 --> 00:35:01.921
Never show yourself again...

442
00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:05.391
and stay away from my mom. That's what I came here to say.

443
00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.661
There was a good chance that I could die,

444
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:13.831
so I wanted to see you for the very last time.

445
00:35:16.061 --> 00:35:19.371
I only borrowed a little money from your mom...

446
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:21.141
to pay for the surgery.

447
00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.510
I was going to pay her back with the insurance money.

448
00:35:26.070 --> 00:35:29.610
I won't bother you two ever again, so don't worry.

449
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.421
Were you fine...

450
00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.061
without us?

451
00:35:48.331 --> 00:35:49.561
I was lonely.

452
00:36:07.521 --> 00:36:08.521
Goodbye.

453
00:36:08.981 --> 00:36:10.751
Sure, take care.

454
00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:31.911
Ha Ri.

455
00:36:36.811 --> 00:36:40.021
I heard that you were upset about not receiving this.

456
00:36:44.791 --> 00:36:47.561
What's wrong? Don't you like it?

457
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.030
I'll get going then.

458
00:37:26.231 --> 00:37:27.831
(Messages)

459
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.070
(Your test results are back from the lab.)

460
00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:32.130
(We'll see you on June 25 at 2pm.)

461
00:37:43.751 --> 00:37:45.380
We don't have all the time in the world.

462
00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:47.150
Hello, sir.

463
00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.780
Hello to you too.

464
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:51.490
You must be the manager.

465
00:37:51.691 --> 00:37:54.090
Well, I'm Choi Hyo Joo from "The Baby".

466
00:37:54.090 --> 00:37:55.490
It's nice to meet you.

467
00:37:56.021 --> 00:37:57.090
Right.

468
00:37:57.731 --> 00:37:59.530
I read the proposal you sent over.

469
00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.101
However, I don't quite get...

470
00:38:02.101 --> 00:38:05.930
how you can come up with a song and dance moves with our products.

471
00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:09.501
Your most-sold product are these organic baby leggings...

472
00:38:09.501 --> 00:38:10.911
and we'll come up...

473
00:38:11.570 --> 00:38:13.641
with a short video that'll make it go viral.

474
00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.510
Like this. "Stretch, stretch"

475
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:21.150
"look how stretchy they are"

476
00:38:23.691 --> 00:38:26.050
Ms. Choi, what about a print advertisement?

477
00:38:26.961 --> 00:38:28.661
"The baby leggings the nation is obsessed over."

478
00:38:28.661 --> 00:38:31.030
"The stretchy leggings loved by both moms and children."

479
00:38:31.331 --> 00:38:35.400
We'll appeal to moms with sophisticated articles.

480
00:38:35.961 --> 00:38:37.101
Take that!

481
00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.271
I see.

482
00:38:43.610 --> 00:38:45.641
(Strollers and Car Seats at a Discounted Price)

483
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:50.311
We got the advertising deal thanks to you. I'm grateful.

484
00:38:50.911 --> 00:38:52.481
I bet you are, right?

485
00:38:53.251 --> 00:38:55.180
Then repay me by taking me to the beach.

486
00:38:55.851 --> 00:38:58.490
- The beach? - It's to show your gratitude.

487
00:38:59.351 --> 00:39:00.360
Let's go.

488
00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:02.421
My gratitude?

489
00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:06.760
Isn't it nice here?

490
00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.360
It is. My gosh.

491
00:39:10.001 --> 00:39:12.400
You're right about this being a way to show one's gratitude.

492
00:39:26.481 --> 00:39:29.421
Are you going to keep working at "The Baby"?

493
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:32.621
Do you envision a different life for yourself...

494
00:39:33.251 --> 00:39:36.930
or have something that triggers your passion or ambition?

495
00:39:37.691 --> 00:39:40.561
I dreamed of becoming a saxophonist.

496
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:44.671
But that was a path for those who had the talent...

497
00:39:44.671 --> 00:39:45.800
to be great.

498
00:39:46.271 --> 00:39:48.171
Those like me who aren't that good...

499
00:39:48.171 --> 00:39:50.041
needed to stick with playing the saxophone as a hobby.

500
00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:53.211
Anyway, my major kept me at a disadvantage when getting a job,

501
00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.541
so I did dream of working in an office one day.

502
00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:00.121
I only learned about advertisement after getting hired at "The Baby",

503
00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:03.820
but it turned out to be something I like.

504
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.220
You'll succeed even more in this field...

505
00:40:07.621 --> 00:40:11.090
because you're smart and have bright energy.

506
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:13.630
- Me? - Yes.

507
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:15.900
No one's ever said that about me before.

508
00:40:16.771 --> 00:40:19.130
It's true though. You should see the way...

509
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:21.101
you shine and sparkle.

510
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:23.610
Thank you.

511
00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:29.340
What do you think about me then?

512
00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.780
You?

513
00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:39.121
Well, I'd say that you're one to bounce unexpectedly.

514
00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:42.791
You make me sound like I'm on a trampoline.

515
00:40:43.061 --> 00:40:44.331
Bounce unexpectedly?

516
00:40:45.331 --> 00:40:46.930
Fine.

517
00:40:47.001 --> 00:40:49.601
How about I bounce along the beach then?

518
00:40:52.171 --> 00:40:53.171
Where are you going?

519
00:40:57.441 --> 00:40:59.110
Be careful or your feet will get wet.

520
00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.340
It's all right.

521
00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.191
See?

522
00:41:10.191 --> 00:41:12.691
Are you kidding me? These are new.

523
00:41:12.751 --> 00:41:14.791
I'll buy you another pair someday.

524
00:41:15.691 --> 00:41:16.860
As if.

525
00:41:20.731 --> 00:41:21.961
Watch out.

526
00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:45.450
What now?

527
00:41:46.021 --> 00:41:47.961
They're all sandy.

528
00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:54.061
I'll buy you a better pair when I can.

529
00:41:58.001 --> 00:41:59.001
Ms. Choi.

530
00:42:02.101 --> 00:42:04.871
Do you perhaps have feelings for me?

531
00:42:23.191 --> 00:42:24.461
I want to be...

532
00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.501
with someone I like too...

533
00:42:29.501 --> 00:42:31.400
instead of someone who I don't like back...

534
00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.771
and experience true love.

535
00:42:42.581 --> 00:42:45.510
It's best if I don't apologize, right?

536
00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:50.820
That's right.

537
00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:54.021
Please don't.

538
00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.200
The lump got slightly bigger.

539
00:43:43.501 --> 00:43:45.711
We have a few months until the follow-up, but...

540
00:43:46.041 --> 00:43:47.411
Are you going to push off the surgery?

541
00:43:59.121 --> 00:44:00.490
It doesn't look good.

542
00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:05.090
It's not like there's no sperm, so pregnancy isn't impossible.

543
00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:10.101
However, since your fiancee is infertile as well,

544
00:44:11.130 --> 00:44:13.030
if you want to do in vitro fertilization,

545
00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:15.601
we need a minimum sperm count.

546
00:44:16.141 --> 00:44:18.941
This treatment was ineffective.

547
00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:24.650
Why don't we try another treatment next time?

548
00:44:52.711 --> 00:44:53.811
What are you doing?

549
00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.581
Are you hoping for the cover page?

550
00:44:57.981 --> 00:44:59.351
I don't know...

551
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.950
what to do.

552
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:06.650
About what?

553
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.760
I felt lost about what it meant...

554
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:13.260
to be a dad.

555
00:45:16.101 --> 00:45:18.300
But I must have gotten my hopes up...

556
00:45:19.731 --> 00:45:21.700
as I shared Ha Ri's dream with her.

557
00:45:28.041 --> 00:45:29.141
I may not...

558
00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:32.811
be able to become a dad.

559
00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.481
What do you mean?

560
00:45:39.751 --> 00:45:40.791
Will it be hard?

561
00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:42.990
Did he say it won't work?

562
00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:48.130
This must be...

563
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:51.400
how Ha Ri felt.

564
00:46:07.921 --> 00:46:09.481
- Hey. - Auntie.

565
00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:14.220
I was going to get Do Ah's things and leave quietly.

566
00:46:14.391 --> 00:46:15.421
Go back to sleep.

567
00:46:15.621 --> 00:46:17.391
Stop acting like this is someone else's house.

568
00:46:17.391 --> 00:46:19.360
- Sleep over. - That's silly.

569
00:46:19.831 --> 00:46:22.001
I'll say bye before I leave,

570
00:46:22.001 --> 00:46:23.661
so get some rest. Go back in.

571
00:47:21.161 --> 00:47:23.421
(Ha Ri)

572
00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:38.610
(I Sang)

573
00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:55.320
Hello? Ha Ri?

574
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:14.110
(I Sang)

575
00:48:23.621 --> 00:48:25.320
Ha Ri. Are you there?

576
00:48:28.921 --> 00:48:30.021
Ha Ri?

577
00:48:30.021 --> 00:48:31.030
(I Sang)

578
00:48:31.191 --> 00:48:34.601
Hello? Hello? Ha Ri.

579
00:48:35.231 --> 00:48:36.400
Hello?

580
00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.470
Hey, Ha Ri!

581
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:39.030
Are you okay?

582
00:48:40.101 --> 00:48:41.141
Open up.

583
00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.740
Open up. Ha Ri!

584
00:48:44.671 --> 00:48:46.570
What's wrong?

585
00:48:47.211 --> 00:48:48.941
What's wrong? What's going on?

586
00:48:49.141 --> 00:48:50.950
I think something's wrong with Ha Ri!

587
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:53.010
Ha Ri!

588
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:55.380
Hey! Open up!

589
00:49:02.461 --> 00:49:04.430
Hey, Ha Ri. Ha Ri.

590
00:49:05.561 --> 00:49:06.891
What's wrong? Get up.

591
00:49:06.891 --> 00:49:08.800
- Oh my gosh. What's wrong with her? - What's wrong?

592
00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:11.001
Hey. Ha Ri. What's wrong with her?

593
00:49:11.001 --> 00:49:12.300
Oh no.

594
00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:14.300
- Let's get her to the ER. - Okay.

595
00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:15.371
- Get up. - Can you get up?

596
00:49:15.371 --> 00:49:17.610
Let's go to the hospital. Get up. Oh no.

597
00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:19.411
- Oh no. - What's wrong?

598
00:49:19.411 --> 00:49:21.610
(I Sang)

599
00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.541
Is Ha Ri okay?

600
00:49:51.541 --> 00:49:54.240
They examined her and gave her pain killers. She's asleep now.

601
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:56.641
I think it's the endometriosis. Go in and see her.

602
00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:01.981
I'll go now.

603
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:04.191
Okay.

604
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:06.150
Thank you, Jae Young.

605
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:08.161
- Sure. Go in. - Bye.

606
00:50:13.661 --> 00:50:14.731
I Sang.

607
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:23.141
"Ha Ri wouldn't be suffering that much if she were with me."

608
00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:29.581
Don't make me think things like that again.

609
00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:34.081
Please.

610
00:50:58.271 --> 00:51:00.740
Sleep more. They said to go after the bag is finished.

611
00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:02.811
- Okay. - Gosh.

612
00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:09.981
You should lie down.

613
00:51:10.751 --> 00:51:11.791
Hi.

614
00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:15.461
My back hurts. I'm not dying.

615
00:51:16.291 --> 00:51:18.490
Stop worrying so much. You're making me feel bad.

616
00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:19.731
It's nothing serious.

617
00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:22.300
Ms. Jang Ha Ri?

618
00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:27.271
- You're not in pain anymore, right? - No.

619
00:51:29.171 --> 00:51:32.641
The lump grew a little more since your last examination.

620
00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:35.141
I don't think we should leave it as-is.

621
00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.311
Why don't you consider getting surgery?

622
00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:43.521
But... It'll be harder to get pregnant if I get surgery.

623
00:51:43.921 --> 00:51:45.391
We'll have to wait and see,

624
00:51:45.391 --> 00:51:47.421
but yes, there's a high risk that it'll reduce ovarian function.

625
00:51:47.891 --> 00:51:50.621
As I told you last time,

626
00:51:50.891 --> 00:51:52.691
your fertility level is already low...

627
00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:55.030
even without the endometriosis.

628
00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.371
So if you get surgery and treatments for a year,

629
00:51:58.371 --> 00:52:00.101
it may become more difficult than it is now.

630
00:52:02.601 --> 00:52:05.371
It's not like she can never have kids, right?

631
00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:09.411
It would be nice to get a fertility treatment now, but...

632
00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:12.450
It isn't impossible.

633
00:52:53.351 --> 00:52:54.490
I...

634
00:52:55.521 --> 00:52:57.121
made you get your hopes up.

635
00:52:58.990 --> 00:53:01.231
If you're postponing the surgery because of me,

636
00:53:02.161 --> 00:53:03.300
please don't.

637
00:53:06.001 --> 00:53:08.441
Do you remember what I said?

638
00:53:11.211 --> 00:53:12.970
I told you to focus on yourself...

639
00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.041
if my test results don't come out that great.

640
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:21.521
What's the matter?

641
00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:36.501
The test results weren't that good.

642
00:53:42.271 --> 00:53:43.641
I could get treated for another three months...

643
00:53:44.941 --> 00:53:47.271
and repeat the same thing all over again.

644
00:53:48.081 --> 00:53:49.311
But I can't guarantee...

645
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:52.880
that the result will come out okay.

646
00:54:01.161 --> 00:54:02.661
If you're enduring your pain...

647
00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:11.731
because you want to wait until I'm ready,

648
00:54:11.831 --> 00:54:12.970
just don't.

649
00:54:15.601 --> 00:54:16.771
I've been...

650
00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:20.070
postponing it because it'll make things harder for me.

651
00:54:22.541 --> 00:54:24.550
It's not because of you.

652
00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:30.320
There's still a chance...

653
00:54:30.921 --> 00:54:33.791
for you to get pregnant even after the surgery.

654
00:54:35.021 --> 00:54:38.061
You can look for a way once you're better.

655
00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:43.200
But now, you need to get the surgery.

656
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:48.800
Are you okay?

657
00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:53.240
I'm sure you're having a hard time as well.

658
00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:00.481
I'm okay.

659
00:55:15.061 --> 00:55:16.061
What's wrong?

660
00:55:17.671 --> 00:55:19.470
Is it because of Ha Ri's illness?

661
00:55:20.271 --> 00:55:23.001
Are you thinking of postponing the wedding?

662
00:55:23.641 --> 00:55:26.311
No, not at all.

663
00:55:29.141 --> 00:55:30.481
Ha Ri might...

664
00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:33.711
try to postpone the surgery because of me...

665
00:55:34.251 --> 00:55:36.280
even though she's in pain.

666
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:41.320
So I think...

667
00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.391
you should convince her to get the surgery.

668
00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:48.501
Because of you?

669
00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.400
Yes.

670
00:55:55.070 --> 00:55:56.101
Right now,

671
00:55:59.311 --> 00:56:00.641
I'm...

672
00:56:02.041 --> 00:56:03.581
unable to have kids.

673
00:56:09.251 --> 00:56:10.421
I'm also...

674
00:56:14.121 --> 00:56:15.360
subfertile.

675
00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:23.001
The doctor told me I'll get better if I receive treatment.

676
00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:25.501
But a few days ago,

677
00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:28.271
the test results...

678
00:56:29.671 --> 00:56:31.041
didn't come out that great.

679
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.110
Here. Eat up even though you don't have an appetite.

680
00:58:12.441 --> 00:58:13.711
Eat and cheer up.

681
00:58:19.311 --> 00:58:20.811
You should get the surgery.

682
00:58:21.981 --> 00:58:25.351
I always felt sorry that you had to grow up...

683
00:58:25.851 --> 00:58:27.421
without a dad.

684
00:58:28.621 --> 00:58:31.791
When you told me you wanted to have a baby by yourself,

685
00:58:32.260 --> 00:58:35.530
I was worried you might end up feeling sorry for your child.

686
00:58:36.231 --> 00:58:37.700
But it's not like I could stop you either.

687
00:58:38.171 --> 00:58:42.001
You finally found someone nice, so I'm no longer worried about that.

688
00:58:44.171 --> 00:58:45.970
But you can't force things to happen.

689
00:58:46.141 --> 00:58:48.481
You just need to do what you can.

690
00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:51.680
Mom.

691
00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:55.220
Telling me to get the surgery...

692
00:58:55.751 --> 00:58:58.191
is like telling me to give up on having a child.

693
00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:02.791
I did think about living without a child.

694
00:59:05.461 --> 00:59:08.331
But I can't just give up so easily.

695
00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.171
If I give up,

696
00:59:12.771 --> 00:59:15.200
I'll never get to be a mom.

697
00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:25.650
I was too busy trying to make a living,

698
00:59:26.311 --> 00:59:28.650
so I never even knew how exhausted I was.

699
00:59:29.751 --> 00:59:31.950
Back then, I hated my life...

700
00:59:32.351 --> 00:59:34.921
because nothing ever seemed to work out.

701
00:59:36.791 --> 00:59:38.990
But now that I look back, I wasn't that miserable.

702
00:59:39.291 --> 00:59:42.200
I just did my best every day and worked hard.

703
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:45.630
This might feel like a big deal to you right now,

704
00:59:46.101 --> 00:59:48.671
but this won't make you miserable.

705
00:59:50.171 --> 00:59:53.811
I know that you won't become miserable.

706
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:08.090
- Let's eat. - Okay, eat up.

707
01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.641
(Surgical Ward)

708
01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:27.800
(Surgical Ward)

709
01:02:09.711 --> 01:02:10.711
Are you okay?

710
01:02:11.851 --> 01:02:13.351
I feel a lot better than I expected.

711
01:02:15.251 --> 01:02:17.950
- Ha Ri, you don't need to... - Let's go. I don't want to be late.

712
01:02:21.921 --> 01:02:23.461
Let's eat something nice for dinner.

713
01:02:23.461 --> 01:02:24.990
There are tons of restaurants we've never been to.

714
01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.411
- Hey, Ms. Jang. - Hey.

715
01:02:45.851 --> 01:02:47.050
Ms. Jang.

716
01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:49.121
Are you okay?

717
01:02:49.621 --> 01:02:50.680
Yes.

718
01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:53.521
You should've gotten some more rest.

719
01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:56.121
I wouldn't be at work if I wasn't all right.

720
01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:58.961
Don't we have a lot to do? What should I begin with?

721
01:02:59.691 --> 01:03:00.691
Please don't immerse yourself in your work...

722
01:03:00.691 --> 01:03:02.700
to take your mind off things.

723
01:03:02.961 --> 01:03:05.331
You wouldn't be able to focus, anyway.

724
01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:06.800
Why you...

725
01:03:09.001 --> 01:03:12.671
Could you sort out the list of book recommendations?

726
01:03:12.671 --> 01:03:13.771
Sure.

727
01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:19.711
("My Mom")

728
01:03:27.521 --> 01:03:28.961
I feel a lot better than I expected.

729
01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:32.561
Yes, it's already out.

730
01:03:32.791 --> 01:03:34.961
I'll leave it downstairs, so come by at any time.

731
01:03:35.331 --> 01:03:38.800
Of course, they all look good. Did you forget who took them?

732
01:03:40.001 --> 01:03:41.130
I'll take it to her.

733
01:03:42.171 --> 01:03:43.671
But it's not urgent...

734
01:03:45.871 --> 01:03:49.510
("My Mom")

735
01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.411
("My Mom")

736
01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.490
(Mommy)

737
01:04:04.961 --> 01:04:10.231
(Mom)

738
01:04:18.811 --> 01:04:20.041
(Mom)

739
01:04:20.041 --> 01:04:23.510
(Mom)

740
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:24.880
(Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom)

741
01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:36.061
(Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom)

742
01:04:44.661 --> 01:04:48.771
(Secret Diary)

743
01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:58.650
(Mom)

744
01:04:59.150 --> 01:05:02.450
(Mom)

745
01:05:41.090 --> 01:05:47.430
(Mom)

746
01:07:25.631 --> 01:07:28.501
(Oh My Baby)

747
01:07:31.501 --> 01:07:33.931
Is that what Ha Ri wants?

748
01:07:35.471 --> 01:07:36.541
No.

749
01:07:37.801 --> 01:07:39.440
Even though it breaks her heart,

750
01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:44.081
she would never give up on the person she loves.

751
01:07:45.251 --> 01:07:46.911
Don't let her wait for me.

752
01:07:48.011 --> 01:07:49.121
Ha Ri...

753
01:07:50.181 --> 01:07:52.251
should be with someone who can give her everything...

754
01:07:54.091 --> 01:07:55.261
and be happy.
