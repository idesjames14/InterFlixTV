00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:04.045
(Good job!)

2
00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:14.777
It's us grown-ups who really need compliments.

3
00:01:17.048 --> 00:01:18.317
Good job, Mr. Han.

4
00:01:30.898 --> 00:01:33.027
As much as I'll be here on time at 8am,

5
00:01:33.027 --> 00:01:36.067
please make sure I can leave every day at 7pm.

6
00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:38.567
I expect to get paid extra even if you're 10 minutes late.

7
00:01:38.567 --> 00:01:40.007
And I don't work on weekends.

8
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:42.408
If you want a premium service such as baby massages...

9
00:01:42.408 --> 00:01:46.048
and premium baby food, you need to pay 300 dollars more.

10
00:01:46.347 --> 00:01:48.278
Do you have any questions?

11
00:01:49.918 --> 00:01:52.347
- We'll go broke if we are late... - Don't.

12
00:01:52.347 --> 00:01:54.418
Should I ask her? No?

13
00:01:57.487 --> 00:01:59.587
If I get off work early, will I get a discount?

14
00:02:01.358 --> 00:02:03.627
My goodness, I didn't know you guys were married.

15
00:02:04.727 --> 00:02:07.498
My gosh, I guess you really weren't homeless after all.

16
00:02:09.837 --> 00:02:12.438
Then what about that other kid? Was that your second child?

17
00:02:14.337 --> 00:02:15.337
Is this your second marriage?

18
00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:18.608
Did you have an affair?

19
00:02:19.207 --> 00:02:21.248
My goodness, I guess that must be it.

20
00:02:22.018 --> 00:02:23.218
Did they really have an affair?

21
00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:24.948
My goodness.

22
00:02:25.847 --> 00:02:28.787
- Goodbye. - See you at our aerobics class!

23
00:02:28.858 --> 00:02:30.257
- Bye! - Goodbye.

24
00:02:31.257 --> 00:02:32.287
Did you recommend her, Mom?

25
00:02:32.757 --> 00:02:33.828
This is absurd.

26
00:02:35.158 --> 00:02:36.358
My gosh, this is exhausting.

27
00:02:38.168 --> 00:02:40.698
It's so hard to get a babysitter.

28
00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:42.198
What are you going to do? Your hospital is going to open soon.

29
00:02:42.198 --> 00:02:45.108
I'll leave her at the daycare center until 3pm.

30
00:02:45.467 --> 00:02:46.707
Then I'll just have to bring her to my office.

31
00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:50.138
By the way, how do you know all those women?

32
00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:51.478
How about you?

33
00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:53.578
I don't even want to talk about it.

34
00:02:58.647 --> 00:02:59.747
Ha Ri.

35
00:03:00.418 --> 00:03:01.858
What are you going to do now?

36
00:03:01.918 --> 00:03:04.217
Why don't you help me prepare some stuff for the opening?

37
00:03:04.628 --> 00:03:06.087
How about we have some fun?

38
00:03:07.557 --> 00:03:10.728
Don't even think about it and pay me if you want my service.

39
00:03:11.828 --> 00:03:12.967
It was worth a try.

40
00:03:15.798 --> 00:03:16.937
Hello.

41
00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:18.407
Good to see you.

42
00:03:18.608 --> 00:03:20.138
This is our schedule for the day.

43
00:03:21.508 --> 00:03:22.907
(10am: I Sang and Ha Ri: My Child's First Friend of the Opposite Sex)

44
00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:25.508
(10am: I Sang and Ha Ri: My Child's First Friend of the Opposite Sex)

45
00:03:26.277 --> 00:03:27.407
Ms. Jang has a photoshoot?

46
00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:29.448
She takes her job very seriously.

47
00:03:29.717 --> 00:03:32.848
Her suspension only means that she needs to stay clear of her boss.

48
00:03:34.888 --> 00:03:36.018
Good morning.

49
00:03:48.598 --> 00:03:49.737
What's the photoshoot for?

50
00:03:51.707 --> 00:03:52.807
Don't be so obvious.

51
00:04:01.478 --> 00:04:03.117
It's an article on children having friends of the opposite sex.

52
00:04:07.048 --> 00:04:09.187
My gosh, you startled me.

53
00:04:09.318 --> 00:04:11.527
- What gives? - I'm sorry about that.

54
00:04:12.858 --> 00:04:15.027
This isn't your photoshoot though.

55
00:04:15.298 --> 00:04:17.157
I told Ha Ri to stay home...

56
00:04:17.157 --> 00:04:18.927
since I could manage this myself.

57
00:04:20.798 --> 00:04:24.038
It's a monthly series of ours, so Sang Hee knows what to do.

58
00:04:26.407 --> 00:04:28.608
Would she be in the mood to work when she was suspended?

59
00:04:29.337 --> 00:04:31.807
I told her to stay well away from this place.

60
00:04:36.617 --> 00:04:38.318
That's unnecessary camaraderie.

61
00:04:39.888 --> 00:04:43.288
- Sorry? - What kind of photos do you need?

62
00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:44.987
Unbelievable...

63
00:04:45.328 --> 00:04:48.128
I want the two of them shot from the front...

64
00:04:48.497 --> 00:04:50.527
- but leave some space up top. - Gosh.

65
00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.268
I see right through you.

66
00:04:52.568 --> 00:04:54.797
Please leave some space up top for the title.

67
00:04:55.268 --> 00:04:56.368
I heard you.

68
00:04:59.568 --> 00:05:03.337
- Just a bit more... - I'll adjust as we go.

69
00:05:09.748 --> 00:05:13.417
(Episode 5: When We Wish to Believe in Fate)

70
00:05:21.857 --> 00:05:22.957
Mom.

71
00:05:24.698 --> 00:05:27.568
Hold on. What brings you by?

72
00:05:30.998 --> 00:05:33.238
- Hello, sir. - Hi.

73
00:05:40.347 --> 00:05:41.518
Here you go.

74
00:05:42.647 --> 00:05:44.847
Why are you treating me like a patient?

75
00:05:45.047 --> 00:05:46.748
Because you are.

76
00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:49.157
You should stick to food that is easy to digest.

77
00:05:54.628 --> 00:05:55.797
Gosh.

78
00:05:56.758 --> 00:05:58.467
Are you aiming to be a professional guitarist?

79
00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:00.167
You shouldn't play in this condition of yours.

80
00:06:00.597 --> 00:06:02.597
My sore wrist goes back to my days working in diners.

81
00:06:03.068 --> 00:06:06.707
I can't believe the pain is back after a few guitar strokes.

82
00:06:07.738 --> 00:06:10.907
Don't overexert yourself. It's just a stupid guitar.

83
00:06:11.748 --> 00:06:13.678
It isn't for me.

84
00:06:14.147 --> 00:06:18.087
Playing "Spanish Romance" has been a lifelong dream of mine.

85
00:06:18.488 --> 00:06:19.787
Your father distracted me though,

86
00:06:19.787 --> 00:06:21.888
so I was only able to manage "Edelweiss".

87
00:06:22.587 --> 00:06:25.558
Darn it. When you fall for someone,

88
00:06:25.558 --> 00:06:28.328
you tend to fall hard.

89
00:06:31.628 --> 00:06:34.097
Luck seems to have found you in your later years though.

90
00:06:34.097 --> 00:06:36.097
Your cancer was detected in the early stages...

91
00:06:36.097 --> 00:06:39.008
and you have enough money to do what you want in your life.

92
00:06:39.238 --> 00:06:41.308
That doesn't mean a thing to me...

93
00:06:41.607 --> 00:06:43.277
because my body isn't what it used to be.

94
00:06:43.777 --> 00:06:46.777
How great would it be to do everything I missed out on...

95
00:06:46.777 --> 00:06:49.777
when I had to work hard to keep food on the table?

96
00:06:53.748 --> 00:06:54.888
Exactly.

97
00:06:55.917 --> 00:06:57.758
We all should do what we want in life.

98
00:06:58.258 --> 00:07:00.688
It's why I want to give birth to a child.

99
00:07:00.957 --> 00:07:02.797
I'm not producing enough eggs...

100
00:07:02.897 --> 00:07:05.568
and my chances of pregnancy will only get slimmer...

101
00:07:05.568 --> 00:07:06.967
once I receive surgery for my endometriosis.

102
00:07:13.467 --> 00:07:14.878
It's nothing serious though.

103
00:07:19.777 --> 00:07:20.878
Wait.

104
00:07:22.217 --> 00:07:23.417
Was that about you?

105
00:07:26.147 --> 00:07:27.847
I can have the baby...

106
00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:29.488
and receive surgery for endometriosis.

107
00:07:29.488 --> 00:07:30.717
It's nothing.

108
00:07:30.957 --> 00:07:33.957
Now eat up before it gets cold.

109
00:07:34.628 --> 00:07:35.797
Come on.

110
00:07:36.157 --> 00:07:37.397
There you go.

111
00:07:42.738 --> 00:07:44.967
You want to go through IVF on your own?

112
00:07:44.967 --> 00:07:46.938
Did I misunderstand that or are you insane?

113
00:07:47.068 --> 00:07:48.738
I told you I was done wanting a marriage.

114
00:07:49.378 --> 00:07:50.578
I'd rather have a kid instead.

115
00:07:51.448 --> 00:07:53.578
You really are insane, aren't you?

116
00:07:53.578 --> 00:07:55.477
People will constantly judge me for this,

117
00:07:55.777 --> 00:07:57.378
so can you at least be on my side?

118
00:07:57.647 --> 00:08:00.318
I'm all on board with you buying green onions.

119
00:08:00.318 --> 00:08:03.258
But how can I support you when it's sperms you want to buy?

120
00:08:05.157 --> 00:08:06.558
I'm not buying anything.

121
00:08:07.488 --> 00:08:09.058
It'll be consensual.

122
00:08:09.558 --> 00:08:10.628
And keep your voice down.

123
00:08:12.527 --> 00:08:15.438
My friend, Ha Ri, I strongly am against this idea.

124
00:08:15.438 --> 00:08:17.537
- Well, I think it's perfect. - Wait.

125
00:08:19.268 --> 00:08:22.078
So you're seriously thinking about having this baby?

126
00:08:22.477 --> 00:08:25.378
On your own when it's hard enough to raise a child with a partner?

127
00:08:26.078 --> 00:08:28.448
Fine. Let's say that it's doable.

128
00:08:28.547 --> 00:08:31.347
What if a decent man comes your way?

129
00:08:33.018 --> 00:08:35.917
I tortured myself with that thought for 20 years.

130
00:08:36.417 --> 00:08:38.957
I'm done trying to meet a husband.

131
00:08:42.097 --> 00:08:44.967
My friend, don't close the door to your options...

132
00:08:45.128 --> 00:08:46.727
and reconsider the men...

133
00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:49.037
that you once dumped or took a pass on.

134
00:08:49.097 --> 00:08:52.438
You'll be surprised by the revelation it could bring you.

135
00:08:52.438 --> 00:08:55.607
Just keep digging, okay? There are many decent men out there.

136
00:08:55.678 --> 00:08:57.378
Like whom? Do you know anyone?

137
00:08:59.948 --> 00:09:01.948
Wait. What about my sister's husband?

138
00:09:02.178 --> 00:09:03.417
As you know,

139
00:09:03.417 --> 00:09:05.748
he makes himself breakfast before going to work,

140
00:09:05.748 --> 00:09:07.248
get the kids to school,

141
00:09:07.248 --> 00:09:08.718
takes the family abroad every year,

142
00:09:08.718 --> 00:09:10.657
and only has eyes for my sister.

143
00:09:10.718 --> 00:09:11.787
I know.

144
00:09:12.557 --> 00:09:14.787
Your brother-in-law is the best.

145
00:09:15.258 --> 00:09:16.397
See?

146
00:09:16.628 --> 00:09:18.468
He must be here to shop with your sister.

147
00:09:19.228 --> 00:09:20.327
That's him, right?

148
00:09:20.797 --> 00:09:22.167
Did your sister lose weight?

149
00:09:22.397 --> 00:09:24.567
Check out her slender figure.

150
00:09:27.508 --> 00:09:28.608
Here.

151
00:09:29.838 --> 00:09:31.547
Who's the young woman?

152
00:09:32.147 --> 00:09:33.277
- Don't wait for me. - What?

153
00:09:34.108 --> 00:09:36.917
Eun Young, take a photo first.

154
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.147
As evidence!

155
00:09:40.147 --> 00:09:41.248
Brother-in-law?

156
00:09:45.388 --> 00:09:46.628
Who is this woman?

157
00:09:50.827 --> 00:09:53.567
You have the wrong person.

158
00:09:53.927 --> 00:09:56.838
Hold on. Wait. Stop right there.

159
00:09:57.167 --> 00:09:58.338
Stop!

160
00:09:58.868 --> 00:10:00.108
You have the wrong person.

161
00:10:00.368 --> 00:10:02.537
Oh, dear.

162
00:10:05.677 --> 00:10:07.378
I'm not your brother-in-law.

163
00:10:07.547 --> 00:10:09.047
- Stop! - Darn it.

164
00:10:10.348 --> 00:10:13.888
- I'm not who you think I am. - Stop!

165
00:10:14.388 --> 00:10:15.518
Wait!

166
00:10:16.287 --> 00:10:19.358
- I'm not your brother-in-law. - You are!

167
00:10:19.888 --> 00:10:21.057
I'm not!

168
00:10:24.057 --> 00:10:26.628
Eun Young used to think I was pathetic...

169
00:10:26.628 --> 00:10:28.638
for wanting to get married.

170
00:10:29.238 --> 00:10:30.868
As a successful app developer,

171
00:10:30.868 --> 00:10:32.738
she was on the verge of launching her startup.

172
00:10:33.268 --> 00:10:35.608
She went to an investor for an investment...

173
00:10:36.978 --> 00:10:38.647
and her life got turned upside down.

174
00:10:39.047 --> 00:10:40.677
A sudden attraction...

175
00:10:40.777 --> 00:10:42.947
led to marriage and pregnancy.

176
00:10:43.647 --> 00:10:46.018
Until then, she was confident...

177
00:10:46.018 --> 00:10:47.218
that she could be a working mom...

178
00:10:47.218 --> 00:10:49.417
which was tough even for Superwoman.

179
00:10:49.657 --> 00:10:52.358
That's because she had no idea she'd have pre-eclampsia...

180
00:10:52.557 --> 00:10:55.397
and would nearly die giving birth prematurely to twins.

181
00:10:57.858 --> 00:11:00.598
Who knew she'd go from dreaming to be a successful entrepreneur...

182
00:11:00.927 --> 00:11:02.567
to a woman fixated on childbirth?

183
00:11:02.897 --> 00:11:06.437
Who knew she'd one day run after her cheating brother-in-law?

184
00:11:07.307 --> 00:11:09.378
What I learned in my life of 39 years...

185
00:11:10.708 --> 00:11:13.478
is that good things just don't happen to you.

186
00:11:14.077 --> 00:11:16.518
Only the unfortunate smack you from behind.

187
00:11:17.077 --> 00:11:20.647
Nothing will happen if you don't take action.

188
00:11:21.287 --> 00:11:22.388
That is why...

189
00:11:23.358 --> 00:11:25.088
I must do something.

190
00:11:29.728 --> 00:11:30.958
Yoon Jae Young.

191
00:11:31.628 --> 00:11:32.628
From an objective point of view,

192
00:11:32.628 --> 00:11:34.728
he does have good qualities I'd want in my child.

193
00:11:36.738 --> 00:11:38.167
If I asked him for his sperm though,

194
00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:42.577
he'd patronize me.

195
00:11:43.037 --> 00:11:45.848
(Potential sperm donor no. 2: Yoon Jae Young)

196
00:11:47.077 --> 00:11:48.208
Han I Sang.

197
00:11:48.317 --> 00:11:50.817
See? He's not that bad either.

198
00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:52.848
Most of all,

199
00:11:53.988 --> 00:11:55.118
he's kind of cool.

200
00:11:58.218 --> 00:11:59.358
Why am I smiling though...

201
00:12:00.488 --> 00:12:02.057
when he'd never agree to it?

202
00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:05.628
(Potential sperm donor no. 3: Han I Sang)

203
00:12:08.128 --> 00:12:09.537
Choi Kang Eu Ddeum.

204
00:12:11.167 --> 00:12:12.368
Of course.

205
00:12:15.978 --> 00:12:20.748
(Potential sperm donor no. 1: Choi Kang Eu Ddeum)

206
00:12:26.147 --> 00:12:27.848
Unbelievable.

207
00:12:32.787 --> 00:12:34.427
Eu Ddeum, can I talk to you?

208
00:12:35.598 --> 00:12:36.797
Sure thing.

209
00:12:39.427 --> 00:12:42.567
How can you write up a report like this?

210
00:12:42.697 --> 00:12:43.768
What a joke.

211
00:12:43.768 --> 00:12:46.008
A project proposal should be simple and impressive.

212
00:12:46.238 --> 00:12:49.037
The client should take a glimpse at it...

213
00:12:49.037 --> 00:12:52.047
and want to bring its advertisements to us.

214
00:12:52.447 --> 00:12:55.348
- It needs to be a sales pitch. - As if could do any better.

215
00:12:55.348 --> 00:12:58.018
How is it that you still can't get this right?

216
00:12:59.248 --> 00:13:00.618
I'll write up another one.

217
00:13:01.718 --> 00:13:02.858
So much for being a fast learner.

218
00:13:02.858 --> 00:13:04.888
He acted like he knew everything.

219
00:13:05.327 --> 00:13:06.527
Seriously.

220
00:13:08.728 --> 00:13:09.998
How will he ever survive?

221
00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:13.167
Eu Ddeum.

222
00:13:20.238 --> 00:13:22.008
This is a true or false quiz.

223
00:13:23.238 --> 00:13:24.937
True and false? I can do it.

224
00:13:25.447 --> 00:13:27.547
A man donated his sperm.

225
00:13:27.547 --> 00:13:31.218
Only one infertile couple may receive the sperm.

226
00:13:31.218 --> 00:13:32.388
True or false?

227
00:13:32.417 --> 00:13:35.157
Choi Kang Eu Ddeum. False.

228
00:13:35.157 --> 00:13:36.888
- Correct. - Yes.

229
00:13:38.088 --> 00:13:40.657
If we were to submit a proposal...

230
00:13:40.787 --> 00:13:43.128
to a fertility clinic regarding a sperm donation campaign...

231
00:13:44.128 --> 00:13:45.868
Because that's what you're interested in?

232
00:13:47.797 --> 00:13:49.067
Let's say that's true.

233
00:13:49.238 --> 00:13:51.397
What would be more effective,

234
00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:52.868
writing down...

235
00:13:52.937 --> 00:13:55.307
the benefits of advertising...

236
00:13:55.608 --> 00:13:57.037
or a quiz like just now?

237
00:13:57.777 --> 00:13:59.307
- A quiz. - Right?

238
00:13:59.947 --> 00:14:02.118
That's how you should write the proposal.

239
00:14:02.518 --> 00:14:04.777
Think of a concept the client may be interested in,

240
00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:07.588
and come up with a magazine ad or a video.

241
00:14:07.588 --> 00:14:08.787
Consult the reporters.

242
00:14:11.088 --> 00:14:12.827
You're like a lecturer.

243
00:14:18.498 --> 00:14:19.667
Ha Ri came.

244
00:14:19.897 --> 00:14:21.598
Why? Did something happen?

245
00:14:21.797 --> 00:14:24.468
No. She and Eu Ddeum...

246
00:14:24.738 --> 00:14:27.608
were doing something in secret.

247
00:14:28.067 --> 00:14:29.878
With Eu Ddeum?

248
00:14:30.437 --> 00:14:31.508
What?

249
00:14:36.218 --> 00:14:38.277
They were in a conference room, so it was probably a meeting.

250
00:14:41.018 --> 00:14:42.488
What's wrong with my eyes?

251
00:14:42.858 --> 00:14:44.187
They sting.

252
00:14:44.388 --> 00:14:45.958
I've been staring at the monitor for too long.

253
00:14:46.458 --> 00:14:48.598
Hey. Open the windows and air out the place.

254
00:14:48.758 --> 00:14:49.897
Okay.

255
00:14:52.628 --> 00:14:53.868
So...

256
00:15:00.138 --> 00:15:01.807
What do you think...

257
00:15:02.478 --> 00:15:04.508
about sperm donation, now that you've heard about it?

258
00:15:07.277 --> 00:15:09.348
Not the proposal, but sperm donation?

259
00:15:10.277 --> 00:15:13.088
No, well... I just wonder if my explanation...

260
00:15:13.088 --> 00:15:14.817
was effective.

261
00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:20.327
But you can't receive sperm...

262
00:15:20.327 --> 00:15:21.458
even if you want to.

263
00:15:22.057 --> 00:15:23.098
Because you're single.

264
00:15:25.667 --> 00:15:27.498
I'm looking for a way.

265
00:15:28.197 --> 00:15:29.638
Something not illegal.

266
00:15:33.138 --> 00:15:34.268
What if...

267
00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:37.138
the child wants to know about the dad later?

268
00:15:40.108 --> 00:15:42.047
That's why I plan to get his consent first.

269
00:15:42.777 --> 00:15:45.588
Whether or not I can tell the child about him if the child asks.

270
00:15:45.588 --> 00:15:48.888
If he's willing to meet the child if the child...

271
00:15:49.588 --> 00:15:51.187
wants to meet him.

272
00:15:53.258 --> 00:15:54.687
To the donor?

273
00:15:55.858 --> 00:15:57.057
Yes.

274
00:15:59.297 --> 00:16:03.268
But first, I'd have to explain it to the child...

275
00:16:03.268 --> 00:16:04.797
so he or she understands.

276
00:16:07.338 --> 00:16:11.008
"Mommy wanted to meet you so badly,"

277
00:16:11.378 --> 00:16:13.907
"that I asked a kind man for help."

278
00:16:15.447 --> 00:16:17.647
"But just because he gave you life..."

279
00:16:17.647 --> 00:16:19.518
"doesn't make him your dad."

280
00:16:20.547 --> 00:16:22.588
"Not because he doesn't love you,"

281
00:16:23.488 --> 00:16:25.888
"but because he and Mommy don't love each other."

282
00:16:26.128 --> 00:16:27.758
"That's why."

283
00:16:33.427 --> 00:16:35.667
I know for sure I can love my baby,

284
00:16:39.838 --> 00:16:41.838
but the baby will want more, right?

285
00:16:44.878 --> 00:16:46.608
I'm sure your child...

286
00:16:50.447 --> 00:16:53.348
will be lucky to have you for a mom.

287
00:16:59.388 --> 00:17:00.458
Thank you.

288
00:17:05.667 --> 00:17:06.868
So...

289
00:17:09.838 --> 00:17:11.537
the biological dad...

290
00:17:12.907 --> 00:17:16.508
needs to have healthy genes...

291
00:17:16.708 --> 00:17:17.838
Exactly.

292
00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:20.508
How do you find out?

293
00:17:25.047 --> 00:17:26.147
So...

294
00:17:30.018 --> 00:17:33.027
You must be done with the proposal if you're hanging out here.

295
00:17:35.958 --> 00:17:37.897
And you didn't get your physical, did you?

296
00:17:38.027 --> 00:17:39.597
You have to get it this week.

297
00:17:40.728 --> 00:17:42.097
Yes, sir.

298
00:17:42.097 --> 00:17:43.198
Me too.

299
00:17:46.438 --> 00:17:47.708
I need to get mine too.

300
00:17:51.637 --> 00:17:52.708
I will.

301
00:18:00.448 --> 00:18:02.117
- Are you leaving? - Yes.

302
00:18:10.998 --> 00:18:12.067
Hey.

303
00:18:12.597 --> 00:18:13.867
What?

304
00:18:14.698 --> 00:18:15.698
What is it?

305
00:18:22.478 --> 00:18:23.577
Shall we?

306
00:18:24.337 --> 00:18:25.708
What do you want?

307
00:18:26.807 --> 00:18:28.008
That hits the spot.

308
00:18:30.218 --> 00:18:31.847
Are you not over In Ah?

309
00:18:33.748 --> 00:18:36.317
How do you ask that without even a warning?

310
00:18:36.317 --> 00:18:37.817
I wondered...

311
00:18:37.887 --> 00:18:41.258
if that was why you can't date someone even if you like her.

312
00:18:41.827 --> 00:18:43.698
I'm not dating because it's comfortable being alone.

313
00:18:44.728 --> 00:18:46.827
To be honest, you envy me.

314
00:18:46.827 --> 00:18:48.067
Like crazy.

315
00:18:51.938 --> 00:18:54.468
I worried a lot about you two.

316
00:18:55.337 --> 00:18:58.708
During the retreat during your freshman year in college,

317
00:18:58.708 --> 00:19:01.877
when we went to Daeseong-ri, you two sneaked out...

318
00:19:01.948 --> 00:19:03.877
and I caught you kissing.

319
00:19:05.488 --> 00:19:08.248
I watched you guys for 17 years since.

320
00:19:09.787 --> 00:19:11.817
You have an incredible memory.

321
00:19:12.228 --> 00:19:16.458
You two were doing so well without a hitch but suddenly broke up.

322
00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:19.367
I felt terrible.

323
00:19:20.867 --> 00:19:23.297
You were so hurt at the time,

324
00:19:23.337 --> 00:19:25.137
that I couldn't ask.

325
00:19:26.938 --> 00:19:28.307
Why did you break up?

326
00:19:47.758 --> 00:19:49.027
Why is it here again?

327
00:19:50.327 --> 00:19:51.958
Can't you put it somewhere convenient?

328
00:20:02.408 --> 00:20:03.478
In Ah.

329
00:20:05.208 --> 00:20:06.748
That was there the whole time.

330
00:20:11.918 --> 00:20:13.287
Nothing changed.

331
00:20:15.988 --> 00:20:17.218
Not a thing.

332
00:20:19.428 --> 00:20:20.587
What?

333
00:20:25.258 --> 00:20:26.668
Everything changed.

334
00:20:27.297 --> 00:20:29.867
We fought about the littlest things.

335
00:20:31.268 --> 00:20:34.537
We started to hate even the habits that we liked.

336
00:20:36.337 --> 00:20:39.377
Well... We just got tired of it.

337
00:20:41.377 --> 00:20:43.277
Are you afraid it'll happen again?

338
00:20:44.817 --> 00:20:46.117
Is that why you want to live alone?

339
00:20:47.748 --> 00:20:51.458
Try to meet a nice person. It may be different.

340
00:20:54.787 --> 00:20:55.958
Soo Chul.

341
00:20:57.127 --> 00:21:00.228
Even the person I loved for 17 years couldn't do it.

342
00:21:01.367 --> 00:21:04.367
Why would I make a nice person deal with my problems?

343
00:21:05.198 --> 00:21:06.438
I'll just deal with it alone.

344
00:21:12.008 --> 00:21:13.307
I'm drunk.

345
00:21:23.988 --> 00:21:26.857
There is no way the love will...

346
00:21:31.357 --> 00:21:32.428
I Sang!

347
00:21:37.037 --> 00:21:38.297
You saw me, didn't you?

348
00:21:40.708 --> 00:21:41.768
I did.

349
00:21:43.037 --> 00:21:44.938
Did you just ignore me?

350
00:21:46.448 --> 00:21:48.148
Yes, that's right.

351
00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:49.817
Why?

352
00:21:50.547 --> 00:21:52.387
Can't I do as I please?

353
00:21:55.918 --> 00:21:57.057
You're drunk.

354
00:21:59.287 --> 00:22:00.587
Yes.

355
00:22:00.988 --> 00:22:02.698
Correct.

356
00:22:04.458 --> 00:22:05.827
Oh my gosh.

357
00:22:06.627 --> 00:22:08.297
That's so funny.

358
00:22:09.067 --> 00:22:10.238
My goodness.

359
00:22:26.587 --> 00:22:28.047
Why are you following me?

360
00:22:31.158 --> 00:22:32.758
Because the park is round.

361
00:22:33.087 --> 00:22:34.728
So is Earth.

362
00:22:35.027 --> 00:22:38.398
The Earth is round, so if we keep walking, we'll meet.

363
00:22:41.668 --> 00:22:44.468
- You're drunk. - Don't underestimate my tolerance.

364
00:22:45.037 --> 00:22:46.668
Drunk I Sang.

365
00:22:46.908 --> 00:22:48.837
Can you find your way home okay?

366
00:22:51.577 --> 00:22:53.107
What do you take me for?

367
00:22:59.347 --> 00:23:00.518
So...

368
00:23:01.087 --> 00:23:04.287
what did I do to deserve the "Good Job" stamp?

369
00:23:06.127 --> 00:23:08.087
- What? - I mean...

370
00:23:08.928 --> 00:23:12.367
Be more specific. What exactly did I do...

371
00:23:12.367 --> 00:23:14.827
to receive a compliment?

372
00:23:17.797 --> 00:23:19.067
I Sang.

373
00:23:20.908 --> 00:23:22.137
You're tall...

374
00:23:22.637 --> 00:23:23.877
and handsome.

375
00:23:24.738 --> 00:23:27.408
And you have a good personality.

376
00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:34.018
I'm 41 years old.

377
00:23:34.317 --> 00:23:35.587
I'm not a little kid.

378
00:23:35.857 --> 00:23:37.357
You become funny when you're drunk.

379
00:23:39.087 --> 00:23:40.527
Why don't we drink together?

380
00:23:41.357 --> 00:23:42.597
I want to enjoy this a bit more.

381
00:23:46.728 --> 00:23:47.797
No?

382
00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:50.738
Today,

383
00:23:51.738 --> 00:23:54.438
I need to be alone.

384
00:23:57.537 --> 00:23:58.637
If I stay with you,

385
00:24:02.178 --> 00:24:03.277
something bad might happen.

386
00:24:06.218 --> 00:24:07.817
You don't scare me anymore.

387
00:24:09.287 --> 00:24:10.357
I'll see you.

388
00:24:11.488 --> 00:24:12.557
Bye.

389
00:24:23.498 --> 00:24:25.668
Hello. Her name is Do Ah.

390
00:24:26.008 --> 00:24:27.607
Hi, Do Ah.

391
00:24:28.307 --> 00:24:29.408
- Careful. - Okay.

392
00:24:29.708 --> 00:24:32.337
I'll see you later. Have fun with your teacher, okay?

393
00:24:32.478 --> 00:24:35.948
If you're worried, you can stay and watch since it's her first day.

394
00:24:37.547 --> 00:24:40.248
No, it's okay. We'll have to do this every day from now on.

395
00:24:40.387 --> 00:24:42.117
So she needs to learn to accept that.

396
00:24:43.158 --> 00:24:45.557
Do Ah, don't cry, and be a good girl, okay?

397
00:25:30.938 --> 00:25:32.037
Look!

398
00:25:33.908 --> 00:25:35.037
Do Ah.

399
00:25:38.438 --> 00:25:40.277
She's having fun without me.

400
00:25:41.307 --> 00:25:43.418
Yes, good. What about this one?

401
00:25:44.218 --> 00:25:47.648
I'm glad she's being a good girl, but I do feel a little sad.

402
00:26:29.958 --> 00:26:32.567
- Move it to the left! - Okay.

403
00:26:32.998 --> 00:26:34.428
Move it a bit more.

404
00:26:36.067 --> 00:26:37.137
It looks nice.

405
00:26:48.708 --> 00:26:49.777
Do you think she's doing okay?

406
00:26:50.978 --> 00:26:53.518
- Pardon? - My daughter, Do Ah.

407
00:27:00.027 --> 00:27:01.357
(Resume)

408
00:27:01.357 --> 00:27:03.627
- Ms. Moon Oh Bin? - Yes.

409
00:27:03.857 --> 00:27:06.898
Gosh, you worked at this hospital for a very long time.

410
00:27:07.198 --> 00:27:10.198
Yes, I had to quit because the doctor...

411
00:27:10.198 --> 00:27:11.898
ended up emigrating abroad.

412
00:27:12.037 --> 00:27:13.137
Oh, dear.

413
00:27:13.567 --> 00:27:16.337
I'm going to work here until the day I die.

414
00:27:16.337 --> 00:27:17.678
So you don't need to worry about retirement.

415
00:27:18.877 --> 00:27:19.948
I see.

416
00:27:20.508 --> 00:27:22.918
But I have a question.

417
00:27:23.678 --> 00:27:27.218
Do I also need to take care of your baby?

418
00:27:29.047 --> 00:27:32.387
I raise my kid with the help of technology.

419
00:27:33.287 --> 00:27:34.387
Ta-da.

420
00:27:36.297 --> 00:27:37.357
My goodness.

421
00:27:39.297 --> 00:27:41.968
So you don't need to take care of her.

422
00:27:43.797 --> 00:27:47.107
And once things settle, I'll have her stay at the daycare center.

423
00:27:47.107 --> 00:27:48.367
I plan to take care of her until then.

424
00:27:49.607 --> 00:27:51.478
She doesn't like saying goodbye, does she?

425
00:27:54.648 --> 00:27:55.748
No, it's not that.

426
00:27:57.518 --> 00:27:59.117
I'm the one who can't seem to adjust.

427
00:28:00.418 --> 00:28:01.518
Pardon?

428
00:28:04.218 --> 00:28:05.287
It's no problem.

429
00:28:06.728 --> 00:28:08.988
Gosh, there are so many things to fill out.

430
00:28:10.498 --> 00:28:13.067
I've never gotten a checkup before.

431
00:28:13.067 --> 00:28:15.127
I also had my first checkup after I started working here.

432
00:28:15.797 --> 00:28:17.537
Are you just going to take the basic test?

433
00:28:17.738 --> 00:28:19.938
No, I'm going to check everything.

434
00:28:20.908 --> 00:28:23.238
Excuse me. Can you help me?

435
00:28:25.438 --> 00:28:27.577
What are the extra tests I can take?

436
00:28:28.208 --> 00:28:30.948
If you look here, you can check your brain, heart,

437
00:28:30.948 --> 00:28:32.718
and there's also a male checkup.

438
00:28:32.817 --> 00:28:35.488
Take a look at the list and check the ones you want to get tested.

439
00:28:35.847 --> 00:28:37.418
- Okay, thank you. - Sure.

440
00:28:37.418 --> 00:28:38.488
- Thank you. - No problem.

441
00:28:40.988 --> 00:28:42.627
You should get everything tested.

442
00:28:43.428 --> 00:28:45.327
- Everything? - But there's too many.

443
00:28:46.597 --> 00:28:47.668
Just do it while you're here.

444
00:28:47.668 --> 00:28:48.728
(Gastroscopy, Carotid ultrasound,)

445
00:28:48.728 --> 00:28:49.768
(Echocardiography, Physical strength...)

446
00:28:56.178 --> 00:28:57.577
- Ms. Jang. - Yes?

447
00:29:06.547 --> 00:29:07.988
Hey, hey!

448
00:29:13.188 --> 00:29:14.228
You're all done.

449
00:29:14.387 --> 00:29:16.357
I bet you didn't know she drew your blood because it hurt too much.

450
00:29:19.728 --> 00:29:21.367
But my cheek hurts as well.

451
00:29:23.297 --> 00:29:24.768
Hey, you punk.

452
00:29:26.168 --> 00:29:28.738
What do you think you're doing?

453
00:29:30.537 --> 00:29:33.978
I'm here, you darn jerk.

454
00:29:34.577 --> 00:29:35.847
You fool.

455
00:29:39.718 --> 00:29:42.918
Stop being such a crybaby.

456
00:29:44.787 --> 00:29:46.458
You darn punk.

457
00:29:47.327 --> 00:29:49.087
Mind your own business.

458
00:29:53.127 --> 00:29:54.928
Sperm donation.

459
00:29:57.668 --> 00:30:00.008
- Eu Ddeum, are you okay? - Sperm donation.

460
00:30:03.238 --> 00:30:05.807
What about sperm donation.

461
00:30:07.248 --> 00:30:08.807
It gives hope to couples...

462
00:30:11.948 --> 00:30:13.648
who can't have babies.

463
00:30:15.117 --> 00:30:16.218
My goodness.

464
00:30:20.327 --> 00:30:22.458
I'm kind of nervous about the checkup.

465
00:30:23.057 --> 00:30:24.458
I hope there's nothing wrong with me.

466
00:30:24.958 --> 00:30:26.898
I know we can't ever be sure about your health,

467
00:30:26.898 --> 00:30:28.527
but I bet you're fine.

468
00:30:28.527 --> 00:30:30.037
You could even swallow a stone and you will still be fine.

469
00:30:30.698 --> 00:30:34.337
Once you get the results, will you let me know...

470
00:30:34.508 --> 00:30:36.037
regardless of how good or bad it is?

471
00:30:36.807 --> 00:30:38.208
I'm just worried. That's all.

472
00:30:40.148 --> 00:30:41.948
Sure. I promise I'll tell you.

473
00:30:42.748 --> 00:30:44.418
- You promise? - Yes, I promise.

474
00:31:01.027 --> 00:31:02.367
Ms. Jang!

475
00:31:04.238 --> 00:31:06.408
Everything is normal. I'm really healthy.

476
00:31:06.537 --> 00:31:07.768
I knew it.

477
00:31:08.037 --> 00:31:09.708
And I have something to brag about.

478
00:31:09.777 --> 00:31:12.777
Even the doctor was shocked. He told me this is very rare.

479
00:31:13.807 --> 00:31:16.148
I have 10 times more than the average man.

480
00:31:16.978 --> 00:31:18.047
What are you talking about?

481
00:31:18.047 --> 00:31:19.587
The number of sperm!

482
00:31:24.688 --> 00:31:28.188
(Choi Kang Eu Ddeum)

483
00:31:42.752 --> 00:31:43.962
10 times? My gosh.

484
00:31:44.423 --> 00:31:46.663
What are you going to do with all that sperm?

485
00:31:47.433 --> 00:31:49.133
I didn't expect this either.

486
00:31:49.333 --> 00:31:50.363
So I don't know.

487
00:31:52.502 --> 00:31:54.073
As you know,

488
00:31:54.603 --> 00:31:58.002
we've been doing some research regarding sperm donation.

489
00:31:58.073 --> 00:31:59.873
Oh, right. Sperm donation.

490
00:32:00.472 --> 00:32:01.542
Exactly.

491
00:32:06.482 --> 00:32:07.883
Should I share it with the boss?

492
00:32:12.282 --> 00:32:13.423
Really?

493
00:32:13.923 --> 00:32:16.262
It's not easy to do if you think about it,

494
00:32:16.262 --> 00:32:18.522
but it's also not that difficult.

495
00:32:18.863 --> 00:32:21.732
Comparing it to blood donation might be a stretch,

496
00:32:21.992 --> 00:32:25.002
but it could be done if it's about helping...

497
00:32:25.833 --> 00:32:26.873
one's wish come true.

498
00:32:27.403 --> 00:32:29.133
The donor will stay anonymous,

499
00:32:29.133 --> 00:32:30.943
so it'll be like doing a good deed in secret.

500
00:32:32.242 --> 00:32:34.012
Still, it's not something...

501
00:32:34.413 --> 00:32:36.583
you should easily decide.

502
00:32:37.413 --> 00:32:39.183
I don't have to be a father to the kid,

503
00:32:39.883 --> 00:32:41.653
so consider it as my good deed.

504
00:32:42.782 --> 00:32:45.123
I'm grateful for the offer,

505
00:32:45.353 --> 00:32:46.952
but think about it some more.

506
00:32:47.492 --> 00:32:51.022
It could become a problem when you get married later on.

507
00:32:52.123 --> 00:32:54.393
You might even date someone...

508
00:32:54.393 --> 00:32:56.433
- when I'm pregnant. - Don't you worry.

509
00:32:57.202 --> 00:32:58.663
I don't know about my future wife,

510
00:32:59.633 --> 00:33:01.202
but I'll seek approval from my parents.

511
00:33:01.202 --> 00:33:02.433
What?

512
00:33:03.403 --> 00:33:04.603
Your parents?

513
00:33:05.073 --> 00:33:07.173
I'll be fathering a kid I won't have custody of.

514
00:33:07.472 --> 00:33:08.772
My parents should know.

515
00:33:09.073 --> 00:33:11.242
Right, I guess they should.

516
00:33:11.242 --> 00:33:12.542
Of course.

517
00:33:12.782 --> 00:33:15.413
They'll be having a grandchild they won't know about.

518
00:33:17.323 --> 00:33:19.893
Then they'll be quite shocked.

519
00:33:20.853 --> 00:33:24.062
Exactly. I shouldn't be a part of the kid's life,

520
00:33:24.363 --> 00:33:26.492
so I should ask if my parents could...

521
00:33:27.133 --> 00:33:28.232
forget about the kid too.

522
00:33:31.103 --> 00:33:33.272
- I'll head back inside then. - Sure.

523
00:33:39.073 --> 00:33:40.272
This won't be easy.

524
00:33:47.982 --> 00:33:49.053
Yes, Auntie.

525
00:33:51.923 --> 00:33:55.522
Wait, hold on. Please calm down first.

526
00:33:56.723 --> 00:33:59.763
Please head to the ER and I'll be right there.

527
00:34:00.062 --> 00:34:01.162
Thanks.

528
00:34:13.872 --> 00:34:16.173
Ms. Shim, Mr. Joo is asking for you.

529
00:34:20.283 --> 00:34:21.513
Got it.

530
00:34:21.553 --> 00:34:22.912
(Dachae Media Sales Report)

531
00:34:28.653 --> 00:34:30.162
Only "The Baby"...

532
00:34:30.962 --> 00:34:32.763
reported a down in sales.

533
00:34:34.792 --> 00:34:38.033
You see, the industry is in recession...

534
00:34:39.832 --> 00:34:41.932
(Hubby: The result for our baby is out.)

535
00:34:46.243 --> 00:34:48.642
- Ms. Shim. - Yes?

536
00:34:49.013 --> 00:34:50.883
Now that you're back from your maternity leave,

537
00:34:50.943 --> 00:34:53.053
I'd like you to focus on your department's sales.

538
00:34:53.513 --> 00:34:54.752
It's been doing the worst for the past three years...

539
00:34:54.752 --> 00:34:56.953
and you've been losing your advertisement deals.

540
00:34:57.252 --> 00:35:00.053
Shouldn't you feel responsible?

541
00:35:00.193 --> 00:35:02.522
The journalists and I have been proposing advertisement deals...

542
00:35:02.522 --> 00:35:04.223
just as much as the Advertising Department.

543
00:35:04.263 --> 00:35:06.493
I didn't even take time off to care for my child longer.

544
00:35:06.493 --> 00:35:07.832
You should...

545
00:35:10.062 --> 00:35:11.533
if you're sure you'll be back.

546
00:35:12.462 --> 00:35:15.033
Child-rearing doesn't end with just three months,

547
00:35:15.533 --> 00:35:19.372
so if you don't come back after taking all that time off,

548
00:35:19.712 --> 00:35:21.843
you'll only be costing the company money.

549
00:35:22.243 --> 00:35:25.082
I know, sir. It's why I didn't take time off...

550
00:35:25.082 --> 00:35:26.653
even though I'm entitled to.

551
00:35:27.153 --> 00:35:28.453
You keep suggesting I shouldn't.

552
00:35:31.823 --> 00:35:34.653
Sir, no matter how hard we work,

553
00:35:34.653 --> 00:35:37.993
we can't do anything about the low birthrate or...

554
00:35:37.993 --> 00:35:39.263
Fine.

555
00:35:41.633 --> 00:35:43.062
Anyway,

556
00:35:43.332 --> 00:35:45.633
we were asked to advertise Mureung City.

557
00:35:46.473 --> 00:35:48.033
"The Baby" should take it.

558
00:35:48.602 --> 00:35:50.703
It was originally meant for "The Deco",

559
00:35:50.703 --> 00:35:53.173
but I'm only giving it to you to boost your sales,

560
00:35:53.173 --> 00:35:55.272
so do a good job on it.

561
00:35:55.872 --> 00:35:58.843
If Mureung City is pleased with the outcome,

562
00:35:59.042 --> 00:36:01.613
all the projects from local governments...

563
00:36:02.312 --> 00:36:04.783
will be turned over to "The Baby".

564
00:36:07.053 --> 00:36:09.323
Mr. Joo, my gosh. You were...

565
00:36:09.553 --> 00:36:12.323
only being hard on us to offer us this deal,

566
00:36:12.522 --> 00:36:14.232
but we were too stupid...

567
00:36:14.633 --> 00:36:16.263
to read into your intentions.

568
00:36:16.602 --> 00:36:17.633
Thank you, sir.

569
00:36:20.133 --> 00:36:22.332
It's why being in this position can get lonely.

570
00:36:31.182 --> 00:36:34.453
Seriously? What are you doing here? Go home and have fun.

571
00:36:36.053 --> 00:36:37.752
I don't feel comfortable doing so.

572
00:36:37.923 --> 00:36:39.182
That's your punishment.

573
00:36:39.182 --> 00:36:41.953
I'd rather have fun here while being uncomfortable.

574
00:36:45.223 --> 00:36:48.763
The City of Mureung has asked us to run an advertisement piece.

575
00:36:48.763 --> 00:36:51.133
You'll take the plane there and gather notes for a day.

576
00:36:51.133 --> 00:36:52.962
Other media outlets will be there,

577
00:36:52.962 --> 00:36:56.033
so make sure you come up with a piece...

578
00:36:56.033 --> 00:36:59.443
that blows the minds of the people of Mureung City.

579
00:37:00.073 --> 00:37:01.142
Who wants to go?

580
00:37:03.783 --> 00:37:06.343
My gosh. I covered 15 stories this month.

581
00:37:06.613 --> 00:37:09.153
Well, I'm going to Gangwon Province...

582
00:37:09.153 --> 00:37:10.653
to run a piece on the wholesale warehouse.

583
00:37:10.783 --> 00:37:14.352
Actually, I'd like to ask what our plans are for...

584
00:37:14.553 --> 00:37:16.093
the readers of our first issue.

585
00:37:27.372 --> 00:37:29.533
Ha Ri is terrified to fly.

586
00:37:29.533 --> 00:37:32.573
Exactly. Besides, how can she go when she's been suspended?

587
00:37:32.903 --> 00:37:35.212
She can't since she's out having fun.

588
00:37:41.153 --> 00:37:43.783
Since I've been suspended, I'll write this piece.

589
00:37:46.223 --> 00:37:47.622
I can't go.

590
00:37:48.522 --> 00:37:49.792
Why not?

591
00:37:49.962 --> 00:37:52.763
I made a drunken mistake in front of Ms. Jang.

592
00:37:55.732 --> 00:37:57.033
No way.

593
00:37:59.932 --> 00:38:01.173
You showed her your cute side?

594
00:38:10.542 --> 00:38:11.613
You idiot!

595
00:38:12.743 --> 00:38:15.553
How can you look Ms. Jang in the eyes now?

596
00:38:18.423 --> 00:38:20.392
The embarrassment might just kill me,

597
00:38:21.252 --> 00:38:22.653
but I'll try and hang in there.

598
00:38:23.093 --> 00:38:25.292
The photos are important for this piece...

599
00:38:25.562 --> 00:38:27.892
so they need an expert photographer,

600
00:38:27.892 --> 00:38:29.462
but I busted my arm.

601
00:38:29.732 --> 00:38:31.962
I can't bring in the money with a busted arm...

602
00:38:32.232 --> 00:38:33.703
which means I can't hire a freelancer.

603
00:38:33.973 --> 00:38:35.203
Unbelievable.

604
00:38:35.533 --> 00:38:38.243
- I'll have to give up the studio. - That's enough.

605
00:38:38.243 --> 00:38:40.013
I can't look Ms. Jang in the eyes anymore.

606
00:38:42.042 --> 00:38:43.343
This is all on you now!

607
00:38:50.323 --> 00:38:53.522
Mr. Nam, the photographer hasn't contacted me yet.

608
00:38:53.792 --> 00:38:55.392
Don't tell me you still haven't hired one.

609
00:38:55.453 --> 00:38:57.093
He'll be there somewhere.

610
00:38:57.323 --> 00:38:59.892
He's your partner, so look around.

611
00:39:00.633 --> 00:39:02.693
What? My partner?

612
00:39:03.232 --> 00:39:04.232
What the...

613
00:39:09.133 --> 00:39:10.303
I found him.

614
00:39:29.223 --> 00:39:30.323
Shall we?

615
00:39:30.723 --> 00:39:33.593
Why didn't you call to say you were joining me?

616
00:39:34.162 --> 00:39:35.633
We could've carpooled.

617
00:39:36.803 --> 00:39:38.832
- Do you want this? - No.

618
00:39:40.133 --> 00:39:42.772
How about buttered squid or beef jerky?

619
00:39:42.973 --> 00:39:44.142
I'm good.

620
00:39:46.142 --> 00:39:48.073
How about we grab a drink afterward?

621
00:39:48.173 --> 00:39:50.843
I like how alcohol makes you cute and sincere.

622
00:39:50.912 --> 00:39:52.343
Can't I do as I please?

623
00:39:52.682 --> 00:39:54.013
Yes.

624
00:39:54.013 --> 00:39:55.582
Correct.

625
00:39:58.022 --> 00:39:59.122
This isn't a vacation, you know.

626
00:39:59.582 --> 00:40:01.453
But it's still a trip.

627
00:40:01.723 --> 00:40:04.723
What's so bad about buying snacks and getting in the mood?

628
00:40:05.363 --> 00:40:06.622
We're even getting on a plane.

629
00:40:08.863 --> 00:40:10.863
Unbelievable. I hate planes.

630
00:40:15.073 --> 00:40:17.843
But we're not going...

631
00:40:17.843 --> 00:40:20.042
on a vacation though.

632
00:40:20.343 --> 00:40:22.573
So you don't want any snacks?

633
00:40:28.412 --> 00:40:29.982
Isn't that a bit too much?

634
00:40:37.792 --> 00:40:39.763
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

635
00:40:40.332 --> 00:40:42.932
We welcome you on our flight.

636
00:40:43.432 --> 00:40:46.432
The flight attendants are here to make sure you have...

637
00:40:46.432 --> 00:40:47.973
- a safe journey. - Are you all right?

638
00:40:49.073 --> 00:40:51.943
I just get nervous before the plane takes off.

639
00:40:51.943 --> 00:40:54.073
I'll be fine once we're in the air.

640
00:40:56.212 --> 00:40:57.982
You're not sick or anything, right?

641
00:40:57.982 --> 00:40:58.982
- I'm good. - Thank you for...

642
00:40:58.982 --> 00:41:02.153
your cooperation and we hope...

643
00:42:10.252 --> 00:42:11.383
Hello.

644
00:42:11.383 --> 00:42:12.923
- Hello. - Hello.

645
00:42:16.693 --> 00:42:18.823
Did Ha Ri not come with you?

646
00:42:18.892 --> 00:42:21.693
Ha Ri went on a business trip to Mureung City with Mr. Han.

647
00:42:22.863 --> 00:42:25.332
To that very far city of Mureung...

648
00:42:25.562 --> 00:42:29.102
alone with Mr. Han, with no other staff members.

649
00:42:32.573 --> 00:42:33.712
They went together.

650
00:42:35.812 --> 00:42:38.443
What are they doing there, that they went...

651
00:42:39.142 --> 00:42:40.212
by themselves?

652
00:42:40.912 --> 00:42:43.582
What a load of crock.

653
00:42:47.252 --> 00:42:50.693
Ladies and gentlemen, the pilot has turned off the seat belt sign.

654
00:42:51.093 --> 00:42:54.133
However, because there may be turbulence,

655
00:42:54.133 --> 00:42:57.033
please keep your seat belts on when you are seated.

656
00:42:57.763 --> 00:43:00.062
When the seat belt light is on,

657
00:43:00.062 --> 00:43:03.673
we will not be serving food and beverages for safety reasons.

658
00:43:05.142 --> 00:43:06.843
- Oh dear. - Oh my gosh.

659
00:43:07.142 --> 00:43:08.743
Are you okay, sir?

660
00:44:01.732 --> 00:44:03.832
Maybe he could be the one...

661
00:44:05.033 --> 00:44:06.102
Is it him?

662
00:44:07.173 --> 00:44:08.573
The bus that I missed.

663
00:44:10.443 --> 00:44:11.502
This always happens.

664
00:44:11.642 --> 00:44:13.073
Especially when I'm late for an important appointment,

665
00:44:13.173 --> 00:44:15.073
the bus won't show up.

666
00:44:15.872 --> 00:44:19.212
If I hop in a cab to save time, we get stuck in traffic,

667
00:44:19.582 --> 00:44:22.013
and the bus I was waiting for...

668
00:44:22.013 --> 00:44:24.182
speeds along in the bus express lane.

669
00:44:25.383 --> 00:44:27.392
If my impatience took control,

670
00:44:27.392 --> 00:44:29.792
and made me miss a destined meeting,

671
00:44:31.522 --> 00:44:32.693
will I...

672
00:44:33.863 --> 00:44:37.133
regret not holding his hand later on?

673
00:44:52.542 --> 00:44:55.812
Why won't this open?

674
00:44:56.482 --> 00:44:57.622
Gosh.

675
00:44:59.352 --> 00:45:00.522
It opened easily.

676
00:45:01.022 --> 00:45:02.792
They made it well. You know...

677
00:45:04.022 --> 00:45:06.622
- Do you want this? - No.

678
00:45:07.133 --> 00:45:08.193
Okay.

679
00:45:11.403 --> 00:45:12.633
Sir.

680
00:45:16.903 --> 00:45:18.002
Thank you.

681
00:45:21.113 --> 00:45:23.982
I was giving you my handkerchief, not my hand.

682
00:45:25.082 --> 00:45:27.812
Yes, handkerchief.

683
00:45:37.022 --> 00:45:38.462
- What? - Hey, Ha Ri.

684
00:45:38.763 --> 00:45:40.892
Should I keep my lab coat on or take it off?

685
00:45:41.792 --> 00:45:43.562
Why are you asking me about you taking clothes off?

686
00:45:44.962 --> 00:45:47.173
- Ask the reporter there. - What?

687
00:45:47.932 --> 00:45:49.203
Both look good?

688
00:45:49.272 --> 00:45:51.203
Stop joking around. You're embarrassing me.

689
00:45:51.473 --> 00:45:53.973
Okay. Should I take the pictures with or without?

690
00:45:53.973 --> 00:45:55.743
Take it off if you want. I don't care.

691
00:45:56.743 --> 00:45:57.812
Gosh.

692
00:45:58.542 --> 00:45:59.943
It's better with it on?

693
00:46:00.283 --> 00:46:02.453
Okay, got it. Work hard.

694
00:46:03.513 --> 00:46:04.852
She says I look good with it on.

695
00:46:04.982 --> 00:46:06.653
Okay.

696
00:46:08.193 --> 00:46:09.252
Gosh.

697
00:46:11.662 --> 00:46:14.133
- Was that Dr. Yoon Jae Young? - Yes.

698
00:46:19.803 --> 00:46:21.033
What is it this time?

699
00:46:21.133 --> 00:46:23.473
Should I sit or stand for the picture?

700
00:46:23.943 --> 00:46:27.212
It would be better standing by the window looking cool. right?

701
00:46:27.212 --> 00:46:30.482
It'll bet better seated at my desk so that my nameplate shows.

702
00:46:31.682 --> 00:46:33.013
Sit for the photo...

703
00:46:33.312 --> 00:46:34.453
and cover your gut.

704
00:46:37.823 --> 00:46:40.752
Sure, got it. Okay. Work hard.

705
00:46:43.693 --> 00:46:44.792
Let's start.

706
00:46:51.962 --> 00:46:53.602
What? Why? What? What?

707
00:46:53.602 --> 00:46:55.732
Should I smile or not?

708
00:46:55.732 --> 00:46:57.303
It's best not smiling, right?

709
00:46:57.303 --> 00:46:59.642
To look serious and professional.

710
00:46:59.943 --> 00:47:01.743
No. Smiling may be better.

711
00:47:01.743 --> 00:47:03.312
This is a local hospital.

712
00:47:03.312 --> 00:47:06.113
So it'll be better to look friendly.

713
00:47:06.312 --> 00:47:08.883
Just shut your trap and take the picture, you punk.

714
00:47:14.122 --> 00:47:15.193
Okay.

715
00:47:15.193 --> 00:47:17.522
I look great both ways? What?

716
00:47:17.923 --> 00:47:19.723
Enough, Ha Ri.

717
00:47:26.432 --> 00:47:27.533
Doctor.

718
00:47:29.533 --> 00:47:31.173
It'll be this big.

719
00:47:33.203 --> 00:47:34.973
(My child whines if I don't let her watch on my smartphone.)

720
00:47:37.283 --> 00:47:38.412
That won't be easy.

721
00:47:39.843 --> 00:47:42.412
Mureung is named that because there are no royal tombs.

722
00:47:42.412 --> 00:47:44.522
In order to hide the location of the kings' graves,

723
00:47:44.852 --> 00:47:47.022
they built fake graves here.

724
00:47:47.022 --> 00:47:49.593
There is a legend that a dragon rose from there.

725
00:47:49.823 --> 00:47:51.962
So the saying goes.

726
00:47:53.093 --> 00:47:55.162
- Take all the pictures you want. - Thank you.

727
00:47:58.562 --> 00:47:59.803
Should I take some that way?

728
00:48:01.303 --> 00:48:02.303
I think it'll look good.

729
00:48:04.002 --> 00:48:05.102
Here.

730
00:48:05.403 --> 00:48:06.473
Excuse me.

731
00:48:30.903 --> 00:48:32.062
- Okay, good. - Good?

732
00:48:34.272 --> 00:48:35.372
Shall we go?

733
00:48:38.443 --> 00:48:42.312
Okay. The official schedule for the day is over.

734
00:48:42.312 --> 00:48:44.082
Feel free to take more pictures.

735
00:48:44.283 --> 00:48:46.912
If you want to hang out more, feel free to do that as well.

736
00:48:47.142 --> 00:48:48.812
Thank you, everyone.

737
00:48:48.812 --> 00:48:49.982
- Thank you. - Sure.

738
00:48:53.352 --> 00:48:56.752
Ha Ri. Don't you think we need something better for the main shot?

739
00:48:56.953 --> 00:48:59.993
Right? Should we take some pictures of the sunset?

740
00:49:06.803 --> 00:49:08.533
Is Ha Ri not back yet?

741
00:49:08.903 --> 00:49:11.203
She went to Mureung. She'll probably be home late.

742
00:49:11.272 --> 00:49:12.903
- Come eat. - Auntie.

743
00:49:13.343 --> 00:49:14.613
The photographer is a man.

744
00:49:14.712 --> 00:49:16.712
What if something happens while they're alone together?

745
00:49:17.812 --> 00:49:18.912
Like what?

746
00:49:20.513 --> 00:49:21.682
Something frightening.

747
00:49:29.093 --> 00:49:32.792
I wonder if we needed to rent a car just to go take one picture.

748
00:49:33.562 --> 00:49:35.593
You said your pride is on the line.

749
00:49:36.593 --> 00:49:38.062
It'll say, "Photo by Han I Sang."

750
00:49:38.662 --> 00:49:40.102
So my pride is on the line too.

751
00:49:41.102 --> 00:49:42.372
Even if I did refuse to do this,

752
00:49:42.573 --> 00:49:44.642
I've never given less than 100 percent.

753
00:49:46.903 --> 00:49:48.013
I know.

754
00:49:50.312 --> 00:49:51.843
Will we have enough time?

755
00:49:56.682 --> 00:49:58.783
We can make our flight if we rush.

756
00:49:59.453 --> 00:50:00.522
Okay.

757
00:50:38.823 --> 00:50:41.593
How about this for your explanation of Mureung City?

758
00:50:51.073 --> 00:50:52.173
What?

759
00:50:53.502 --> 00:50:56.312
You're the first photographer to takes pictures...

760
00:50:57.073 --> 00:50:58.482
with the article in mind.

761
00:51:02.712 --> 00:51:03.783
It's perfect.

762
00:51:06.752 --> 00:51:09.093
- Should we take a few more? - Okay.

763
00:51:11.223 --> 00:51:13.363
She went there for work. What could possibly happen?

764
00:51:13.522 --> 00:51:17.263
She went on multi-day business trips with men, and nothing happened.

765
00:51:17.533 --> 00:51:19.303
What if something happens this time?

766
00:51:19.903 --> 00:51:22.203
You've heard of incidents like that.

767
00:51:22.502 --> 00:51:24.602
You work like crazy and miss the train.

768
00:51:24.803 --> 00:51:27.102
You look for a place to stay, and there's only one.

769
00:51:27.272 --> 00:51:30.412
Furthermore, they have one vacant room.

770
00:51:31.283 --> 00:51:34.653
I hate these cliche and offensive things...

771
00:51:35.182 --> 00:51:36.352
so much.

772
00:51:36.352 --> 00:51:39.883
Why couldn't she come home just because there's no train?

773
00:51:40.582 --> 00:51:43.593
- Right? - Unless there is a rainstorm...

774
00:51:43.852 --> 00:51:44.993
What?

775
00:51:51.703 --> 00:51:52.863
It looks like rain.

776
00:51:53.462 --> 00:51:54.573
Rain?

777
00:51:57.173 --> 00:51:59.002
They can't go anywhere, and it's raining.

778
00:51:59.002 --> 00:52:00.973
Their clothes are drenched, and they become chilly.

779
00:52:01.142 --> 00:52:03.573
And the boiler at the inn is broken.

780
00:52:03.573 --> 00:52:05.182
They need to be in a situation where they can't help...

781
00:52:05.182 --> 00:52:06.783
but share each other's body temperature.

782
00:52:06.783 --> 00:52:10.283
That's when something will finally happen. You know nothing.

783
00:52:13.153 --> 00:52:14.522
I don't even want to think about it.

784
00:52:32.842 --> 00:52:34.242
Our flight got canceled.

785
00:52:35.412 --> 00:52:37.041
The express bus drivers are on a strike,

786
00:52:37.041 --> 00:52:38.642
and the train tickets are all sold out.

787
00:52:41.412 --> 00:52:42.452
What should we do?

788
00:52:44.421 --> 00:52:46.282
We'll just have to borrow the car for a bit longer.

789
00:52:46.751 --> 00:52:48.222
We can't take the plane home anyway.

790
00:52:48.952 --> 00:52:50.521
Do you think we'll be able to go home?

791
00:52:50.762 --> 00:52:53.691
As long as the road doesn't get blocked due to a landslide,

792
00:52:54.021 --> 00:52:55.191
we'll be able to go home.

793
00:52:55.432 --> 00:52:56.662
Don't worry.

794
00:53:02.671 --> 00:53:05.371
We have breaking news. Due to the heavy rain in the southwest,

795
00:53:05.371 --> 00:53:07.811
a landslide has occurred in Mureung City...

796
00:53:08.012 --> 00:53:10.012
which ended up blocking the nearby coastal road.

797
00:53:10.012 --> 00:53:12.742
The authorities have sent people to urgently clear up the road,

798
00:53:12.742 --> 00:53:15.851
and they announced that it'll take around six hours.

799
00:53:15.981 --> 00:53:17.521
We will update you...

800
00:53:17.521 --> 00:53:19.081
- as soon as we hear more. - She can't be there, right?

801
00:53:19.081 --> 00:53:20.581
- We will move onto the next news. - No way.

802
00:53:27.222 --> 00:53:29.461
How is this even possible?

803
00:53:29.992 --> 00:53:32.202
How can this happen?

804
00:53:32.362 --> 00:53:33.862
It's like someone planned this.

805
00:53:34.671 --> 00:53:36.932
Are you saying I planned this?

806
00:53:37.001 --> 00:53:39.371
You were the one who suggested that we should come here.

807
00:53:39.572 --> 00:53:41.612
I knew something was weird when you insisted on...

808
00:53:41.612 --> 00:53:44.941
renting a car just so we could come all the way here.

809
00:53:44.981 --> 00:53:47.211
I can't believe you used the main cut as bait.

810
00:53:47.282 --> 00:53:49.282
It was a great idea. You totally fooled me.

811
00:53:49.782 --> 00:53:51.882
Will you stop talking nonsense?

812
00:53:52.021 --> 00:53:55.392
Then are you saying I caused the landslide?

813
00:53:55.392 --> 00:53:58.222
No, but you could've seen the weather forecast.

814
00:53:58.621 --> 00:54:01.961
Isn't it more plausible to say you created this scenario?

815
00:54:02.561 --> 00:54:06.101
No, I'm very up to date when it comes to romance.

816
00:54:06.302 --> 00:54:08.671
This kind of stuff doesn't even happen in dramas.

817
00:54:09.072 --> 00:54:11.671
This kind of scenario is for people who are lame...

818
00:54:11.671 --> 00:54:13.171
just like you.

819
00:54:13.401 --> 00:54:14.512
What? "Lame"?

820
00:54:14.811 --> 00:54:16.342
Are you seriously going to blame it on me?

821
00:54:16.342 --> 00:54:18.081
We'll soon find out.

822
00:54:18.481 --> 00:54:20.311
You just wait and see.

823
00:54:20.311 --> 00:54:22.882
We'll end up going to a bed and breakfast...

824
00:54:22.882 --> 00:54:24.552
that's run by an old lady.

825
00:54:26.822 --> 00:54:28.592
(Bed and Breakfast)

826
00:54:28.592 --> 00:54:29.851
Hello?

827
00:54:31.521 --> 00:54:32.662
Is anyone here?

828
00:54:33.662 --> 00:54:36.262
Is this the only place you could find?

829
00:54:36.262 --> 00:54:39.561
You saw the map as well. This was the only bed and breakfast.

830
00:54:39.762 --> 00:54:41.901
Exactly. It's weird that you drove to a place...

831
00:54:41.901 --> 00:54:45.142
where there's only one bed and breakfast.

832
00:54:49.342 --> 00:54:50.512
Is no one here?

833
00:54:51.142 --> 00:54:52.581
Are you here...

834
00:54:53.441 --> 00:54:56.851
to stay the night?

835
00:54:59.021 --> 00:55:00.581
Yes, we're here to stay the night.

836
00:55:02.521 --> 00:55:04.862
I bet she'll say there's only one room left.

837
00:55:04.862 --> 00:55:06.961
There are three rooms.

838
00:55:08.231 --> 00:55:10.461
But do you only need one room?

839
00:55:12.561 --> 00:55:14.771
You can rent an entire annex.

840
00:55:15.972 --> 00:55:18.001
We'll... We'll pay for the annex.

841
00:55:18.001 --> 00:55:20.101
We'll take a room each.

842
00:55:20.302 --> 00:55:22.912
And she'll even use the extra room.

843
00:55:23.642 --> 00:55:26.412
We'll sleep separately...

844
00:55:26.412 --> 00:55:28.182
and make sure we don't even touch.

845
00:55:30.151 --> 00:55:33.751
Do as you wish.

846
00:55:34.121 --> 00:55:35.751
Okay. Thank you.

847
00:55:36.092 --> 00:55:37.092
Thank you.

848
00:55:42.061 --> 00:55:44.632
I guess we need to use that to cook our own rice.

849
00:55:44.632 --> 00:55:45.932
I guess so.

850
00:55:45.961 --> 00:55:48.871
But do you think you can sleep here?

851
00:55:49.271 --> 00:55:50.901
I'll just sleep in the car.

852
00:55:51.601 --> 00:55:54.171
- No, I'll sleep in the car. - Here.

853
00:55:56.211 --> 00:55:57.941
You can change into this.

854
00:55:59.382 --> 00:56:00.811
Okay.

855
00:56:01.552 --> 00:56:02.782
You're so kind.

856
00:56:04.351 --> 00:56:05.481
We'll get changed.

857
00:56:09.322 --> 00:56:11.822
- The phone is turned off. - Ha Ri isn't home yet.

858
00:56:12.592 --> 00:56:13.722
Her phone's turned off as well.

859
00:56:13.722 --> 00:56:16.432
She told me she's low on battery. She can't come home tonight.

860
00:56:16.592 --> 00:56:17.731
She's going to sleep outside?

861
00:56:18.702 --> 00:56:20.302
She's with Mr. Han, isn't she?

862
00:56:21.271 --> 00:56:24.572
Are you going to let your daughter spend the night with a guy?

863
00:56:24.742 --> 00:56:26.972
You should go there and drag her home.

864
00:56:27.811 --> 00:56:30.412
I'm actually glad that my daughter's spending the night with a guy.

865
00:56:30.941 --> 00:56:32.541
What kind of guy is he?

866
00:56:32.742 --> 00:56:34.811
Is he normal? How old is he? Does he have his own house?

867
00:56:34.811 --> 00:56:35.851
Is he diligent?

868
00:56:38.282 --> 00:56:41.121
He doesn't own anything, and he's very old.

869
00:56:41.351 --> 00:56:44.222
On top of that, he looks very scary. He has really dark skin.

870
00:56:45.362 --> 00:56:47.162
He's a weirdo. I don't like him.

871
00:56:47.992 --> 00:56:49.932
Then why don't you marry Ha Ri?

872
00:56:52.662 --> 00:56:55.702
I'm just worried about her like an older brother.

873
00:56:55.702 --> 00:56:56.871
Don't take it out on me.

874
00:56:58.101 --> 00:57:00.541
An older brother, my foot. You were born a month later.

875
00:57:00.702 --> 00:57:04.271
Wait until she comes home. I'll teach that brat a lesson.

876
00:57:07.882 --> 00:57:09.552
The phone doesn't work here.

877
00:58:07.771 --> 00:58:11.081
I Sang, you're like a country boy.

878
00:58:11.142 --> 00:58:12.782
What are you talking about?

879
00:58:13.081 --> 00:58:16.012
People think I'm from abroad. They call me Kevin.

880
00:58:16.751 --> 00:58:17.822
Daniel.

881
00:58:18.021 --> 00:58:19.081
Sure.

882
00:58:28.892 --> 00:58:31.302
Why are you burning firewood?

883
00:58:31.961 --> 00:58:33.802
We have a stove.

884
00:58:35.671 --> 00:58:39.072
It's an induction stove. Is that why you couldn't find it?

885
00:58:40.802 --> 00:58:42.371
We saw an iron cauldron.

886
00:58:43.371 --> 00:58:45.012
I put that there to make the place look nice.

887
00:58:49.952 --> 00:58:51.521
Did you cook rice?

888
00:58:51.751 --> 00:58:53.621
We provide meals for our guests.

889
00:58:53.851 --> 00:58:56.452
We bring it all the way to your room like a hotel room service.

890
00:58:57.961 --> 00:59:01.132
You guys are very old-fashioned.

891
00:59:09.901 --> 00:59:11.501
It's nice and warm.

892
00:59:13.202 --> 00:59:15.512
Here's your coffee.

893
00:59:16.171 --> 00:59:17.472
- Thank you. - No problem.

894
00:59:18.882 --> 00:59:20.382
I've never had coffee in a bowl.

895
00:59:21.211 --> 00:59:22.452
Bowl coffee.

896
00:59:26.651 --> 00:59:30.421
I Sang, how did you end up doing photography?

897
00:59:31.362 --> 00:59:34.691
My dad used to enjoy taking photos.

898
00:59:35.132 --> 00:59:36.831
I used to follow my dad to the photo studio...

899
00:59:36.831 --> 00:59:38.532
every time he went there to get his photos printed out.

900
00:59:38.932 --> 00:59:41.061
Then I'd follow him again once the photos were ready.

901
00:59:41.632 --> 00:59:43.271
I enjoyed doing that.

902
00:59:44.941 --> 00:59:47.441
I guess that's why your photos are always so warm.

903
00:59:52.311 --> 00:59:54.282
Your photos are just like you.

904
00:59:58.722 --> 01:00:01.452
Back in the past, we had to wait...

905
01:00:01.452 --> 01:00:03.052
until the photos came out.

906
01:00:03.952 --> 01:00:06.492
It was exciting to wait for them.

907
01:00:07.421 --> 01:00:09.731
It's just like how I can't wait to find out...

908
01:00:10.162 --> 01:00:11.932
what will happen tomorrow.

909
01:00:15.032 --> 01:00:17.171
I'm more curious about today.

910
01:00:20.101 --> 01:00:23.512
I wonder how we'll end up spending the night together.

911
01:00:52.871 --> 01:00:54.271
It's good, right?

912
01:01:06.921 --> 01:01:08.691
- Are you done washing up? - Yes.

913
01:01:08.851 --> 01:01:10.892
Well, I was just about to wash up myself.

914
01:01:11.561 --> 01:01:12.561
I see.

915
01:01:14.222 --> 01:01:16.162
Do they have hot water?

916
01:01:16.532 --> 01:01:18.132
Yes, lots of it.

917
01:01:19.331 --> 01:01:21.802
Right. Good night then.

918
01:01:23.001 --> 01:01:25.142
- Good night. - You too.

919
01:03:13.682 --> 01:03:19.382
(Mr. Han, are you awake?)

920
01:03:22.851 --> 01:03:24.222
(Mr. Han, are you awake?)

921
01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:48.612
Mr. Han!

922
01:04:50.041 --> 01:04:51.512
What are you doing over there?

923
01:05:05.822 --> 01:05:06.892
What is it?

924
01:05:07.862 --> 01:05:08.961
Just a second.

925
01:05:11.362 --> 01:05:13.862
Why are you whispering?

926
01:05:26.711 --> 01:05:27.811
Wait.

927
01:05:41.532 --> 01:05:42.632
This looks so cool.

928
01:06:04.481 --> 01:06:06.151
Gosh, the wind.

929
01:06:08.492 --> 01:06:09.992
My hair's all over the place.

930
01:06:14.561 --> 01:06:16.762
- What a windy day. - What?

931
01:06:24.532 --> 01:06:27.941
Being a big guy, I'm sure you can block the wind for me...

932
01:08:10.371 --> 01:08:12.111
(The herbal infertility treatment introduced in the first episode...)

933
01:08:12.111 --> 01:08:14.182
(was only fabricated for the purpose of the show.)

934
01:08:14.281 --> 01:08:17.152
(Oh My Baby)

935
01:08:17.152 --> 01:08:18.722
You spend the night with him,

936
01:08:18.722 --> 01:08:20.652
but you're telling me you are in a meeting?

937
01:08:20.852 --> 01:08:21.951
Sorry about that.

938
01:08:21.951 --> 01:08:23.951
Why are you apologizing? It's even more annoying.

939
01:08:23.951 --> 01:08:25.421
You need to be wise when choosing men.

940
01:08:25.421 --> 01:08:27.961
Don't be swooned by what you see on the outside.

941
01:08:27.961 --> 01:08:30.092
- You... - I don't need you to protect me.

942
01:08:30.291 --> 01:08:32.562
I'm 39, not 19.

943
01:08:32.632 --> 01:08:34.632
Shouldn't you explain yourself?

944
01:08:34.632 --> 01:08:37.302
I'll start by saying we live under the same roof.

945
01:08:37.302 --> 01:08:39.701
Being this small should be a crime since it makes you...

946
01:08:39.701 --> 01:08:41.642
snugly fit in my embrace.

947
01:08:42.972 --> 01:08:44.342
How do you think of me as a woman?

948
01:08:46.342 --> 01:08:47.411
What?
