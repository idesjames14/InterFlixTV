00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:41.320
It's so windy.

2
00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:43.619
We should go back inside.

3
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.270
Okay.

4
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.680
Was I supposed to kiss him?

5
00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:07.320
No, he turned away.

6
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.729
"Start flirting with other guys..."

7
00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.430
"so he'll think it was a joke."

(How to seduce a man if you failed already.)

9
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.630
No, this one doesn't sound right.

10
00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:35.309
"Act like nothing ever happened."

11
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.609
No, I don't think I can do that.

(Jae Young)

13
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.089
(I'm in a meeting.)

14
00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:46.420
(I'm in a meeting. I'll call you back soon.)

15
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.559
"A meeting"?

16
00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.960
You can't be back yet, and you're in a meeting?

17
00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.129
You spent the night with him, and you say you're in a meeting?

18
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.569
(Give it one more try and hit on him properly.)

19
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.670
"Give it one more try and hit on him properly."

20
00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:03.839
- What? - What?

21
00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.369
What? What's the matter?

22
00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.680
What? What do you mean? What did I do?

23
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.050
What... I... I'm sorry.

24
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.119
I think I heard something.

25
00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.379
I didn't say anything.

26
00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.249
Didn't you say you're going to do something properly?

27
00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:18.819
No, I really didn't say anything.

28
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.990
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:25.360
Why? Did you do something to upset me?

30
00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:28.360
No... No.

31
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.969
- I'm sorry. - You just apologized again.

32
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.539
Why do you keep apologizing? You're starting to offend me.

33
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.510
- I'm sorry. - Hey!

34
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.770
What?

35
00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:46.610
I think we should just be quiet.

36
00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:49.879
Okay.

37
00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:09.200
You can drop me off over there.

38
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.939
I'll...

39
00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:14.279
I'll drive you to your house.

40
00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:16.110
- It's okay. - No, I'll just get off here.

41
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.930
Hey.

42
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.439
Do you like guys by any chance?

43
00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:45.939
What?

44
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.609
How... Don't I look...

45
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:52.849
pretty straight?

46
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.950
Well, I just thought you might be single...

47
00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:58.789
because of that.

48
00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.089
I totally respect people's different sexual orientations.

49
00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:06.460
Well, I don't like guys.

50
00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:07.830
Okay.

51
00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:11.969
By the way,

52
00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:16.469
I hope my apology...

53
00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.010
doesn't end up keeping you awake at night.

54
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.880
Good night.

55
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:33.789
Good night.

56
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:22.700
Oh, my gosh!

57
00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:27.140
Are you crazy? What are you doing there?

58
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.779
What took you so long to come home?

59
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.750
Were you with Mr. Han all day?

60
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:34.849
I'm tired. Save the nagging for tomorrow.

61
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.120
Why did you spend the night? I thought it was a day trip.

62
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.060
I know, right? I can't believe I spent the night.

63
00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:48.359
You're starting to go a little crazy these days.

64
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.299
Don't tell me you slept with him yesterday.

65
00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:54.640
Maybe I should've.

66
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:55.900
Are you serious?

67
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:00.739
Hey.

68
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.979
How do you think of me as a woman?

69
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:08.049
What?

70
00:07:09.049 --> 00:07:10.419
- Am I unattractive? - No.

71
00:07:17.089 --> 00:07:18.859
You're not unattractive.

72
00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.659
Right?

73
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.370
If you flirt with a guy, and he shows no reaction,

74
00:07:24.929 --> 00:07:26.870
he's probably a priest, a monk,

75
00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:29.900
or asexual.

76
00:07:32.739 --> 00:07:33.810
Right.

77
00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:38.479
What's the meaning behind that smile?

78
00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:40.479
You need to be wise when choosing men.

79
00:07:40.479 --> 00:07:43.679
Don't be swooned by what you see on the outside. Okay?

80
00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:45.489
Ha Ri.

81
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.659
What in the world happened between them?

82
00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:08.810
I should've kissed her, right?

83
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:21.760
I mean, come on.

84
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.390
It wouldn't have been a bad idea to kiss her, right?

85
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:27.089
No? You think it's wrong?

86
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.560
Forget it.

87
00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:40.669
(Good job!)

88
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:45.210
(Episode 5: Hard to Hide Our Feelings)

89
00:08:53.989 --> 00:08:55.820
My gosh, go away if you don't want to eat.

90
00:08:56.289 --> 00:08:58.089
Give it back to me right now.

91
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:59.589
You can't eat bibimbap without a fried egg.

92
00:08:59.589 --> 00:09:01.000
What makes you think you deserve this?

93
00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:02.630
Do you have a death wish?

94
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:05.299
My gosh, here's another one.

95
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.039
Seeing him eat just made me lose my appetite.

96
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.270
Will you two stop? You're both too old for this.

97
00:09:13.569 --> 00:09:15.340
You make a great couple,

98
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.709
so why won't you get together already?

99
00:09:17.709 --> 00:09:20.110
- Why would I... - Auntie, I'm eating.

100
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.520
- What you said is disgusting. - I might throw up.

101
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.049
Shut it, the both of you.

102
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:28.059
What are you looking at?

103
00:09:28.059 --> 00:09:30.020
Gosh, the letters are so tiny.

104
00:09:30.419 --> 00:09:33.059
- Can you send a text for me? - Sure.

105
00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:34.159
"Got it."

106
00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:38.970
(Got it.)

107
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:39.970
Did you send it?

108
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.740
Is your mountaineering club going somewhere?

109
00:09:42.169 --> 00:09:43.900
An overnight trip to the East Sea.

110
00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:45.640
- An overnight trip? - Gosh.

111
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.480
Are you sure you're going as a group?

112
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.510
Who's the mystery guy?

113
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.980
Should I get ready to be shocked?

114
00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:53.449
No, but brace yourself for a smack.

115
00:09:53.709 --> 00:09:55.919
- It hurts. - You should focus...

116
00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:57.380
on your dating life, not mine.

117
00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.459
Well, I'm looking for a donor...

118
00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:03.159
who isn't embarrassed.

119
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.329
You failed to find an ordinary guy to marry,

120
00:10:05.529 --> 00:10:08.130
so I doubt the search will get you anywhere.

121
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.929
Mom, don't forget to buy squid!

122
00:10:21.539 --> 00:10:24.510
Do you know when voters show the most hostility to politicians?

123
00:10:24.809 --> 00:10:26.209
What are you getting at?

124
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.480
It's when they don't live up to their promises.

125
00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:31.189
They shouldn't promise a better economy...

126
00:10:31.189 --> 00:10:32.689
and receive bribes to fill their own pockets.

127
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.620
So?

128
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.459
Keep that in mind.

129
00:10:38.789 --> 00:10:41.329
You're searching for a sperm donor, not a husband.

130
00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.100
I'm fully supportive of you,

131
00:10:43.329 --> 00:10:46.230
so don't go back on your promise, Ha Ri.

132
00:10:48.199 --> 00:10:49.270
Just get back to your meal.

133
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.470
Sure. Why not?

134
00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:55.709
Eat quietly.

135
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.709
This is the quietest I've ever been while eating.

136
00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:02.480
You're so annoying.

137
00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.919
So when you called Ha Ri the other day,

138
00:11:06.919 --> 00:11:09.090
she said she couldn't come home because of a landslide?

139
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.760
I saw the expenses report she handed in earlier...

140
00:11:12.289 --> 00:11:13.789
and she booked herself a room.

141
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.260
- Then they slept together. - Many babies are conceived...

142
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.329
during big events, right?

143
00:11:17.459 --> 00:11:20.000
- Think of the 2002 World Cup. - My gosh!

144
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.299
Hold on. Are you older than I am?

145
00:11:23.039 --> 00:11:25.640
I read it in a news article.

146
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.209
Gosh, I can't believe it.

147
00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:31.049
- Hold on. - How should we greet her?

148
00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.380
Goodness.

149
00:11:33.449 --> 00:11:35.980
A sudden overnight trip is also...

150
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.819
how I got married.

151
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:42.090
Was there something going on between them?

152
00:11:42.189 --> 00:11:45.090
Who cares when Mother Nature gave them a nudge?

153
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.289
Only idiots would've passed up on that chance.

154
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.059
- Hi, Ha Ri. - Hi.

155
00:11:50.199 --> 00:11:51.600
You seem to be in a good mood.

156
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.470
What? That's ridiculous.

157
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:55.699
But you're glowing today.

158
00:11:55.699 --> 00:11:58.270
Don't be silly. So how's the special feature coming along?

159
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.909
You have no idea how busy I've been.

160
00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.179
Well, I wish you luck.

161
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:03.640
Bye.

162
00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.779
Right? Of course she can't help but smile.

163
00:12:07.779 --> 00:12:09.650
The world must be in different shades of pink to her.

164
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:11.850
How about pink bed sheets as a wedding gift?

165
00:12:11.949 --> 00:12:13.289
Wouldn't money be better?

166
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.459
Have we already sent her down the aisle?

167
00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:18.689
It might be better to throw her a baby shower.

168
00:12:18.689 --> 00:12:20.260
- Gosh! - You're right.

169
00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.260
- What's going on? - Why the sudden mood change?

170
00:12:24.569 --> 00:12:25.630
My gosh.

171
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.039
Did it not happen?

172
00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.549
Is it true that she never had luck with blind dates?

173
00:12:39.549 --> 00:12:40.980
She's only good at fending them off.

174
00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:44.319
No way. I bet she was only swept up in sad thoughts.

175
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.819
She hasn't dated for 10 years,

176
00:12:46.919 --> 00:12:48.590
so she no longer knows how to be in the mood.

177
00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:50.260
It's the same with I Sang.

178
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.789
He only had one long-term girlfriend...

179
00:12:51.789 --> 00:12:53.890
which means he has zero dating experience.

180
00:12:54.059 --> 00:12:55.199
He's a sap in that department.

181
00:12:55.329 --> 00:12:56.829

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.429
What? No.

184
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.039
Stop it.

185
00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:40.770
This is wrong.

186
00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:45.309
Ms. Jang.

187
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:12.909
Unbelievable.

188
00:14:13.939 --> 00:14:15.179
You're even stopping yourself from daydreaming?

189
00:14:18.579 --> 00:14:20.179
Now I'm seeing things.

190
00:14:20.179 --> 00:14:23.579
Exactly. This is what happens when you're sexually frustrated.

191
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.360
I'm only telling you this because it's all in my head.

192
00:14:29.459 --> 00:14:32.329
This is me doing my utmost best to hold back.

193
00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:35.959
Why are you holding back though? I'm 39, not 19.

194
00:14:36.799 --> 00:14:38.169
There's no need to be a gentleman.

195
00:14:38.699 --> 00:14:40.029
We're both adults,

196
00:14:40.029 --> 00:14:41.840
so an R-rated scene won't be a problem.

197
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.510
I'm being this way because of our age.

198
00:14:45.709 --> 00:14:46.939
We should meet someone

199
00:14:46.939 --> 00:14:48.279
we want to spend the rest of our lives with,

200
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.740
not someone we want to enjoy a heated night with.

201
00:14:51.309 --> 00:14:53.679
Can't you see that I've been...

202
00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.179
making room for you in my heart?

203
00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.590
If I finally come around to kiss you,

204
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:01.919
then I'll never let you go.

205
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.329
You're being awfully dramatic for a simple kiss.

206
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.199
By the way, where's your bedroom? What a nice house.

207
00:15:12.199 --> 00:15:13.529
My bedroom?

208
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:15.740
Where are you off to?

209
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.039
- Here? - Ms. Jang?

210
00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:18.840
What a nice house.

211
00:15:19.539 --> 00:15:22.610
Wait. You can't do this to me.

212
00:15:23.209 --> 00:15:24.279
You...

213
00:15:26.909 --> 00:15:28.650
What on earth was that?

214
00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:31.720
Am I really sexually frustrated?

215
00:15:32.919 --> 00:15:33.919
What's wrong with me?

216
00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:40.459
- Hyo Joo. - Yes?

217
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:43.199
Weren't you supposed to take photos of the cooking process?

218
00:15:43.429 --> 00:15:45.970
The instructions seemed easy, so I thought I'd write them down.

219
00:15:46.299 --> 00:15:50.400
Young moms don't know how finely they should chop up the ingredients.

220
00:15:50.669 --> 00:15:52.970
The ingredient's size differs depending on the children's age,

221
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:54.039
so how can we not show pictures?

222
00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:56.809
The dishes are styled beautifully.

223
00:15:57.209 --> 00:15:59.150
Photos of the cooking process will only ruin the aesthetic.

224
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.449
Do you think I'm glaring at you to hear your excuses?

225
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.049
I'll have the photos taken.

226
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:08.260
Make sure you have the Advertising Department...

227
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.260
confirm the expiration date on the toothpaste.

228
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.130
They won't bother if you don't remind them.

229
00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.659
Shouldn't she be grateful by the fact...

230
00:16:17.659 --> 00:16:19.299
that someone as beautiful as me...

231
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.929
- is working here? - What...

232
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.870
Ms. Choi!

233
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.709
Are you off to lunch? I'm just coming back from work outside.

234
00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.510
Is something up?

235
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.179
You seem upset.

236
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.949
Did you get an earful?

237
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:40.520
What on earth are you talking about?

238
00:16:40.789 --> 00:16:41.890
I guess you didn't.

239
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.620
But that's what your expression told me.

240
00:16:45.929 --> 00:16:47.429
Mr. Choi Kang,

241
00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.699
could you please mind your own business?

242
00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:51.199
When one doesn't answer you,

243
00:16:51.199 --> 00:16:53.100
it means that he or she doesn't want to talk.

244
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.970
Sorry about that. I don't take hints well, do I?

245
00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.569
You really don't.

246
00:17:00.569 --> 00:17:02.380
You're awful at taking hints!

247
00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:07.250
Let's just stick to polite greetings, okay?

248
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.579
Sure thing. I will from now on.

249
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:13.890
I'll get going then since I'm only making you uncomfortable.

250
00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:18.789
What an idiot.

251
00:17:25.529 --> 00:17:27.829
Are you kidding me?

252
00:17:28.439 --> 00:17:31.439
Gosh, it hurts.

253
00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:41.009
Let's just stick to polite greetings, okay?

254
00:17:47.519 --> 00:17:48.590
Good luck.

255
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.360
He left without helping?

256
00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:59.999
Get out of there!

257
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:01.900
My gosh.

258
00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:03.999
Unbelievable.

259
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:12.380
As if this would kill my vibe.

260
00:18:13.009 --> 00:18:15.919
Why is it so dark in here?

261
00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:18.050
I mean...

262
00:18:22.189 --> 00:18:24.259
What's going on? Are you sick?

263
00:18:26.189 --> 00:18:28.729
I see her when my eyes are open...

264
00:18:29.729 --> 00:18:31.229
and when they're closed.

265
00:18:32.769 --> 00:18:34.530
This is killing me.

266
00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:38.739
What's wrong? Are you having hallucinations?

267
00:18:38.969 --> 00:18:40.370
What's the problem?

268
00:18:40.769 --> 00:18:41.979
Is it here or here?

269
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.280
I can't tell if it's my mind or heart...

270
00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:49.120
that's hurting.

271
00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.080
All I know is that it hurts.

272
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:55.719
There's a song called "A Disease Called Love".

273
00:18:55.719 --> 00:18:57.290
I especially like Part Two.

274
00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:58.560
Why are you here?

275
00:18:58.659 --> 00:19:00.459
I'm swamped with photoshoots today.

276
00:19:00.459 --> 00:19:02.830
Ms. Jang has an important one which involves...

277
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:04.429
an infertile couple.

278
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:05.669
Could you...

279
00:19:06.999 --> 00:19:08.370
perhaps take the job?

280
00:19:09.439 --> 00:19:12.610
You've got to be kidding me.

281
00:19:13.709 --> 00:19:16.040
Why? In case it'll hurt more?

282
00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:22.419
Hey.

283
00:19:28.489 --> 00:19:29.519
Get dressed.

284
00:19:30.659 --> 00:19:31.689
Come on.

285
00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:35.699
Do this shoot for me.

286
00:19:35.699 --> 00:19:38.269
A picture of the product and one for a review.

287
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:39.969
Why should I?

288
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:41.969
It's an excuse to go to the studio.

289
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.999
Mr. Han is there.

290
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.209
Mr. Nam went to the hospital and is out.

291
00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.380
Stop that.

292
00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.209
Listen. If something happened,

293
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:56.019
you need to go with it and make it something more.

294
00:19:56.249 --> 00:19:58.850
Don't jump to conclusions, and don't give me advice.

295
00:19:59.019 --> 00:20:00.989
Just drink your watermelon juice.

296
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.330
Did you hold hands?

297
00:20:07.959 --> 00:20:09.860
- We did not. - You put the moves on though.

298
00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.259
I did not.

299
00:20:12.269 --> 00:20:13.929
You did send him clear signs, right?

300
00:20:14.499 --> 00:20:16.669
Why are you guys so interested in my love life?

301
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.269
It's fun.

302
00:20:19.269 --> 00:20:22.739
You're bored, right? You don't have enough work, do you?

303
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.080
I'm sorry.

304
00:20:26.249 --> 00:20:28.150
Go. Get to work.

305
00:20:38.659 --> 00:20:39.659
Stop it.

306
00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:44.659
It's a hallucination.

307
00:20:44.929 --> 00:20:46.870
Don't fall apart. No.

308
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:47.900
What are you doing?

309
00:20:55.979 --> 00:20:58.179
Seriously. Again?

310
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.179
Are you back?

311
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.919
Okay. Hi.

312
00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.590
You're copying me now, too?

313
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.499
What?

314
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.669
What?

315
00:21:24.699 --> 00:21:27.509
I actually felt something. Are you a human?

316
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.880
Look. I've been saying hi.

317
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:33.110
Do you feel sick?

318
00:21:36.449 --> 00:21:38.419
Okay. Let's go in.

319
00:21:50.659 --> 00:21:51.669
Snap out of it.

320
00:22:05.709 --> 00:22:09.350
"Signals that are 100 percent effective."

321
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.979
(Rest your head on his shoulder and tilt it 45 degrees)

322
00:22:10.979 --> 00:22:14.050
"Rest your head on his shoulder and tilt it 45 degrees."

323
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.989
"Pucker your lips toward his face."

324
00:22:22.959 --> 00:22:25.030
Mr. Han, can we chat?

325
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.870
Okay.

326
00:22:28.999 --> 00:22:32.040
I'm not sure at which angle we should take this.

327
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:34.939
We should look at it thoroughly.

328
00:22:39.449 --> 00:22:41.080
I think we can just take it.

329
00:22:41.949 --> 00:22:44.019
Right? We can just take it.

330
00:22:50.259 --> 00:22:51.590
I'm sleepy.

331
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.030
You're sleepy?

332
00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:01.199
Yes.

333
00:23:04.769 --> 00:23:07.209
I'll take the pictures. Take a nap.

334
00:23:07.739 --> 00:23:08.780
What?

335
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.120
Where did my camera go? Here it is.

336
00:23:27.659 --> 00:23:29.830
Nice, everyone's gone!

337
00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:32.400
Awesome.

338
00:23:33.229 --> 00:23:35.030
Goodness.

339
00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.610
What's this?

340
00:23:38.769 --> 00:23:40.640
I hope your feet will be comfortable in these.

341
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.409
This is seriously so nasty.

342
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.820
Where did he even find this?

343
00:23:53.719 --> 00:23:55.320
This is Cucci, not Gucci.

344
00:23:57.489 --> 00:23:58.560
Do you not like it?

345
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.469
Can't you tell what my style is?

346
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.769
They had Brada too. I should've gotten those.

347
00:24:12.239 --> 00:24:15.880
You really are amazing, Mr. Choi Kang.

348
00:24:17.179 --> 00:24:18.479
You're too kind.

349
00:24:18.709 --> 00:24:20.650
Wear these for now.

350
00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:23.949
I'll get you Brada and Ballemciaga next time.

351
00:24:23.949 --> 00:24:25.219
It's 2 for 10 dollars.

352
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.890
It's fine. Don't bother.

353
00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.729
I'm happy with these.

354
00:24:35.459 --> 00:24:36.530
Do you mean it?

355
00:24:39.169 --> 00:24:42.070
These are very durable.

356
00:24:42.169 --> 00:24:43.370
Stop talking.

357
00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.479
That looks super fancy.

358
00:24:53.209 --> 00:24:54.550
I make even these look good.

359
00:24:54.749 --> 00:24:58.749
I guess designer goods make the person look classy.

360
00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.719
They look great on you.

361
00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.090
Wear them for a long, long time. I'll go now.

362
00:25:04.419 --> 00:25:05.459
Have a nice day.

363
00:25:06.459 --> 00:25:07.489
A long, long time.

364
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.429
What is he yapping about after buying me knock-offs?

365
00:25:12.169 --> 00:25:15.699
My gosh. How cheap. They're not Gucci, they're Gucheap.

366
00:25:18.939 --> 00:25:21.140
These are so nice.

367
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.409
It's like they were made for me.

368
00:25:27.209 --> 00:25:28.880
Are you doing the shoot?

369
00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:31.080
The schedule was posted. Did you miss it because you were sleeping?

370
00:25:31.479 --> 00:25:32.550
I did not.

371
00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:35.150
This project receives attention nationwide,

372
00:25:35.419 --> 00:25:37.659
so it'll be good for your career as well.

373
00:25:38.759 --> 00:25:41.790
You sound so sweet. Is it because you slept so well?

374
00:25:42.199 --> 00:25:44.560
I did not sleep well.

375
00:25:44.959 --> 00:25:47.900
I worked hard on this series. I wish you'd keep working on it.

376
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:52.340
No.

377
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:55.979
Once his files come out, I hope you stick to this project with Soo Chul.

378
00:25:56.939 --> 00:25:58.009
Okay.

379
00:25:58.239 --> 00:25:59.310
Get in.

380
00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:05.590
Hello.

381
00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:07.850
- Hello. - Hello.

382
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:09.620
How do you feel?

383
00:26:10.419 --> 00:26:12.259
I thought I'd be okay since it's our second,

384
00:26:13.229 --> 00:26:14.530
but I'm twice as nervous.

385
00:26:14.729 --> 00:26:16.159
I can totally understand.

386
00:26:16.929 --> 00:26:18.729
- Come in. - Okay.

387
00:26:18.729 --> 00:26:20.100
Okay.

388
00:26:20.469 --> 00:26:23.499
We'll film the consultation...

389
00:26:23.499 --> 00:26:26.469
as well as the steps afterward.

(Fertility Clinic)

391
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.280
Hello.

392
00:26:37.449 --> 00:26:38.519
Okay.

393
00:26:38.689 --> 00:26:41.959
You've done it before, so you know you need to relax, right?

394
00:26:42.189 --> 00:26:43.219
Yes.

395
00:26:43.659 --> 00:26:45.989
Many people get fertility treatments,

396
00:26:46.259 --> 00:26:48.600
so don't think it's only you.

397
00:26:48.929 --> 00:26:51.429
Think of it as a special way to meet your child.

398
00:26:52.169 --> 00:26:53.169
Okay.

399
00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:54.900
Do you have any questions?

400
00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.499
Are there any medications she should avoid?

401
00:26:58.169 --> 00:26:59.840
Vitamins are fine.

402
00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:03.340
You have to consult me first before taking anything else.

403
00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.640
Are you taking anything now?

404
00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:07.679
I'm only taking lactobacillus at the moment.

405
00:27:08.209 --> 00:27:09.219
That's fine.

406
00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.650
Give her a lot of help.

407
00:27:38.979 --> 00:27:40.050
I will.

408
00:27:40.179 --> 00:27:42.650
Please tell me if there's anything I should do for her.

409
00:27:42.949 --> 00:27:44.080
Just be supportive.

410
00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:54.090
I really hope it works this time.

411
00:27:55.189 --> 00:27:58.459
Must they work so hard and force it?

412
00:28:00.729 --> 00:28:02.469
You have to sacrifice so much...

413
00:28:04.169 --> 00:28:06.310
for a being that doesn't exist.

414
00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:15.620
Look over there.

415
00:28:22.189 --> 00:28:24.620
How could they make a face like that?

416
00:28:27.929 --> 00:28:30.300
When you look at a mom looking at her baby,

417
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.530
isn't it amazing?

418
00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:36.600
Just how must a person love another person...

419
00:28:37.439 --> 00:28:39.110
to make a face like that?

420
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:42.640
How can a person...

421
00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.550
give another person unconditional love...

422
00:28:47.949 --> 00:28:50.650
without wanting anything in return?

423
00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.560
I feel like having someone to love like that in itself...

424
00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:02.699
would set me free from being lonely.

425
00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.800
Is that why women always choose the baby...

426
00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:10.640
if they had to choose...

427
00:29:11.199 --> 00:29:14.640
between the person they love or their baby?

428
00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:21.650
I won't let go...

429
00:29:23.949 --> 00:29:24.979
of the person I love.

430
00:29:26.919 --> 00:29:29.060
I know that having a baby is a miracle.

431
00:29:31.189 --> 00:29:34.429
But I haven't fallen in love for the past 10 years,

432
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:38.100
so love is also a miracle to me.

433
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.439
I brought you some popular baby stuff...

434
00:29:49.439 --> 00:29:51.679
for you and Do Ah.

435
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:55.749
Babies have sensitive skin, so it's important to wash them...

436
00:29:55.749 --> 00:29:57.120
with filtered and clean water.

437
00:29:57.679 --> 00:29:59.290
You're also starting a new life,

438
00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:01.090
so wash yourself properly and become a new person.

439
00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:03.489
Use it well.

440
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:05.989
And you just need to take a photo to prove that you're using it well.

441
00:30:06.229 --> 00:30:09.360
No, I don't feel any sincerity in what you're saying right now.

442
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.769
You'll realize that I'm sincere once you see all the baby stuff...

443
00:30:13.769 --> 00:30:15.469
that I'll be bringing from now on.

444
00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.570
Really? Then let me see that.

445
00:30:35.613 --> 00:30:36.613
What are you doing?

446
00:30:41.824 --> 00:30:44.254
Why aren't you giving it to me? All I did was grab it.

447
00:30:44.254 --> 00:30:45.663
Look how hard you're holding onto it.

448
00:30:45.663 --> 00:30:47.564
Fine. Let's just stay like this all night.

449
00:30:47.564 --> 00:30:48.863
I just changed the showerhead.

450
00:30:50.163 --> 00:30:51.294
And I did it in one go.

451
00:30:52.334 --> 00:30:53.334
I see.

452
00:30:53.804 --> 00:30:56.873
You're turning 40 soon, but you're still so tiny.

453
00:30:56.873 --> 00:30:59.504
I can hug you with just one arm. What's the matter with you?

454
00:30:59.504 --> 00:31:01.403
You should exercise your shoulders and increase your strength.

455
00:31:01.403 --> 00:31:03.544
What do you want? Do you want me to beat you up?

456
00:31:03.774 --> 00:31:05.683
How about I beat you up tonight?

457
00:31:06.014 --> 00:31:07.943
Do Ah, it's time for a bath.

458
00:31:09.984 --> 00:31:10.984
It's warm, isn't it?

459
00:31:13.324 --> 00:31:14.584
My sweetheart.

460
00:31:14.754 --> 00:31:16.754
What are you doing? What's with your face?

461
00:31:17.254 --> 00:31:20.064
I'm trying to look natural as I wash my kid.

462
00:31:20.264 --> 00:31:22.163
Just be yourself. Don't look at the camera.

463
00:31:22.464 --> 00:31:23.534
Do Ah, cover your ears.

464
00:31:25.534 --> 00:31:29.034
I never washed her with her mom, so this is new to me.

465
00:31:30.274 --> 00:31:31.603
I'm just saying.

466
00:31:32.443 --> 00:31:34.343
I was just talking about the situation.

467
00:31:35.004 --> 00:31:37.413
It was just the theme of the shoot.

468
00:31:39.814 --> 00:31:40.843
I'm done taking photos.

469
00:31:44.953 --> 00:31:47.883
I may not be her mom,

470
00:31:48.123 --> 00:31:50.193
but I take care of her like an aunt.

471
00:31:50.294 --> 00:31:52.524
Actually, that's what I am. I'm her aunt.

472
00:31:52.764 --> 00:31:55.363
You're not her aunt. You're just a stranger.

473
00:31:55.593 --> 00:31:57.334
My gosh, don't be so coldhearted.

474
00:31:57.764 --> 00:31:59.433
We're not strangers.

475
00:31:59.433 --> 00:32:00.504
Then what are we?

476
00:32:01.663 --> 00:32:04.633
We're not a family. We're not married.

477
00:32:05.234 --> 00:32:06.873
We're pretty much a family.

478
00:32:06.873 --> 00:32:08.173
Right, Do Ah?

479
00:32:13.814 --> 00:32:16.453
Come here and help me wash her. Hurry up and sit down.

480
00:32:16.784 --> 00:32:18.613

The babysitter called and said she can't make it today,

485
00:32:39.173 --> 00:32:41.343
so I have to stay with my baby today.

486
00:32:42.103 --> 00:32:43.244
Is your baby okay?

487
00:32:43.673 --> 00:32:46.544
She just needs to take a few tests at the hospital.

488
00:32:47.343 --> 00:32:49.214
Tell them that I'll send them the report soon.

489

Okay, sure.

It's okay. I'll hold you.

I'm sorry. Right now, I'm with her sister at the hospital.

528
00:35:59.703 --> 00:36:01.544
I'll prescribe three days' worth of medicine for his cold,

530
00:36:02.844 --> 00:36:05.274
- Okay. - You're all done.

531
00:36:05.913 --> 00:36:08.384
- I'm going to jump on the bed. - Can you check him too?

532

He's also going to catch a cold soon.

533
00:36:10.053 --> 00:36:11.984
He needs to show symptoms.

- Go on. - I want to go!

You cut all ties with us after you got married.

544
00:36:34.904 --> 00:36:37.013
It's not easy to bring my kids to a hospital.

545
00:36:37.243 --> 00:36:39.114
Just do me a favor.

546
00:36:40.214 --> 00:36:43.614
What's your number? Let me introduce you to a psychiatrist.

547
00:36:43.683 --> 00:36:44.783
You're showing severe symptoms.

548
00:36:44.783 --> 00:36:46.084
What's your phone number?

549
00:36:46.223 --> 00:36:49.154
I'll report you for refusing to treat your patient.

550
00:36:50.754 --> 00:36:53.694
(The Shocking Sperm Lady)

551
00:36:53.694 --> 00:36:54.763
What's this?

552
00:36:56.163 --> 00:36:57.163
Isn't this Ha Ri?

553
00:36:57.564 --> 00:36:59.734
What? "Ha Ri"?

554
00:37:01.504 --> 00:37:03.404
(The Shocking Sperm Lady)

555
00:37:05.073 --> 00:37:06.073
This is Ha Ri.

556
00:37:11.913 --> 00:37:13.814
Hello, this is the Editing Department for The Baby.

557
00:37:14.544 --> 00:37:17.314
It's her personal life, so we don't know.

558
00:37:18.214 --> 00:37:20.283
It has nothing to do with our magazine,

559
00:37:20.283 --> 00:37:21.453
so you don't need to worry.

560
00:37:21.654 --> 00:37:25.424
No, I don't know anything about it.

561
00:37:25.654 --> 00:37:27.263
Hello, this is the Editing Department for The Baby.

562
00:37:27.263 --> 00:37:29.794
What? What lady? No, she's not here.

563
00:37:31.334 --> 00:37:34.734
Yes, hello. No, I don't know who told you that.

564
00:37:35.103 --> 00:37:37.203
But it's not true. Don't worry.

565
00:37:37.504 --> 00:37:39.004
Hello, this is the Editing Department for The Baby.

566
00:37:39.004 --> 00:37:40.344
Hello, this is the Editing Department for The Baby.

567
00:37:40.344 --> 00:37:42.714
I'm sorry. I have nothing to tell you. Sorry.

568
00:37:43.614 --> 00:37:45.714
Gosh, I can't believe this!

569
00:37:47.444 --> 00:37:48.884
Hasn't anyone heard from Ha Ri?

570
00:37:51.413 --> 00:37:52.513
Hello, this is the Editing Department for The Baby.

571
00:37:52.513 --> 00:37:53.584
- The receiver cannot be reached... - My goodness.

572
00:37:53.884 --> 00:37:55.484
She won't pick up.

573
00:37:55.484 --> 00:37:57.424
I have to tell her to not answer any phone calls from journalists.

574
00:37:57.424 --> 00:38:00.424
Where in the world is she? People are saying crazy things.

575
00:38:00.893 --> 00:38:02.493
I can't believe her personal information got leaked.

576
00:38:03.163 --> 00:38:04.263
My goodness.

577
00:38:04.893 --> 00:38:06.203
My gosh, I can't believe this.

578
00:38:08.163 --> 00:38:09.234
Hey, where...

579
00:38:27.254 --> 00:38:29.794
Ha Ri, what's going on?

580
00:38:29.953 --> 00:38:33.294
I turned in the posts online as evidence...

581
00:38:33.864 --> 00:38:35.464
and asked for them to be removed.

582
00:38:35.464 --> 00:38:38.433
Good thinking. I contacted some people too...

583
00:38:38.433 --> 00:38:41.404
and asked them to delete your personal information...

584
00:38:41.404 --> 00:38:43.033
and hate comments that were posted online.

585
00:38:47.073 --> 00:38:49.714
But Ha Ri... Ha Ri?

586
00:38:51.643 --> 00:38:52.714
Ha Ri?

587
00:38:53.614 --> 00:38:56.053
Are you all right though? Are you okay?

588
00:38:56.283 --> 00:38:59.323
Sorry about that. What did you say you did?

589
00:39:00.723 --> 00:39:02.283
Don't be intimidated, okay?

590
00:39:02.283 --> 00:39:04.393
I warned those who wrote hate comments.

591
00:39:04.594 --> 00:39:07.964
If they keep this up, I'll cut off their fingers myself.

592
00:39:07.964 --> 00:39:09.433
How dare they speak ill of you.

593
00:39:10.134 --> 00:39:12.834
Don't be like that to strangers.

594
00:39:12.834 --> 00:39:15.103
Ha Ri, don't worry too much.

595
00:39:15.734 --> 00:39:16.734
Right.

596
00:39:17.873 --> 00:39:19.473
Thanks for everything. I'll call you back. Sorry.

597
00:40:30.114 --> 00:40:31.774
- Ms. Jang... - What the...

598
00:40:38.484 --> 00:40:40.524
Mr. Choi Kang? What...

599
00:40:41.353 --> 00:40:43.553
What's going on?

600
00:40:44.393 --> 00:40:47.163
(Noodles)

601
00:40:50.564 --> 00:40:52.033
Everyone was worried...

602
00:40:52.033 --> 00:40:53.904
because they couldn't get in touch with Ms. Jang.

603
00:40:54.134 --> 00:40:56.134
I asked HR for her address...

604
00:40:56.603 --> 00:40:58.734
and was headed there to see her.

605
00:40:59.373 --> 00:41:02.203
I was just walking by. I live around here, you see.

606
00:41:03.243 --> 00:41:05.243
This is your fault for not answering your phone.

607
00:41:06.243 --> 00:41:09.783
It was ringing like crazy, so I needed a break.

608
00:41:11.714 --> 00:41:13.183
Did you file a report with the police?

609
00:41:13.754 --> 00:41:15.254
Yes, but it's not just...

610
00:41:15.254 --> 00:41:16.853
my personal information that's the issue.

611
00:41:17.453 --> 00:41:19.663
They know where I work now too.

612
00:41:20.094 --> 00:41:22.893
Don't read any of the online comments, okay?

613
00:41:23.364 --> 00:41:25.163
I don't why they're saying these awful things.

614
00:41:25.163 --> 00:41:26.533
That's not who you are.

615
00:41:26.904 --> 00:41:29.573
Sperm Lady, also known as, gold-digger, right?

616
00:41:31.334 --> 00:41:33.344
They're also saying things about my name too.

617
00:41:33.544 --> 00:41:36.513
For the first time in my 39 years, I learned that my name...

618
00:41:36.513 --> 00:41:38.314
has sexual innuendo.

619
00:41:38.444 --> 00:41:41.944
Don't read your emails or messages you receive on social media.

620
00:41:42.114 --> 00:41:44.084
Also, take time off work and get some rest.

621
00:41:44.254 --> 00:41:46.283
You should. That sounds like a plan.

622
00:41:46.453 --> 00:41:49.553
It'll blow over when a new scandal breaks out.

623
00:41:50.223 --> 00:41:52.453
People only see what I did wrong.

624
00:41:53.194 --> 00:41:56.594
But all I wanted was to become a mom.

625
00:42:02.533 --> 00:42:03.603
Ms. Jang.

626
00:42:05.674 --> 00:42:07.743
Let me know if you need any help.

627
00:42:08.844 --> 00:42:10.714
- Sure. - What kind of help...

628
00:42:10.844 --> 00:42:13.484
can a colleague give her?

629
00:42:14.384 --> 00:42:15.844
You should let your roommate know.

630
00:42:16.183 --> 00:42:18.553
The roommate should stick to issues around the house...

631
00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:20.353
and leave work-related problems to her colleagues.

632
00:42:20.353 --> 00:42:23.094
That's me then. I'm your colleague, right?

633
00:42:23.094 --> 00:42:26.053
So you're drawing the line...

634
00:42:26.053 --> 00:42:29.564
and saying that you're only colleagues. Right?

635
00:42:29.933 --> 00:42:32.904
Actually, we've always been colleagues.

636
00:42:33.103 --> 00:42:34.933
It seems like you need to clear the air...

637
00:42:35.033 --> 00:42:37.004
in regard to who you are to her as well.

638
00:42:37.073 --> 00:42:40.004
I'm the person who lives with her.

639
00:42:40.004 --> 00:42:43.114
I told you that numerous times, so what else should I say?

640
00:42:43.844 --> 00:42:45.143
- Unbelievable. - Gosh.

641
00:42:52.283 --> 00:42:53.884
It's been a while since we got together so...

642
00:43:01.794 --> 00:43:03.663
- How much is it? - 53 dollars.

643
00:43:03.663 --> 00:43:05.033
No, don't.

644
00:43:05.033 --> 00:43:07.163
- I'll buy. - Save it.

645
00:43:07.163 --> 00:43:08.964
- But I said I'd buy. - It's okay.

646
00:43:08.964 --> 00:43:11.504
- It's all right. - Let us pick up the bill...

647
00:43:11.504 --> 00:43:12.533
and wait for us outside.

648
00:43:13.973 --> 00:43:15.573
- Here. - Here.

649
00:43:22.714 --> 00:43:25.584
I don't know if it's cute or childish.

650
00:43:27.353 --> 00:43:29.123
It's okay. Let me pay for today.

651
00:43:29.123 --> 00:43:30.623
- Let me. - No, let me.

652
00:43:30.623 --> 00:43:32.453
- Take it back. - Here you go.

653
00:43:32.453 --> 00:43:34.623
You're starting to upset me. Let me pay for this.

654
00:43:34.623 --> 00:43:35.893
Why would you though?

655
00:43:35.893 --> 00:43:38.263
Is there a reason why I can't? Here's my card.

656
00:43:38.263 --> 00:43:39.904
I don't let those younger treat me to meals.

657
00:43:40.004 --> 00:43:41.033
What?

658
00:43:41.433 --> 00:43:43.603
I'm probably richer than you are.

659
00:43:45.774 --> 00:43:48.444
Wait. Well,

660
00:43:48.643 --> 00:43:50.413
I didn't want to say this,

661
00:43:50.743 --> 00:43:54.314
but the unit I live in looks over the Han River.

662
00:43:54.314 --> 00:43:55.314
What?

663
00:43:57.783 --> 00:43:59.084
Well, I'm a doctor...

664
00:43:59.413 --> 00:44:02.754
which means I have the potential to end up richer than you.

665
00:44:04.453 --> 00:44:05.924
- Then. - Let me buy instead.

666
00:44:05.924 --> 00:44:07.723
It's only 53 dollars. Here.

667
00:44:08.393 --> 00:44:09.993
You're right, it's her.

668
00:44:09.993 --> 00:44:11.334
See?

669
00:44:13.703 --> 00:44:15.504
- Right? - You're right.

670
00:44:15.504 --> 00:44:17.933
- Then... - Hush!

671
00:44:19.103 --> 00:44:20.103
Sperm Lady!

672
00:44:22.303 --> 00:44:24.473
Don't be like that.

673
00:44:25.373 --> 00:44:27.214
You're the Sperm Lady, right?

674
00:44:27.513 --> 00:44:29.214
Stop it.

675
00:44:29.614 --> 00:44:31.453
What did I tell you?

676
00:44:31.714 --> 00:44:33.623
I told you that it was her.

677
00:44:35.123 --> 00:44:36.393
Gosh.

678
00:44:37.393 --> 00:44:39.694
You're way prettier in person though.

679
00:44:39.993 --> 00:44:41.094
You have the wrong person.

680
00:44:41.424 --> 00:44:42.924
Hold on a second.

681
00:44:43.493 --> 00:44:45.594
You need a guy, right?

682
00:44:48.134 --> 00:44:50.933
Let go of me if you want to go home to your wife in one piece.

683
00:44:52.234 --> 00:44:55.203
Look at her playing hard to get. How adorable!

684
00:44:55.203 --> 00:44:58.913
Just so you know, my sperms conceived triplets.

685
00:44:58.913 --> 00:45:01.484
So put your faith in me...

686
00:45:01.484 --> 00:45:02.614
and join me for a glass of wine.

687
00:45:02.614 --> 00:45:04.254
Get your filthy hands off me!

688
00:45:05.013 --> 00:45:07.654
Harassing someone isn't something to be proud of.

689
00:45:07.783 --> 00:45:10.094
Humiliating a person is an act of violence too.

690
00:45:10.424 --> 00:45:11.553
How dare you.

691
00:45:12.654 --> 00:45:14.323
Who do you think you are?

692
00:45:15.294 --> 00:45:18.234
Why are you making me feel ashamed of my good intentions?

693
00:45:19.904 --> 00:45:21.564
- Why? - Thanks for the meal.

694
00:45:25.674 --> 00:45:26.743
Ha Ri?

695
00:45:28.174 --> 00:45:29.243
I don't need the receipt.

696
00:45:30.114 --> 00:45:31.143
Ha Ri?

697
00:45:32.413 --> 00:45:33.584
What's wrong?

698
00:45:35.214 --> 00:45:36.814
Who do you think you are?

699
00:45:39.754 --> 00:45:40.953
What's the meaning of this?

700
00:45:42.723 --> 00:45:44.424
Who are you people?

701
00:45:45.393 --> 00:45:47.323
Why on earth is she in tears?

702
00:45:47.594 --> 00:45:50.294
Must we even ask? She's in tears for crying out loud.

703
00:45:50.334 --> 00:45:53.163
- What did you do to her? - Look here, guys.

704
00:45:53.334 --> 00:45:56.134
Anyone can tell that I'm the victim here.

705
00:45:56.473 --> 00:45:58.603
She hit me with her purse.

706
00:45:59.533 --> 00:46:02.444
- Let's call the cops. - Yes, let's call the cops.

707
00:46:02.444 --> 00:46:05.743
Call the cops! That crazy cow will be buried deep...

708
00:46:06.044 --> 00:46:08.714
- once I'm through with her. - Hey!

709
00:46:09.754 --> 00:46:12.484
Fine. Call the cops. I'll make sure you're buried too.

710
00:46:13.723 --> 00:46:15.754
- Should we call the cops? - Hold on a second.

711
00:46:16.993 --> 00:46:18.094
What did you call her?

712
00:46:19.053 --> 00:46:20.163
"A crazy cow"?

713
00:46:21.524 --> 00:46:22.564
Say it again.

714
00:46:23.594 --> 00:46:24.663
I dare you to say it again.

715
00:46:31.234 --> 00:46:32.674
Unbelievable!

716
00:46:33.033 --> 00:46:35.073
Guys, just think about this for a second.

717
00:46:35.073 --> 00:46:36.844
We saw her photo online.

718
00:46:36.844 --> 00:46:39.243
It's all over the Internet!

719
00:46:39.243 --> 00:46:41.513
It's just there for everyone to see.

720
00:46:41.513 --> 00:46:43.783
We saw her photo online...

721
00:46:43.783 --> 00:46:46.683
and just acknowledged that we recognized her.

722
00:46:46.683 --> 00:46:48.783
But she got all crazy.

723
00:46:49.223 --> 00:46:51.053
She kicked me...

724
00:46:51.053 --> 00:46:52.823
and hit me with her purse.

725
00:46:52.924 --> 00:46:55.094
That crazy Sperm Lady...

726
00:46:55.094 --> 00:46:56.194
Please don't.

727
00:47:00.404 --> 00:47:01.603
Let's just go.

728
00:47:09.504 --> 00:47:11.473
Mr. Han, don't.

729
00:47:12.114 --> 00:47:13.584
He's not worth it.

730
00:47:31.163 --> 00:47:34.303
Don't be upset over what those mindless jerks said.

731
00:47:35.033 --> 00:47:36.234
You did nothing wrong.

732
00:47:37.573 --> 00:47:38.573
He's right.

733
00:47:38.873 --> 00:47:41.473
You did nothing wrong.

734
00:47:58.853 --> 00:48:01.364
You didn't have to walk me all the way home.

735
00:48:02.364 --> 00:48:05.194
We felt bad, so we wanted to.

736
00:48:05.533 --> 00:48:06.533
That's right.

737
00:48:07.663 --> 00:48:11.634
Besides, I was able to flex my muscles thanks to you.

738
00:48:11.834 --> 00:48:13.743
What a waste.

739
00:48:14.544 --> 00:48:17.344
I wanted to show off my intellect.

740
00:48:17.973 --> 00:48:19.373
I lost my chance.

741
00:48:21.484 --> 00:48:22.513
Ms. Jang.

742
00:48:23.714 --> 00:48:24.783
Look at this.

743
00:48:25.714 --> 00:48:28.353
That guy from earlier. Should we report him?

744
00:48:31.194 --> 00:48:32.194
Show them.

745
00:48:34.123 --> 00:48:35.393
Were you an art major?

746
00:48:35.993 --> 00:48:37.834
- You're good. - You really are.

747
00:48:37.834 --> 00:48:41.564
If you make me laugh like this, I'll shake it off and sleep well.

748
00:48:42.663 --> 00:48:45.174
Thank you. I mean it.

749
00:48:46.774 --> 00:48:47.904
Get home safely.

750
00:48:49.344 --> 00:48:51.473
- Good night. - Thank you both.

751
00:48:51.473 --> 00:48:53.214
- I mean it. - Good night.

752
00:48:56.143 --> 00:48:57.413
- What? - Keep walking.

753
00:48:57.614 --> 00:49:00.223
- Why are you following me? - The front door will wake Do Ah.

754
00:49:00.453 --> 00:49:03.024
- Open it carefully then. - I'll go through your place.

755
00:49:03.154 --> 00:49:04.323
Seriously?

756
00:49:05.953 --> 00:49:06.964
Get out of my way.

757
00:49:11.634 --> 00:49:12.794
They really do live together.

758
00:49:14.163 --> 00:49:15.234
Are they together?

759
00:49:15.334 --> 00:49:17.904
I'm sure they're just friends.

760
00:49:21.603 --> 00:49:24.913
Ms. Jang looked so frail today.

761
00:49:26.143 --> 00:49:28.984
I'll have to protect her more going forward.

762
00:49:33.053 --> 00:49:34.084
Shall we go?

763
00:49:50.674 --> 00:49:51.703
Open up.

764
00:49:53.134 --> 00:49:54.774
It's urgent.

765
00:49:55.643 --> 00:49:57.243
Ha Ri! Hurry!

766
00:50:02.884 --> 00:50:04.013
Ta-da.

767
00:50:08.323 --> 00:50:11.993
When I'm sad, I read comic books.

768
00:50:12.594 --> 00:50:13.823
Yes?

769
00:50:22.033 --> 00:50:24.904
Should I post something saying you're not like that?

770
00:50:25.004 --> 00:50:26.103
It's okay.

771
00:50:27.303 --> 00:50:29.004
That won't make anyone understand me.

772
00:50:33.944 --> 00:50:35.513
I'm financially stable,

773
00:50:36.384 --> 00:50:38.584
and I know I can raise a baby well.

774
00:50:39.154 --> 00:50:42.623
But there's no way to have a baby unless I get married.

775
00:50:43.794 --> 00:50:46.794
But I don't have a man or the confidence...

776
00:50:47.223 --> 00:50:48.524
to get married.

777
00:50:51.464 --> 00:50:53.964
How many people would understand if I say that's why I did it?

778
00:50:54.933 --> 00:50:56.364
It would be hard even 40 years from now.

779
00:51:00.344 --> 00:51:01.873
Don't blame yourself.

780
00:51:02.803 --> 00:51:05.714
Whatever the reason was, no one has the right...

781
00:51:05.714 --> 00:51:07.283
to share your identity or judge you.

782
00:51:08.084 --> 00:51:09.314
No one.

783
00:51:17.024 --> 00:51:20.024
This let me see who's really on my side.

784
00:51:20.763 --> 00:51:21.794
So it's fine.

785
00:51:24.163 --> 00:51:25.263
Me?

786
00:51:27.933 --> 00:51:29.033
That's right.

787
00:51:33.473 --> 00:51:35.344
Oh no.

788
00:51:35.544 --> 00:51:38.373
Oh no. Do Ah.

789
00:51:40.643 --> 00:51:42.743
Were you scared because you were alone?

790
00:51:42.844 --> 00:51:44.913
Is that right, Do Ah?

791
00:51:44.913 --> 00:51:47.223
Don't cry. It's okay.

792
00:51:47.323 --> 00:51:48.783
It's okay.

793
00:51:48.783 --> 00:51:52.553
Goodness. You were scared because you were all alone.

794
00:51:52.553 --> 00:51:55.094
- Goodness. - Ha Ri.

795
00:51:58.294 --> 00:51:59.294
Do you want to marry me?

796
00:52:02.622 --> 00:52:03.722
Ha Ri.

797
00:52:06.392 --> 00:52:07.392
Do you want to marry me?

798
00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:15.900
Listen. If you want a babysitter, pay for one.

799
00:52:16.871 --> 00:52:18.541
It's hard to get sperm.

800
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:22.570
Why don't you just raise Do Ah as your own?

801
00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.010
Don't look at me like that.

802
00:52:26.981 --> 00:52:29.650
There's an easy path before you. Why take a detour?

803
00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:31.180
It's easy for you.

804
00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:32.650
I don't need a man.

805
00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:35.950
Am I a man?

806
00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:44.260
Then what? Are you a woman?

807
00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:47.231
A Miss? Ms. Jae Young?

808
00:52:54.641 --> 00:52:56.981
We'll stop for a picture.

809
00:52:56.981 --> 00:52:59.941
- Okay. - Come quickly.

810
00:52:59.941 --> 00:53:01.650
- Look here. - Come this way.

811
00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:03.150
- Okay. - It's so nice.

812
00:53:03.351 --> 00:53:04.680
This is the spot.

813
00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.421
- It's nice out. - Okay.

814
00:53:06.521 --> 00:53:07.950
- Ready? - Yes!

815
00:53:08.121 --> 00:53:09.621
1, 2, 3.

816
00:53:09.621 --> 00:53:11.820
- Cheese. - One more time.

817
00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:13.220
1, 2, 3.

818
00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:14.630
Cheese!

819
00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:16.461
Okay. Good.

820
00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:17.961
It's so nice out.

821
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:19.731
- Hey. - Yes?

822
00:53:19.731 --> 00:53:22.671
Your daughter's name is Jang Ha Ri, right? And she works for a magazine.

823
00:53:23.331 --> 00:53:24.470
Why do you ask?

824
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:26.601
My daughter tells me...

825
00:53:26.911 --> 00:53:29.070
your daughter is all over the Internet.

826
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:32.941
If you type in her name, her articles will show up.

827
00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.351
That's true for all reporters. She isn't famous.

828
00:53:35.351 --> 00:53:38.450
No. I hear your daughter is famous.

829
00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:39.880
What was it?

830
00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:42.291
"Sperm Lady"?

831
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:45.760
She should find a man, not buy sperm.

832
00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:47.731
Is something wrong with her?

833
00:53:48.791 --> 00:53:50.530
What did I tell you?

834
00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.161
I told you to make her quit when she said...

835
00:53:53.161 --> 00:53:54.570
she was too busy as a journalist to date.

836
00:53:54.871 --> 00:53:57.271
She couldn't get married yet at her age.

837
00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:00.411
She may not have a record, but she's a criminal.

838
00:54:00.671 --> 00:54:02.970
Gosh. That poor thing.

839
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:04.740
She'll never get married.

840
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:07.150
Are you out of your mind? Whom are you calling a criminal?

841
00:54:07.351 --> 00:54:09.481
Who are you to call my daughter a criminal?

842
00:54:09.481 --> 00:54:10.880
What's wrong with you?

843
00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:13.590
- Hey! - Separate them!

844
00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:15.851
- Separate them! Goodness! - What's going on?

845
00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:33.840
I'm losing my mind.

846
00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.351
Hey.

847
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:48.220
What? You can't go in?

848
00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:53.391
Mr. Joo called me in at this hour.

849
00:54:53.831 --> 00:54:56.090
It can't be out of consideration so people don't see me.

850
00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:58.760
It means it's very serious.

851
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:01.200
I'm a bit scared.

852
00:55:04.001 --> 00:55:06.001
I can't go in for you.

853
00:55:06.371 --> 00:55:08.110
But I'll show you this.

854
00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:13.110
Want to see? Ta-da.

855
00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:17.550
How's that for the main photo?

856
00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:21.251
You're so dependable.

857
00:55:23.021 --> 00:55:25.921
I may be scolded today, but I'll be praised later on.

858
00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:29.590
I wanted to develop the photos with you.

859
00:55:31.601 --> 00:55:32.700
Next time.

860
00:55:36.941 --> 00:55:39.470
Next time, let's go together for sure.

861
00:55:40.141 --> 00:55:41.171
Okay.

862
00:55:44.541 --> 00:55:45.610
Next time.

863
00:56:03.961 --> 00:56:05.001
Sperm Lady.

864
00:56:06.101 --> 00:56:08.130
The chairman wants an apology.

865
00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:13.641
The chairman is very concerned because of the complaints...

866
00:56:13.641 --> 00:56:14.740
from readers.

867
00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:17.041
Publish an apology...

868
00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:19.380
in lieu of the editor's column.

869
00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:20.811
What...

870
00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:24.421
She's the victim. Why should she apologize?

871
00:56:24.751 --> 00:56:26.481
This got out of hand.

872
00:56:27.021 --> 00:56:29.691
She should explain and apologize...

873
00:56:29.691 --> 00:56:31.461
to the readers.

874
00:56:31.461 --> 00:56:33.421
This is her personal matter.

875
00:56:33.731 --> 00:56:36.331
I'm against it becoming public as a magazine matter.

876
00:56:36.331 --> 00:56:39.630
I won't waste a precious page for a flimsy apology.

877
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:41.371
It's not a flimsy apology!

878
00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:45.171
She should apologize sincerely and calm the readers down.

879
00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:47.371
Why are you so dense?

880
00:56:49.711 --> 00:56:53.780
So... I... I know...

881
00:56:54.351 --> 00:56:55.481
I was wrong.

882
00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:01.621
I know I disappointed the readers.

883
00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:05.720
I'm very sorry for hurting the magazine's credibility...

884
00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.061
and hurting the company.

885
00:57:08.530 --> 00:57:09.731
However,

886
00:57:09.731 --> 00:57:13.101
do you really think my apology will make the readers...

887
00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:15.300
read our magazine again?

888
00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:18.771
I'll take responsibility for what happened.

889
00:57:24.311 --> 00:57:25.380
How?

890
00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:30.421
First of all, I'll ask our readers to understand my situation.

891
00:57:30.650 --> 00:57:31.921
"Understand"?

892
00:57:34.490 --> 00:57:35.621
Ms. Jang.

893
00:57:36.291 --> 00:57:39.521
This isn't a piece of advice. It's an order.

894
00:57:39.791 --> 00:57:42.490
I want you to stop our readers from complaining so much!

895
00:57:42.691 --> 00:57:44.731
We're not getting any advertisements because of you.

896
00:57:48.101 --> 00:57:49.601
If there's a decrease in sales,

897
00:57:50.601 --> 00:57:52.101
will I get suspended again?

898
00:57:52.271 --> 00:57:53.271
No.

899
00:57:55.671 --> 00:57:57.211
This time, you'll get fired.

900
00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.751
What should I do?

901
00:58:06.121 --> 00:58:07.791
Why are you asking me? It's not my responsibility.

902
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:12.590
Hurry up and decide. Are you going to write a column or not?

903
00:58:13.791 --> 00:58:17.501
I could get fired. Give me some time to think.

904
00:58:19.601 --> 00:58:21.771
I need to help my husband take care of the children. Go home.

905
00:58:21.771 --> 00:58:22.800
Okay.

906
00:58:26.271 --> 00:58:28.141
Don't trust Mr. Joo.

907
00:58:29.371 --> 00:58:30.680
He's a jerk, too.

908
00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:35.581
Hey, honey.

909
00:58:36.411 --> 00:58:38.550
Did her fever go down, honey?

910
00:58:41.851 --> 00:58:43.121
I know, honey.

911
00:58:44.461 --> 00:58:45.561
I love you, honey.

912
00:58:50.291 --> 00:58:53.030
Hello? We don't know the details.

913
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:54.570
Okay, bye. Sorry.

914
00:59:00.171 --> 00:59:02.240
Just block them from leaving comments on our website.

915
00:59:02.271 --> 00:59:03.671
That's impossible.

916
00:59:03.671 --> 00:59:06.311
Most people are just calling to curse at us.

917
00:59:06.311 --> 00:59:09.010
Gosh, why do I need to hear them curse at me?

918
00:59:09.411 --> 00:59:11.320
We should sue them for slander.

919
00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:13.180
Let's start by suing them for obstruction of business.

920
00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:14.751
I can't do any work because of them.

921
00:59:15.450 --> 00:59:17.391
That's a great excuse to quit.

922
00:59:20.691 --> 00:59:23.191
Not enough to actually make me quit.

923
00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:25.930
That's a pity.

924
00:59:28.371 --> 00:59:31.200
I'm going to go home now. Don't overwork yourselves already.

925
00:59:33.441 --> 00:59:34.441
And...

926
00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:37.380
I'm sorry.

927
00:59:42.251 --> 00:59:44.351
I'm sorry for making you take care of my mess.

928
00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:47.291
I told you that I'm your future, but I take it back.

929
00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:51.061
I don't want any of you to go through this.

930
00:59:52.921 --> 00:59:55.760
Forget it. Just buy us some food before you go.

931
00:59:58.501 --> 00:59:59.630
I'll buy you something nice.

932
01:00:10.271 --> 01:00:12.510
(Letter of Apology)

933
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:22.291
Hey, Mom.

934
01:00:24.561 --> 01:00:27.191
Mom, what happened to your hair? You said you'll be back tomorrow.

935
01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.860
You brat!

936
01:00:33.061 --> 01:00:36.171
Why did you ask me to buy you squid? You're only going to drink more!

937
01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:40.811
Do you know how hard it was to...

938
01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.240
I fell while trying to buy that.

939
01:00:47.751 --> 01:00:48.811
Sorry.

940
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:59.860
Don't let yourself feel small just because I'm angry at you.

941
01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:05.200
And don't blame yourself or feel like you made a mistake...

942
01:01:06.161 --> 01:01:07.331
just because people badmouth you.

943
01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:12.840
I know very well that you did nothing wrong.

944
01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.891
(Dachae Media)

945
01:01:34.561 --> 01:01:35.630
Ms. Jang.

946
01:01:35.891 --> 01:01:39.501
Did you write an apology? Today's the due date.

947
01:01:41.871 --> 01:01:45.340
Ms. Jang, just write an apology.

948
01:01:45.871 --> 01:01:48.311
Our clients are really angry.

949
01:01:48.711 --> 01:01:51.581
They might withdraw their ads starting from next month.

950
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:55.911
If I publish an apology, will they change their minds?

951
01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.320
It's important to take action.

952
01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.251
We need to show them that we're sorry and that we'll do well...

953
01:02:02.621 --> 01:02:03.720
and that they can trust us.

954
01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:06.090
That's the only way I'll be able to convince them.

955
01:02:06.961 --> 01:02:08.891
Just do what's best for everyone.

956
01:02:09.791 --> 01:02:13.661
Mr. Kim, I don't think my apology will solve everything.

957
01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:17.300
If I admit that I made a mistake, they'll use that to withdraw the ad.

958
01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:20.101
I'm not doing this to save my pride.

959
01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:26.010
Do you at least have a solution to this?

960
01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.450
Yes.

961
01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:49.800
I have endometriosis.

962
01:02:50.570 --> 01:02:52.041
My ovaries are 40 years old.

963
01:02:55.041 --> 01:02:56.441
And the possibility for me to get naturally pregnant...

964
01:02:56.441 --> 01:02:57.541
is less than seven percent.

965
01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:03.450
I'm subfertile.

966
01:03:16.331 --> 01:03:18.300
That's ours, right? Let me take that.

967
01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:20.501
Thank you.

968
01:03:28.771 --> 01:03:33.081
(Am I not allowed to have a baby without getting married?)

969
01:03:56.001 --> 01:03:59.200
I'm subfertile.

970
01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:03.141
I'm 39 years old.

971
01:04:04.481 --> 01:04:05.981
And I'm single.

972
01:04:08.751 --> 01:04:10.110
My love for babies...

973
01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.820
prevents me from quitting my job at a baby magazine company.

974
01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:15.050
That's the kind of person I am.

975
01:04:16.351 --> 01:04:17.891
As I'm about to turn 40,

976
01:04:19.391 --> 01:04:21.530
I found myself at a crossroad where I might have to give up...

977
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:22.760
on getting married and pregnant.

978
01:04:23.691 --> 01:04:25.430
And that really made me want to have a baby.

979
01:04:26.961 --> 01:04:30.271
My doctor told me that I should get pregnant within six months.

980
01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:33.941
And it felt like that was how much time I had left to live.

981
01:04:35.211 --> 01:04:37.311
Growing up, I was always an obedient student.

982
01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:42.050
So I chose to listen to my doctor.

983
01:04:44.351 --> 01:04:47.720
If you ask me why I'm taking things this far to have a baby,

984
01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:53.161
I honestly don't know what to say.

985
01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:57.291
I just like babies,

986
01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:00.400
and I want to become a mom.

987
01:05:01.930 --> 01:05:03.430
How else can I explain that?

988
01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:07.200
I don't know...

989
01:05:08.311 --> 01:05:09.811
what's right and wrong.

990
01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:16.050
I just think my efforts...

991
01:05:16.811 --> 01:05:19.720
will become a process to find the right answer.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.691

(I'd like to share my story with you every month...)

996
01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:30.490
and find the answer to this together.

What brings you here, Mr. Han?

1003

Well...

1004
01:06:49.911 --> 01:06:51.440
Is there a way for me...

while factoring in our friendship of 39 years.

1013
01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:42.091
There's no reason for me to deny your last wish.

1014
01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:43.560
I'll marry you.

1015
01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.761
Of course not.

1016
01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.360
I had no idea my heart would ache this much for you.

1017

Ms. Jang, consider this...

1018
01:07:51.001 --> 01:07:52.070
as a stamp.

1019
01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:54.240
Good job.
