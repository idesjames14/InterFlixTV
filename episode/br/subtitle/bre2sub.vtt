00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.010
(Ji Chang-wook)

2
00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.210
(Kim You-jung)

3
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.090
(Backstreet Rookie)

4
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.490
Yeon-joo, I have to get going.

5
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.230
What? Where?

6
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.800
-To the convenience store.
-Why?

7
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.700
I have to check on something. It's urgent.

8
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.730
-What is it?
-The part-timer girl.

9
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.770
I thought we were going to work out
the whole night.

10
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.440
I think I've sweated enough.

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.340
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

12
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.610
I didn't know the part-timer was a girl.

13
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.260
Drink up.

14
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.160
If you mix alcohol, it's bad for you.

15
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.600
Are they serious right now? My gosh, okay.

16
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.670
Is she trying to suck me dry?
She's unbelievable.

17
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.070
I'll put an end to you girls today.

18
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.240
You darn parasites.

19
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.610
Let me get you guys some more beer.

20
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.110
Will that be enough?

21
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.250
You should drink some hard liquor
since it's going to be your last supper.

22
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.789
Mr. Choi?

23
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.370
Why are you here so early?

24
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.970
My shift isn't over yet.

25
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.940
You're off for good.

26
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.340
You came here to see me
because you missed me?

27
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.509
I'm here to fire you.

28
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.850
-Girls, say hi to my boss.
-What do you think you're doing?

29
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.790
-Say hi.
-Don't say hi.

30
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.720
-Hello.
-Hello.

31
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.830
Why is she asleep all of a sudden?

32
00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:07.660
Hey, wake up!

33
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.430
You must've overworked her.

34
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.400
I can't believe that she fell asleep
while drinking.

35
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.770
Nonsense. She didn't overwork herself,

36
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.570
she overdrank herself! You brats.

37
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.180
It has been three years, right?

38
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.920
He has such a great memory!

39
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.750
Of course, it's hard to forget someone
as beautiful as I am.

40
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.390
I get that a lot. You may sit.

41
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.730
(These brats,)

42
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.960
(-they never listen to other people.)
-Sit down!

43
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.130
-Come on.
-No!

44
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.600
Fine. I'm seated.

45
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.340
I hear that you suspected
Saet-byul of stealing.

46
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.340
My, my! How could you be so awful?

47
00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.880
What an awful boss you are.

48
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.850
Thank you, girls.

49
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.690
No, that was all a misunderstanding.

50
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.150
-Misunderstanding?
-Misunderstanding?

51
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.990
There was nobody else but her to question.

52
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.260
That's why I made up for that
by cleaning the whole store.

53
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.570
Why are you trying to change the topic?

54
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.700
What do you think you're doing
at my store?

55
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.270
You're too loud.

56
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.570
No, I'm not!

57
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.910
Fine, we'll tell you if you're so curious.

58
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.050
Hold on. I think this is
the perfect timing for more beer.

59
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.760
No!

60
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.030
This is beautiful. Look at this.

61
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.730
What do you want me to do with this?

62
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.140
You're no use for anything
except for being eye candy.

63
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.840
What? What are you talking about?

64
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.940
You have the alcohol tolerance
of a teenager.

65
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.450
-Yes, of a teenage boy.
-That's why you can't drink.

66
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.620
What are you talking about?
I can drink this.

67
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.920
-You want me to drink this?
-Yes.

68
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.149
-I'm drinking it.
-Okay.

69
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.350
I'm really going to drink it.

70
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.330
-Drink it up, chug it down
-Drink it up, chug it down

71
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.630
-Chug it down like a man
-Chug it down like a man

72
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.740
-One more glass since you're done!
-One more glass!

73
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.840
There you go.

74
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.470
Seriously?

75
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.940
He left me all alone

76
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.880
to hang out with little girls?

77
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.480
How ridiculous.

78
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.950
-Drink it up, chug it down
-Drink it up, chug it down

79
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.390
-Chug it down like a man
-Chug it down like a man

80
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.290
Really?

81
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.830
-Really. You can bet your life on it.
-It's true.

82
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.200
Why are you betting my life on this?

83
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.800
What I mean is that I'm that sure.

84
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.170
Really? Are you sure?

85
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.840
That was three years ago. She...

86
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.110
Really? I don't believe this.

87
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.780
This can't be.

88
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.620
Poor girl.

89
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.620
Whatever. Let's just...

90
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.190
-Let's just drink some more.
-All right.

91
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.330
-Sure.
-You have to chug this down at once.

92
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.860
-Chug it!
-Chug it!

93
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.080
Look.

94
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.880
These two look like they're meant-to-be.

95
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:49.450
Meant to be an annoying couple.

96
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.820
Hey! Saet-byul!

97
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.720
Wake up, Saet-byul!

98
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.400
-What?
-She's up.

99
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.960
-You saw that, right?
-What happened?

100
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.200
Mr. Choi! What are you doing here?

101
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.700
Did you sleep well, Saet-byul?

102
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.040
We told him everything,
so you sort it out with him, okay?

103
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.080
What did you tell him?

104
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.280
We told him everything
about why you're working here

105
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:22.350
and all of your plans.

106
00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.480
You're welcome.

107
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.659
How could you tell him everything?

108
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:31.990
-Look at that.
-Look at that.

109
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.800
You should thank us
for being your wing-women.

110
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.030
So what did he say?

111
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.570
He said

112
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.700
-nothing. He fell asleep.
-Just like that.

113
00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.409
He's a no from me. He's old and weak.

114
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.940
I think he stinks too.

115
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.150
Hey! What do you mean he stinks?

116
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.950
Let's go now. Want to take that cab?

117
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.090
-Where? Sure.
-Is someone in there?

118
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.350
Sir, please get going!

119
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.320
(Deluxe Taxi)

120
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.970
Choi Dae-hyun, that man.

121
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.680
My goodness. Here.

122
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.780
How am I going to face him tomorrow?

123
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.290
That's right.

124
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.030
I applied to work here
so that I can see your face every day.

125
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.200
I'm going to work hard and become
a real employee,

126
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:47.400
so you just watch.

127
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.909
You won't regret hiring me.

128
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:55.780
Good night. I'll come back
to wake you up later.

129
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.790
Don't leave.

130
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.090
Don't leave.

131
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.630
Please don't leave.

132
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:32.380
What's this?
You were pretending to be asleep?

133
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.820
I guess

134
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.820
I could stay for a little longer.

135
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.500
Here.

136
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.930
Thank you.

137
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.730
Of course you are.

138
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.300
Sales have spiked since I started working.

139
00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.140
Thank you,

140
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.010
Yeon-joo.

141
00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.420
"Yeon-joo"?

142
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.450
Yeon-joo.

143
00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:12.790
Did you just say Yeon-joo?

144
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.720
Yeon-joo...

145
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:16.720
Seriously?

146
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.860
What, Yeon-joo?

147
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.830
I can't deal with this.

148
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.320
-Drink it up, chug it down
-Drink it up, chug it down

149
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.690
(-Drink it up like a real man
-Drink it up like a real man)

150
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.290
How did it go?

151
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.290
No.

152
00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.330
Give me a call when you see this.

153
00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.870
Not this either.

154
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:06.170
Dae-hyun,

155
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.280
you looked like you had a blast.

156
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:12.910
Did I really send that?

157
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.580
I'm crazy!

158
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:18.150
Wait. Delete. Delete!

159
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.860
(Dae-hyun,
you looked like you were having a blast.)

160
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.030
(The message has been deleted.)

161
00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.900
Three, two, one!

162
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.400
-Close!
-Wait!

163
00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.510
-You kids!
-Please let us in.

164
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:39.470
-Just this once.
-Where do you think you're going?

165
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.410
You can't go in.

166
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:42.610
Did you ever see me letting anyone
off the hook?

167
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.680
Please!

168
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:46.150
This school is all about rules.

169
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.220
Go and stand over there.

170
00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.650
And also,

171
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.550
how can you be late

172
00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:56.160
-every single day?
-Sorry.

173
00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.730
Why are you always late?

174
00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.930
-Good morning.
-Hello.

175
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.600
Hwang Geum-bi!

176
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.570
Yes, sir.

177
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.370
You reek of alcohol.

178
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.150
Do you think it's appropriate for you
to come to school

179
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.950
drunk like this
when there are other students?

180
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.650
Hold your hands out.

181
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:27.050
-Hold your hands out! Close your eyes.
-Oh, gosh.

182
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.060
How dare you?

183
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.490
You deserve this.

184
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.830
Drink this in three portions.

185
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.630
It'll make you choke if you drink it all
at once.

186
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.970
-Really?
-Yes.

187
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.600
Thank you.

188
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.240
I'll tell my dad
how nice you've been to me.

189
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:48.910
No, I'm not doing this to kiss up
to Chairman.

190
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.810
I'm an educator,

191
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.610
and this is just an innocent educator
taking care of his pupil.

192
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.050
Of course, I understand.
I can go now, right?

193
00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.690
Yes. Dan-bi!

194
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.690
It's Hwang Geum-bi.

195
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.460
Sorry, did I say Dan-bi?

196
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.990
Today's lunch is

197
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:09.400
bean sprout hangover soup.

198
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:11.800
This is what I come to school for.

199
00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.270
The food here is great!

200
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:21.980
That rude brat.

201
00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.510
Mr. Choi Dae-hyun, you're under arrest

202
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.850
from buying cigarettes
for underage minors three years ago.

203
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.750
What are you talking about?

204
00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.820
What's happening? Hold on.

205
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.360
Make sure he gets sentenced
to the longest time possible in jail.

206
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.960
Yeon-joo, why are you doing this to me?

207
00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.860
I wanted a rough man, not a bad one.

208
00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.030
How am I bad?

209
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:42.600
Ma'am,

210
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:45.800
I'm quite the rough man myself.

211
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:47.440
Yeon-joo, look here.

212
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.100
-I'm as rough as I can be.
-Look.

213
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.470
Great. I love men in uniform.

214
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.340
I'm wearing a uniform. Look.
I'm wearing the convenience store vest.

215
00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.680
You're my type.

216
00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:00.610
-How dare you touch her?
-Shall we go out together, then?

217
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.720
Don't go.

218
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.850
Don't go! Come here, you.

219
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.960
(Police)

220
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.830
Yeon-joo, don't leave. He's a weird man!

221
00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.460
You're even weirder, you criminal.

222
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.870
Sir.

223
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.570
I'm not weird. Don't leave!

224
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.110
I'm bleeding.

225
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.380
(Hey! Yeon-joo!)

226
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:35.820
What's this?

227
00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:39.390
Why am I bleeding?

228
00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:41.820
My goodness.

229
00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.720
Why is my nose bleeding?

230
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:49.530
What happened to me?

231
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.900
Did I get beaten up?

232
00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:03.110
Saet-byul?

233
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:06.210
What are you doing here?
What time is it right now?

234
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:08.720
You worked two hours overtime.

235
00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.050
How can I leave when you're not awake?

236
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.160
I'm so sorry. I'll pay overtime.

237
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.390
Go home.

238
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:21.000
I really don't feel well.
Even my nose is bleeding.

239
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.330
-You're not going to say that to me?
-Say what?

240
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:26.570
Don't leave.

241
00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.670
Don't leave, please.

242
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.270
-Go.
-What?

243
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:36.480
Go. Why would I tell you to not go?

244
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.180
Go home. Bye.

245
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.790
Go home already.

246
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:46.890
Go. Hurry.

247
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.260
(Taesung University)

248
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:53.290
Hello!

249
00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:55.460
Hey! What would you like?

250
00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.530
-I'll take two packs of Soboro Red.
-Two Soboro Red.

251
00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:00.700
Why are you buying two packs?

252
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.370
-That'll be nine dollars.
-Okay.

253
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.740
Try to quit.

254
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.910
-Quit, okay?
-I'll try. Bye!

255
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.350
Goodness.

256
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:16.080
Maybe I drank too much.

257
00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:23.860
(-Drink it up, chug it down
-Drink it up, chug it down)

258
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:27.190
-Drink it up like a real man
-Drink it up like a real man

259
00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.530
Wait.

260
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:32.800
I remember.

261
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:38.370
Why haven't these been paid for?

262
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.410
What? All of them?

263
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:44.810
They just took whatever
and are making me pay?

264
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:46.810
My goodness.

265
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.420
These darn parasites!

266
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.290
Saet-byul, you're dead.

267
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:58.730
What's this?
Why did she delete her message?

268
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.060
Wait, 2 a.m.?

269
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.330
What was I doing at 2 a.m.?

270
00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.870
-Drink it up, chug it down
-Drink it up, chug it down

271
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:11.240
(-Drink it up like a real man
-Drink it up like a real man)

272
00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.370
Oh, my.

273
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.040
This can't be. She couldn't have seen me.

274
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.850
But why did she delete the message?

275
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.650
This is bad.

276
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:21.080
I can't even ask her.

277
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.680
What's wrong with asking her?

278
00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.180
Why did she delete her message?

279
00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.250
Come on, wake up.

280
00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.930
(Who are you texting?)

281
00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.230
(The part-timer.)

282
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.540
(I'm sorry for not calling you
last night.)

283
00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.180
(What was the message that you sent
and deleted?)

284
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.880
(Are you busy?)

285
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.180
(Please give me a call when you see this.)

286
00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:08.099
(I'm off early today.
Would you like to have dinner with me?)

287
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.530
(I'd love to!)

288
00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:26.950
(Thank you.)

289
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.420
"Thank you."

290
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.150
(Don't leave.)

291
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.550
(Thank you.)

292
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.760
-"Thank you, Yeon-joo"?
(-Thank you, Yeon-joo.)

293
00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:44.730
Why are you thanking her?

294
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:48.470
Why are you thanking her?
And what did you say to me?

295
00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.370
"Go"? "Go home already"?

296
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.610
You should go home, you jerk!

297
00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.080
My ears are itchy.
Is someone badmouthing me?

298
00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.790
Here's carbonara pasta, cream risotto,

299
00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:08.560
and Gorgonzola pizza.

300
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.360
-Why aren't you eating?
-I was just about to eat.

301
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.670
I was going to eat
when you told me to eat.

302
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.700
Yeon-joo, the thing is...

303
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:27.210
Actually, I was craving
something spicy today.

304
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:29.440
Why is that? To cure your hangover?

305
00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.150
No. Who said I drank?

306
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.280
I crave spicy food twice a week.

307
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.980
You should have told me sooner.

308
00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.290
Right. I should have told you.
But I wasn't sure if I should or not.

309
00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:42.990
But it's better not to bring it up
if you can't fix it. Right?

310
00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.090
What can we do now?
You don't want to eat this,

311
00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.730
but we can't go to another restaurant.

312
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:50.700
Right. It looks like
I made a mistake again.

313
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.400
"Again"? It sounds like
you made another mistake.

314
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.600
What did you do?
Did you make a mistake last night?

315
00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:01.410
No. No, I didn't. I didn't do anything.

316
00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:03.410
You just said

317
00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.950
that you made a mistake "again".

318
00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.950
I just deduced that you made
another mistake based on what you said,

319
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.880
logically-speaking.

320
00:19:11.050 --> 00:19:13.250
I see. "Logically-speaking".

321
00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.060
It's... Oh, right.
I saw on my phone that you texted me

322
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.890
last night.

323
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:20.460
You saw it?

324
00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.300
Of course, I did. How could I miss it?
It said so on my phone.

325
00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.170
"The message has been deleted".

326
00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.110
By the way, what was that about?

327
00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.940
Why did you text me
that late and delete it?

328
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:37.680
What? It's nothing. It was a mistake.

329
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.750
I see. A mistake.

330
00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.920
I didn't know you also made mistakes.
I mean you're only human too.

331
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.820
Why did you ask me that now
instead of asking me last night?

332
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:48.920
I guess you were very busy last night.

333
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:52.030
(-Drink it up, chug it down)
-Yes.

334
00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.130
When you texted me, there were
so many customers all of a sudden.

335
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:57.000
And the trucks were coming.

336
00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.400
I was sweating,
and there was so much to do.

337
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.840
-I see. You were busy.
-Yes.

338
00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:14.750
Gosh, this is especially tasty today.
The noodles are great.

339
00:20:15.650 --> 00:20:18.120
The chef is feeling good today. Nice.

340
00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:22.060
(So you won't tell me the truth?)

341
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.200
(-I can feel her intense gaze at my head.)
-This is good.

342
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.230
-Is that so?
(-She doesn't know anything, right?)

343
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.840
Gorgonzola pizza.

344
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:39.870
Honey.

345
00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.410
Gosh, it hits the spot.

346
00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:49.020
-What?
-What?

347
00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.330
-Bye.
-Okay.

348
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:05.870
Well, you were going to meet my parents.

349
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:06.930
Yes.

350
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.570
I've given that some thought.

351
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.110
I think it's polite
that I meet your parents first.

352
00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:13.540
My parents said the same thing.

353
00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:15.040
But why all of a sudden?

354
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:17.180
"All of a sudden"?

355
00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.880
We decided to meet each other's
parents last year. Did you forget?

356
00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:24.020
Well, I remember that.
But you and I are both crazy busy.

357
00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.150
Right. We're always busy.

358
00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.720
But we should still do things properly.

359
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.560
Okay. Let's think about it.

360
00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.290
Okay. That sounds great.

361
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.930
You're heading back to the store, right?

362
00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.430
Yes. I have to fire the part-timer.

363
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:41.230
Why all of a sudden? Did something happen?

364
00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:46.270
I left right away after getting a call
from Dal-sik when we were working out.

365
00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:47.240
Right.

366
00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.940
She called her friends

367
00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.610
and had a party in front of the store.
I couldn't believe my eyes.

368
00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:55.050
My goodness. So what did you do?

369
00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.850
I mean, if she called her friends,
her friends must have been young girls.

370
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.220
You should have drunk with them.

371
00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.060
(-Drink it up)
(-Drink it up)

372
00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.960
(-Chug it down)
-What are you talking about?

373
00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:09.030
Why would I drink with those young girls?

374
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.970
I acted very much like an adult.
I taught them a lesson.

375
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:14.970
I kicked all of them out.

376
00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:16.300
I see.

377
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.210
You acted like an adult
and kicked them out.

378
00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:22.940
Yes, I did. They were crying
and making a huge scene.

379
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:25.580
(-Chug it down)
-They said I was scary

380
00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.980
(-Chug it down like a man
-Chug it down like a man)

381
00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.590
That should never happen again.

382
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.020
Right. Of course.

383
00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.960
I should get going.
I should go and fire her.

384
00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.200
Bye, Yeon-joo.

385
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.230
-Sweet dreams. Bye.
-Okay.

386
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.300
-Bye.
-Bye.

387
00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.070
I should go and fire her.

388
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:57.240
Hi.

389
00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:00.910
-Mom.
-Hey, you're home.

390
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.880
Look at this.

391
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:06.850
Oh, this must be the artwork you bought
at the Sotheby's auction in Hong Kong.

392
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.520
It arrived today.

393
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:09.790
Congratulations.

394
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.830
Shouldn't I congratulate you?

395
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.230
Ms. Yoo, I prepared the tub for your bath.

396
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.630
-I'll go wash up.
-Okay.

397
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.870
I'm home.

398
00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.240
You're back.

399
00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.180
Why did you drink?
You don't usually drink.

400
00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.850
I had a drink with beef.

401
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:37.080
Beef? I guess you must've had a good day.

402
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:40.590
Hye-su bought us a meal
because she had the highest sales.

403
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.930
-Did you buy a massage chair?
-Yes.

404
00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.790
-How long is the installment?
-24 months.

405
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.860
Which card did you use?

406
00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:52.500
I saw a red credit card
on the dressing table.

407
00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.330
-There's always a card.
-Right.

408
00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.800
Hey, I want some beef too.

409
00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:00.510
Right. I'm so envious of you.

410
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:06.850
I'm working so much to the point
where my feet are swollen

411
00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:11.250
to pay off your credit card debt!

412
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:14.350
I'm walking around on these puffy feet!

413
00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:18.260
But you're lounging at home
while doing a cucumber facial massage

414
00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:21.760
on the massage chair you bought
with a 24-month installment.

415
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.600
I'm so jealous of you, cucumber!

416
00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.330
I'm about to die!

417
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.700
I'm about to die.

418
00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.840
But there are eggs, right?

419
00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:35.310
Do we have eggs at home or not?

420
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.940
Answer me. Answer my question.

421
00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.410
Shouldn't you need eggs
to soothe your bruised eyes?

422
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.780
Get up!

423
00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:44.850
Get a refund.

424
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:46.290
I took off the plastic wrap.

425
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:48.660
Don't talk back. Get a refund.

426
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.260
My gosh, how did I end up
with such an awful husband?

427
00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.160
What's the point of living like this?

428
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.760
You're so loud!

429
00:24:56.830 --> 00:25:00.570
Do it quietly, so I don't hear anything.

430
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.010
Oh, merciful Buddha.

431
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.710
(After she started working here,
we're definitely getting)

432
00:25:12.410 --> 00:25:14.110
(more customers.)

433
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.220
(-The sales went up too.)
-Please come again.

434
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.150
-Okay.
-See you tomorrow.

435
00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:19.920
-Bye.
-We'll come back tomorrow.

436
00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:22.920
It's worth making the trip
all the way here.

437
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.930
Of course, don't you know who I am?

438
00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:28.960
Thanks for bringing me here.
You definitely deserve to be the captain.

439
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.970
It's 1 dollar and 50 cents.

440
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:35.100
My gosh, look how she treats the customer.

441
00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.800
-She threw that to the customer.
-Up top!

442
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.470
-My gosh, she's driving me crazy.
-Come again! See you tomorrow.

443
00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.580
Hey, didn't I tell you she's gorgeous?

444
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.880
Hey, she's so pretty.

445
00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:58.660
It was because
that was Saet-byul's first kiss.

446
00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.230
That kiss?

447
00:26:01.290 --> 00:26:03.800
She just put her lips on mine.
That was her first kiss?

448
00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.870
My gosh. Hey, I don't believe you.

449
00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.770
Why did she kiss me?

450
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:14.010
Does she even like me?

451
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:15.110
-Yes.
-Yes.

452
00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.880
That's not true, right?

453
00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:23.820
We were shocked to see
that she kissed you.

454
00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.290
Since we're sharing secrets,
should I let you in on one more secret?

455
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.560
-Tell him.
-That first kiss

456
00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.830
was her last kiss!

457
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.560
Then...

458
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:40.130
Hold on. After that day,
she has never kissed anyone.

459
00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:42.670
There might be cobwebs in her mouth.

460
00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:46.810
My gosh.

461
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.580
I am...

462
00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:51.480
Water...

463
00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.020
Wait.

464
00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:00.290
Mr. Choi!

465
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.890
No. This isn't it. Get a grip.
Choi Dae-hyun.

466
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.030
You came here today to fire her.

467
00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.100
There were a lot of customers.

468
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:13.970
And the sales went up.

469
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:17.300
It was so hard to work by herself
that she almost died.

470
00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:18.810
This means to die?

471
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:23.510
My gosh, this is such a weird gesture.
Why do I keep doing this?

472
00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.840
So this means she almost died?

473
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:27.010
Come inside!

474
00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.890
Hello. Should I ring it up?

475
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.420
-Yes. This, please.
-Sure.

476
00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:35.860
-Hold on, my baby.
-It's two dollars.

477
00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.560
-Do you need a bag?
-No, I don't.

478
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:41.360
By the way, this convenience store
is really good.

479
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.330
-Is it your first time here?
-Yes, I just moved here yesterday.

480
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.770
Really? Come often.

481
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:48.840
I will. I have a big family.

482
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.340
Really?

483
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:52.810
What's your name? You're so adorable!

484
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:55.080
-It's Frank.
-I see. Prank.

485
00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:57.980
-Frank.
-Prankie.

486
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:59.880
Prankie.

487
00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:02.450
Bring your mom, dad, grandpa, grandma,

488
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.880
and all of your siblings, okay?

489
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:11.160
Wait.

490
00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:15.030
My gosh, so her last kiss wasn't me.

491
00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.930
-Bye.
-Bye.

492
00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.330
Mr. Choi.

493
00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.130
What's wrong?

494
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.900
I can see a sense of betrayal
in your eyes.

495
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.610
No. No, that's not true.
What's wrong with my eyes?

496
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:28.340
Are you the manager here?

497
00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.110
Yes. I'm the manager here. Hello.

498
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.750
You're very young and handsome.

499
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.790
Thank you. You have a beautiful dog.

500
00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.490
-Hi.
-Do you want to hug him?

501
00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.690
Wait. This is... Darn dog.

502
00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:48.500
-Darn...
-"Darn dog"?

503
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.760
No.

504
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:54.070
-That's not what I meant.
-I'm sorry.

505
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:57.040
-My Frank made a huge mistake.
-Frank...

506
00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.270
I was going to come here a lot
since I moved here.

507
00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.940
Seeing how you hate my dog,

508
00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:03.510
-No. I love...
-I can't ever come back.

509
00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.210
No, you can totally come back.

510
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.080
-Bye. I'm leaving.
-Wait. Hold on.

511
00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:08.920
-Ma'am. Frank.
-Gosh.

512
00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.680
-You're not a darn dog, my baby.
-I love dogs. I love puppies.

513
00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:14.290
Wait, ma'am. Frank.

514
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:15.420
Come on.

515
00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.990
Mr. Choi! Come back here!

516
00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:22.030
What do you think you're doing?

517
00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.500
She said she had a big family.
I wanted her to use this store.

518
00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.070
So I even kissed the dog.
What are you doing?

519
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:30.640
What's the value
and standard of your kiss?

520
00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:31.700
No.

521
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:33.940
No.

522
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.940
Ms. Jung Saet-byul.

523
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:39.950
Come here.

524
00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.520
Come this way.

525
00:29:46.150 --> 00:29:48.090
-What is it?
-Ms. Jung Saet-byul.

526
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.160
Explain to me about last night, please.

527
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.330
"Please"?

528
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:54.660
Why are you being so formal?

529
00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:56.960
Stop it. Do you think this is a joke?

530
00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:58.630
Please explain.

531
00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:02.870
You're asking me if you made mistakes
because you blacked out, right?

532
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.600
You made a lot of mistakes.

533
00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:07.170
You were awful.
I should buy a new set of eyes.

534
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.680
-They didn't see--
-Hey.

535
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.310
Hey, that's not what I meant.

536
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.780
You brought your friends here last night
and drank.

537
00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:16.650
-Didn't I do a good job?
-What do you mean?

538
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:19.090
You drank with your friends
during your working hours.

539
00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.420
I came here to fire you. Did you get that?

540
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.890
What? Listen. I helped you increase sales.
Do I deserve to be fired?

541
00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.390
What sales?

542
00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.800
My friends bought a lot from the store.

543
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.670
They didn't buy from here. They just ate
whatever they wanted from the store.

544
00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:33.870
They paid you.

545
00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:35.400
They didn't pay me. What money?

546
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:36.840
-In your back pocket.
-What's there?

547
00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.940
-The other pocket.
-What? What is it?

548
00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:41.170
Hey, what is this? Is this 200 dollars?

549
00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.480
Don't you remember?

550
00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.350
You even did the hula dance
for my friends.

551
00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.250
And they gave you the change for your tip.

552
00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.020
Don't you know the hula dance?

553
00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.620
The hula dance. You did it,
so you must know what it is.

554
00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:55.560
-Hula dance.
-You mean,

555
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:58.390
I did the hula dance?

556
00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:01.260
-Hey.
-Thank you. Come again.

557
00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:03.100
-Hula, hula.
-My gosh.

558
00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.930
-Hey, stop it.
-Hula.

559
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.570
I should pay you in cash.

560
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:08.700
-Be nice to Saet-byul.
-Be nice to me.

561
00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:11.500
I don't need a receipt,
discounts, or points.

562
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.880
Hey, call your friend, so I can--

563
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:20.050
So you can give it back?

564
00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.380
Can you ask her
if she needs a cash receipt?

565
00:31:22.450 --> 00:31:23.780
She doesn't need receipts.

566
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:26.050
Well, then.

567
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:27.690
Anyway, Saet-byul,

568
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.090
increasing sales is important,

569
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:32.630
but you shouldn't be drinking
when you should be working.

570
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:35.190
This is your first warning.

571
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.000
Hey.

572
00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.970
Money isn't everything. Okay?

573
00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.430
Okay.

574
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:45.310
What's his deal? Seriously.

575
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.010
How could he shake his bottom for them?

576
00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.280
My gosh, you're so stupid.

577
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.780
Why did you take the money
and do the hula dance?

578
00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.320
Forget about firing her.
She has one up on me.

579
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.720
Seriously. She's driving me crazy.

580
00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.160
Gosh, I must've gone mad.

581
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:08.700
-Mr. Choi, please come out here.
-What?

582
00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:12.100
Hey, you. What?

583
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:14.370
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

584
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:16.040
You sold cigarettes to him today, right?

585
00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.440
Yes, earlier.

586
00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.940
How can you sell cigarettes to minors?

587
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.570
You always have problems.

588
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.550
No way. He's a college student.

589
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:30.480
College...

590
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.290
(Backstreet Rookie)

591
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:43.900
Hey.

592
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:46.470
-No!
-You little jerk. Come here.

593
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.540
I should have known.
You always bought two packs.

594
00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.740
I'm sorry.

595
00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:56.940
You told me that you're majoring
in mechanical engineering.

596
00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.480
(He's a high school kid.)

597
00:33:01.850 --> 00:33:03.750
(He stole
the college student's jacket at a bar.)

598
00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.280
We'll take an administrative measure

599
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:06.890
for selling cigarettes to a minor.

600
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:08.490
Wait. No. It's...

601
00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.900
(If you sell cigarettes to minors,
your store is suspended for two months.)

602
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.900
(Did we know they were minors?)

603
00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.930
(If you sell cigarettes to minors,)

604
00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.270
(your store will be suspended
for two months.)

605
00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:20.800
(Besides, look at the kids these days.)

606
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.570
(Some kids look
as old as 40-something years old.)

607
00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:26.170
(Let's get to the point.
What's today's theme?)

608
00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:28.810
(Today's topic:
Good Self-Employed Protection Law)

609
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.810
(If you sell cigarettes to minors
because you fell)

610
00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.650
(for the fake IDs,
presented by the minors,)

611
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:35.920
(the law can lift the suspension
of the business. That's it.)

612
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.380
(What's the key point here?)

613
00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.920
(We must provide the footage
in which we checked their IDs.)

614
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:43.490
(You must have the footage of checking
the minor's ID as evidence.)

615
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:48.530
(You'll be on vacation for two months
against your will. Got that?)

616
00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.760
(March)

617
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.470
Mr. Choi.

618
00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.500
Are you sure you checked his ID?

619
00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:56.570
Yes.

620
00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.610
-When?
-When that jerk first came.

621
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:02.880
-When was that?
-So that was...

622
00:34:03.679 --> 00:34:04.710
Gosh.

623
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:08.280
Gosh, I don't know.
It's so hard to remember.

624
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.219
I don't think it's been
more than six months,

625
00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.820
so I'm going to take a look.

626
00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:17.060
It's going to take 300 hours
to download everything.

627
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.730
How are you going to check?

628
00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.300
Saet-byul, you should get back to work.

629
00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:27.270
The customers will leave
if you're not there.

630
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:28.969
-Just get back to work.
-Let me help.

631
00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.340
No, I'll figure out a way.

632
00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.489
(Play 4 times faster)

633
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:52.590
(Play 4 times faster)

634
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:57.200
(Play 4 times faster)

635
00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.930
Gosh, I remember that day.

636
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.700
(Play 4 times faster)

637
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.910
(Play 4 times faster)

638
00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:37.040
(Part-timer Wanted)

639
00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:39.140
What are you doing outside?

640
00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:42.040
Hey, Mr. Choi. Did you find the footage?

641
00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.510
No, not yet.

642
00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:53.990
Saet-byul,
don't tell my family about this.

643
00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:55.920
Why not?

644
00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:58.790
Just don't.

645
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.790
I'll try to handle it on my own.

646
00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:10.070
I don't want to worry my parents.

647
00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:18.780
(Dae-hyun didn't come home yesterday.)

648
00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:20.210
He was at the convenience store.

649
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:24.750
Why? He hired a part-timer.
Why did he spend the night there?

650
00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.960
Do you think that punk likes Saet-byul?

651
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.990
What kind of nonsense is that?
Will you stop being so absurd?

652
00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.990
How is this absurd?

653
00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:36.730
Why do you always have a problem
with everything I say? You little...

654
00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.900
Have you gone nuts?
Do you want to start the day with a fight?

655
00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:44.800
How about some coffee?

656
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:47.570
Should I add a lot of sugar?

657
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.910
I've been drinking black coffee
my entire life. Why would I want sugar?

658
00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.190
Mr. Choi, I can't let you do this.

659
00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:07.630
What are you still doing here?
You should go home.

660
00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:09.730
How can I go home?

661
00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:13.830
Thanks for everything. I'll make sure
to pay you for the extra hours.

662
00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:16.300
Let's worry about that later
and find the footage first.

663
00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:17.500
Did you find anything?

664
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:27.280
Mr. Choi, this... I mean, he's here again.

665
00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:28.850
Are you sure he's your friend?

666
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.350
Yes.
And for your information, he's Korean.

667
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:35.690
I'm an original Korean.

668
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:38.490
I know I look very young for my age,

669
00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:41.430
but I was born five months after Dae-hyun.

670
00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.730
I think you meant "old", not "young".

671
00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.800
Dae-hyun.

672
00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.340
You should get some rest.
I'll take a look at it instead.

673
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.270
No, it's okay. Just upload your webtoon.

674
00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:55.270
I stayed up all night and finished it.
You should go wash at a sauna.

675
00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.210
-He's right, Mr. Choi.
-What?

676
00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.480
Go to a sauna.

677
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:02.350
Okay, you're right. Thank you so much.

678
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.520
Dal-sik, thank you. Eat this.

679
00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.190
You should get back to work.

680
00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:09.320
-Do me a favor.
-Sure.

681
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:13.060
Dae-hyun, just trust me.

682
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:16.200
We met in middle school
and spent half of our lives together.

683
00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.330
I'll show you the true meaning
of a loyal friend.

684
00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.150
-Doesn't it feel like we're at a museum?
-Yes.

685
00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:37.520
Right? What was the name
of the first human species again?

686
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.290
-It started with an "A".
-Oh, I know. Australopithecus.

687
00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:43.320
Yes, that's the one.
I guess they're not extinct yet.

688
00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:48.760
-My gosh.
-Oh, my goodness!

689
00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:49.830
Darn it!

690
00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.830
-Who are you, old lady?
-"Old lady"?

691
00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.230
Gosh, this caveman knows
how to make me angry. Who are you?

692
00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.440
I'm the manager's friend.

693
00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:57.700
-"Friend"?
-"Friend"?

694
00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:00.370
Listen. We'll take over.
You should just leave.

695
00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.580
Take over what? I was already doing it!

696
00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.240
You don't look very trustworthy.

697
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:07.450
What are you looking at, old lady?
I've been doing a good job.

698
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:11.250
Call me "old lady" one more time.
I'm 22 years old.

699
00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.390
You look like you're in your 40s.
How did you age like that?

700
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:17.720
No wonder they say looks matter.
Watch what you say, you caveman.

701
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:18.790
Oh, gosh.

702
00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.590
-Is that a school uniform?
-Does this look like a military uniform?

703
00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.800
I guess you're on your way
to a Helloween party today.

704
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.770
Yes, that's right.
Why don't you join the party?

705
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:28.030
-Let me go!
-Get over here!

706
00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.100
-Let go of me!
-Stay still!

707
00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:39.750
-Hey! Stop!
-Why are you guys fighting?

708
00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.150
-No, stop! Dal-sik!
-Come on out!

709
00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:44.280
Dal-sik, are you okay?

710
00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:47.020
-Why would you fight?
-We didn't fight!

711
00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:48.390
We just had a conversation.

712
00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:49.760
That old lady is crazy.

713
00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.030
Mr. Choi, your friend's face got crushed.
You guys crushed his face!

714
00:39:53.090 --> 00:39:54.960
No, don't worry. This is how he looks.

715
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.300
-I'm bleeding.
-Dal-sik, calm down.

716
00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.430
-Hey.
-Stop it.

717
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.470
-You darn little brats.
-Let's get out of here.

718
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:04.800
Gosh, please don't fight.
What's wrong with you guys?

719
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:06.670
That little jerk.

720
00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:09.580
Hey!

721
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:12.750
-My gosh, my hair!
-Stop it!

722
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.010
Let go! Let her go!

723
00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.520
-Gosh, stop... Ouch!
-Get off me!

724
00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:21.020
Hey! My gosh! Hey, stop!

725
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:23.990
He pulled my hair out!
I can't believe this!

726
00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.560
What's wrong with you guys?
Why would you fight with him?

727
00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:32.770
I want you to stay up all night
and take turns checking the footage, okay?

728
00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:35.270
-I'll kill you if you miss anything.
-You're so mean.

729
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:38.670
-They're unbelievable.
-Hey!

730
00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.070
Why dd you get into a fight?

731
00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:43.580
I asked you to watch the CCTV footage,
but you got into a fight?

732
00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.440
I'm only holding it in because of you.

733
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:47.210
I got beaten up by a couple of girls.

734
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.180
Your nose is bleeding! Wipe the blood.

735
00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:50.620
Those darn brats.

736
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.850
Gosh, you embarrass me so much.

737
00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.360
Hey, Yeon-joo.

738
00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.160
Right now?

739
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:04.730
Yeon-joo, I don't think
this is a good time.

740
00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.030
(Dae-hyun, I'm in a real hurry.)

741
00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.870
Okay, I'll be right there.
Yes, of course I should go.

742
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.600
I won't take long. Wait right there.

743
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.310
Are you going somewhere?

744
00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:16.440
Something... Something urgent came up.

745
00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:17.510
What is it?

746
00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.410
You don't need to worry about it.

747
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.810
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

748
00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.650
Is it more urgent than this?

749
00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.720
Yes, I'll be right back.
It won't take long.

750
00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.720
Wait for me.
Tell your friends to be careful.

751
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.330
My gosh.

752
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:40.530
I want to kill that jerk.

753
00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.940
Hey, you guys can go home.
This is just a waste of time.

754
00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:51.580
Gosh, go home already!

755
00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:00.020
Why is she so fickle?

756
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:02.490
I bet it all comes from love.

757
00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.260
-Let's go.
-Okay.

758
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:07.530
Gosh, what do I do?

759
00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:11.130
-Yeon-joo!
-Dae-hyun! Hurry!

760
00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:15.130
-Are you okay? What--
-Thank you. I'm glad you're here.

761
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.700
-Are you okay? The car--
-I always think of you when I need help.

762
00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:19.970
Gosh, it's natural for you
to ask me for help.

763
00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.140
What can you ever do without me?

764
00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:24.810
Stop talking in that tone.
The insurance company will be here soon.

765
00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.880
-Oh, okay. I'll use this chance to check--
-Yes, yes.

766
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:28.050
I'm late. I need to go now.

767
00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:29.380
Right. You're late. Go on.

768
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:31.080
I know you can't be late.

769
00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:33.350
-See you later.
-Okay, bye.

770
00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.350
-Yeon-joo, good luck.
-I'll call you later.

771
00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:43.330
My gosh, come on.
I don't have time for this right now.

772
00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:47.470
Lady, you look so pretty

773
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.740
You're so pretty
that you make me go dizzy

774
00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:55.370
Ms. Gong.

775
00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.680
I'm going home now.

776
00:42:57.740 --> 00:42:59.480
Okay, I'm sure you had a long day.

777
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.310
By the way, Ms. Gong, do you smoke?

778
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:05.150
No, I hate the smell of cigarettes.

779
00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.150
Then why did you kiss the cigarette pack?

780
00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:11.490
Because this helps us make money.

781
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:15.560
Lots of customers come to buy cigarettes
and end up buying tons of other stuff.

782
00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:19.060
The guy who just left spent 48 dollars
when he actually came here for cigarettes.

783
00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:21.500
I know it's best to tell them to quit.

784
00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:23.540
But it's hard to do that
when I think of the sales.

785
00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.170
Making a living is very hard.

786
00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:27.770
I guess cigarettes are really important.

787
00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:30.880
Yes, they take up half the sales
of all convenience stores.

788
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:35.710
Anyway, where in the world is Dae-hyun?

789
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:38.150
Why is the manager gone for so long?

790
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:56.300
Sir, stop! Stop! Wait!

791
00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:58.770
You can go ahead without me.
I'll call you.

792
00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.350
Hey, don't sell cigarettes to this guy.

793
00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:10.980
You came here to buy cigarettes
even after what you did to me?

794
00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:12.790
Gosh, you startled me.

795
00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.850
I guess you don't care
because you don't get punished.

796
00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.790
What do you want me to do? That's the law.

797
00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:22.260
Hey, listen. When was the first day
you came to our convenience store?

798
00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:23.400
Why?

799
00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:26.230
So you can prove that you asked for my ID?

800
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.770
Gosh, I don't think I remember.

801
00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:29.840
I bet you do.

802
00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:32.540
You came from the precinct and hospital.
You were wearing a bandage.

803
00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.140
Unbelievable. If you know so well,
why are you asking me?

804
00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:38.480
Just tell me the exact date
of when you first came.

805
00:44:38.540 --> 00:44:39.810
That's all I need to know.

806
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:41.580
Why would I do that? Why?

807
00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:43.150
"Why"? "Why"?

808
00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.380
Hey, you jerk!

809
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:48.190
You might think our store is a place
where you buy cigarettes.

810
00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:51.120
But to our family, it's our lifeline.

811
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:53.460
We bet everything on that store.

812
00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:55.330
My mom's money, my dad's health,

813
00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:58.400
and my entire future.
It holds the future of our entire family!

814
00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:01.500
I won't let a guy like you
have an effect on our sales.

815
00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:03.400
The only thing you can't sell
are cigarettes.

816
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.570
Why are you making it sound like
it's such a big deal?

817
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:09.010
It's not like your store is shutting down.
You're allowed to sell everything else.

818
00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:13.080
You're a real piece of trash.
My gosh, you little...

819
00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:14.810
Are you going to hit me? Go ahead.

820
00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.280
Do you think I won't be able to hit you?

821
00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:19.820
-The CCTV is right there.
-The CCTV...

822
00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:23.820
My gosh, you were saved by the phone call.
You scumbag.

823
00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:25.460
Consider yourself lucky.

824
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.590
-Hello?
(-Mr. Choi, we're in trouble!)

825
00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:32.200
What is it? What happened this time?

826
00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.370
(The convenience store...)

827
00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:38.040
Saet-byul! Wait! I'll be right...

828
00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:40.570
Hey, you... You little...

829
00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.210
If it weren't for the phone call,
I would've... My gosh.

830
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:46.280
-Sir, please scold him.
-Oh, okay.

831
00:45:47.810 --> 00:45:48.880
Darn it.

832
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:51.680
That was so lame.

833
00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:54.020
I can't believe he followed me here.

834
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.660
Can I have a Soboro Red?

835
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:59.660
This doesn't look like you.

836
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:01.690
It's me. I was born in 1991,
the year of the sheep.

837
00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.500
Judging by your conversation,
it seemed like--

838
00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.360
Well, you got it wrong! This is me!

839
00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.430
It's him.

840
00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:12.300
Nice.

841
00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.380
Look at him.

842
00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.010
Do we really have to do this?

843
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:24.350
(Hey, go after him. Don't lose him, okay?
I'll be right there.)

844
00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:25.720
Hey!

845
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:27.750
She always hangs up
once she's done talking.

846
00:46:28.090 --> 00:46:30.090
Do we even need to stalk that guy?

847
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.990
It's our fault for having a friend
who's madly in love.

848
00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.000
Darn it.

849
00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:46.970
I see you bought a cigarette.

850
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:57.480
The manager is so petty.
I can't believe he sent you.

851
00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.990
-Do you know me?
-Of course.

852
00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:03.220
I purposely avoided your working hours
to buy cigarettes there.

853
00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:07.760
Then you must know
that I'm nothing like the manager.

854
00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:10.560
The store is his family's
source of income,

855
00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:12.160
and his life depends on it.

856
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:14.370
But I don't have a family,
and I got expelled.

857
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:15.970
So I have nothing to lose or fear.

858
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:21.410
But do you know why I'm doing this?

859
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:24.940
How do you think I'd feel
if I don't get paid

860
00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:27.980
because the convenience store
doesn't make enough money

861
00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:30.120
due to a jerk like you?

862
00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:36.890
Actually, you know what?
You can pay me instead.

863
00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:39.160
Are you filthy rich? Are you?

864
00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.130
Are you rich or not?

865
00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:43.360
If you hit me, I'll call the cops.

866
00:47:45.200 --> 00:47:46.530
I'll call them for you

867
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:48.530
to tell them you're dead.

868
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.710
That lollipop is really
getting on my nerves.

869
00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:04.080
Do you know what ivy symbolizes?

870
00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.750
-What?
-Repeat after me.

871
00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:07.520
Cigarettes...

872
00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:10.990
Hurry up and repeat after me!
Cigarettes...

873
00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:12.960
"Cigarettes"

874
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:15.490
-...take up half the sales
-"take up half the sales"

875
00:48:15.930 --> 00:48:17.830
-of convenience stores.
-"of convenience stores."

876
00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:22.030
(Ivy symbolizes symbiosis.)

877
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:25.540
Let me ask you one last time.
Tell me the date.

878
00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:29.740
The eighth of January!

879
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:33.280
The eighth of January!
The eighth of January!

880
00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.510
The 8th of January at 6:00 p.m.!

881
00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.350
6:00 p.m.!

882
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:41.350
6:00 p.m.!

883
00:48:42.090 --> 00:48:44.590
Saet-byul! Hey, Saet-byul.

884
00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.660
What happened? Are you okay?

885
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:49.230
-I figured it out.
-Figured what out?

886
00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.530
-Let's go inside.
-What is it?

887
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:53.430
The eighth of January.

888
00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.870
6:00 p.m.

889
00:48:57.840 --> 00:48:59.070
Here it is.

890
00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:00.670
(Taesung University)

891
00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.740
Wait. Let me download this.

892
00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:06.180
-There. We did it.
-Thank goodness.

893
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:07.580
We're all done.

894
00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.050
Here. I'm sure this can save you
from the administrative measure.

895
00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.750
Thank you.
We'll be able to get an extenuation.

896
00:49:16.920 --> 00:49:18.020
I'm relieved.

897
00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:21.530
Saet-byul, wait.

898
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:24.430
What... What happened?

899
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:27.730
I must've bumped into something
while I ran over here.

900
00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.200
My goodness. Wait here.

901
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:35.970
You should've been more careful.

902
00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:42.610
Does it hurt?

903
00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:02.800
Are you okay?

904
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:05.540
Yes.

905
00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:12.610
Why did you do this for me?

906
00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:16.380
If my store gets suspended,
we won't get a lot of cigarette customers,

907
00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:19.250
and you'll have less work to do.
It's not like you'll get paid any less.

908
00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:22.990
Yes, I know.
Obviously, the convenience store

909
00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:27.160
isn't as important to you
as your girlfriend.

910
00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:30.600
So it must be weird to see
a part-timer care so much.

911
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:34.170
Hey, about what happened earlier...
I had to go...

912
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:36.670
It's okay. I don't care about that.

913
00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:40.440
I only took care of this issue
for one reason.

914
00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.380
That's because you promised to hire me

915
00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:48.450
as an official part-timer
if I helped you take care of this issue!

916
00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.820
And I did, so I'm an official part-timer.
Take this off now.

917
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.490
It's official now.

918
00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.520
-Says who?
-What?

919
00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:01.790
What are you talking about?
You said it yourself.

920
00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:04.530
I asked you about it last night,

921
00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.670
and you gave a nod like this.

922
00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:09.070
When did I do that? Where? How? Why?

923
00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:10.340
I don't remember.

924
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.800
My gosh, you were sitting here like this.

925
00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:16.110
-"Okay, sure."
-What? Unbelievable.

926
00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:19.140
When did I ever say that to you?

927
00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:22.350
Are you just making things up
because I was sleeping?

928
00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:23.680
I don't remember saying that.

929
00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.450
My gosh, are you serious?

930
00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.660
Okay, fine. I guess I have no choice.

931
00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.560
I'll just give up on being an official...

932
00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.860
You must think I'm really slow.

933
00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:10.700
Saet-byul,
there's something I want to check.

934
00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:12.460
What's that?

935
00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:15.600
Saet-byul, by any chance...

936
00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.100
Three...

937
00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:21.240
("Three"? Three years ago?)

938
00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:23.440
(When we first met?)

939
00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:26.850
-"Three"?
-Were you...

940
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:29.710
No, I mean...

941
00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.680
Your...

942
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:37.590
-Your first...
(-First what? First kiss?)

943
00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.760
(Is he finally going to ask me?)

944
00:52:39.830 --> 00:52:41.630
"First"? First what?

945
00:52:41.690 --> 00:52:44.660
Well... The first...

946
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:51.870
The first column.

947
00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.870
The first column
of the third display stand is empty.

948
00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:59.180
I kept telling you that it's empty.
Why haven't you filled it up already?

949
00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.250
When will you officially get hired
by slacking off like that?

950
00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:04.350
You have a long way to go.

951
00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:06.920
Do I need to explain
every little detail to you?

952
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:08.750
Will you please work harder?

953
00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:09.820
What...

954
00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:14.290
What? I don't...

955
00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:32.010
I feel like he wanted to talk to me
about what happened three years ago.

956
00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:35.250
Maybe I should've asked him
more questions.

957
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.050
He wants me to look away?

958
00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:42.490
(Part-timer Wanted)

959
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:50.630
My gosh. You should be thanking me.

960
00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.530
-Excuse me.
-Hello. Welcome.

961
00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:01.570
(I'm worried I might've treated her)

962
00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:04.510
(exactly like how I was treated
in the past.)

963
00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.780
(-Dae-hyun!)
-Yes, sir?

964
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:13.350
Did you write this?

965
00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:18.560
Is this the best you can do? Is it because
you went to a community college?

966
00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:22.330
This is why I can't ignore
people's educational backgrounds.

967
00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:25.060
Sir, I wrote that.

968
00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:26.670
It was you?

969
00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:34.910
(-I was too biased to see her)
-Here you go.

970
00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:37.580
(-for whom she really is.)
-Thank you. Bye.

971
00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:46.480
(Hey, Dae-hyun.)

972
00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:49.250
Yeon-joo, you weren't late
to your meeting, were you?

973
00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:53.090
No, but I would've been late
if it weren't for you.

974
00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:57.000
What a relief. I'll drive your car
back to your office tomorrow.

975
00:54:57.330 --> 00:54:58.430
(Thank you.)

976
00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:02.370
There's no need to thank me for this.
By the way, Yeon-joo,

977
00:55:02.770 --> 00:55:04.940
I have something to tell you.

978
00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.440
What is it?

979
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:11.710
I'm not going to fire the part-timer.

980
00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:14.350
What?

981
00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:18.480
Why not? You seemed so eager to fire her.

982
00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:21.520
-I had a misunderstanding.
-What misunderstanding?

983
00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:23.660
I thought she was reckless,
but I was wrong.

984
00:55:23.720 --> 00:55:26.460
And I can really use her help
at the convenience store.

985
00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:28.160
You're being too hasty.

986
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:30.330
You promised to think about it
and discuss it with me--

987
00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.400
(Yeon-joo.)

988
00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:35.400
I know you were my boss
when I used to work in the PR team.

989
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:38.400
But this is
regarding my convenience store.

990
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:42.070
And I've made up my mind as the manager.

991
00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:44.640
So I'd like you to respect my decision.

992
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:45.740
I see.

993
00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:49.350
Okay then. Do whatever you want.

994
00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:55.390
I think she's angry.

995
00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:00.590
Ms. Yoo Yeon-joo.

996
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:02.430
Hello, sir.

997
00:56:02.490 --> 00:56:04.700
Why haven't you gone home yet?

998
00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:07.470
I'm getting ready
for the presentation tomorrow.

999
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.740
You haven't had dinner yet, have you?
I haven't eaten either.

1000
00:56:16.610 --> 00:56:17.610
Yeon-joo.

1001
00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:21.950
We're at work, sir.
Please call me Ms. Yoo.

1002
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:24.920
Okay, Ms. Yoo. I apologize.

1003
00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.450
Is your boyfriend's convenience store
doing well?

1004
00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:32.320
It's our franchise,
so I'm sure you know his sales.

1005
00:56:32.790 --> 00:56:34.690
So can I ask you why you're asking?

1006
00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.390
I'm asking how satisfied he is.

1007
00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:39.430
Our franchises need to be happy
in order for the company to grow.

1008
00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.600
Let's not talk about someone
who isn't here right now.

1009
00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:44.040
Then should we talk about us?

1010
00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.770
Yes, let's do that. Let's talk about work.

1011
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.170
Did you prepare everything
for tomorrow's presentation, sir?

1012
00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:59.920
(I found this among the CCTV footages.)

1013
00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:01.690
(I bet both Eun-jo's and my life)

1014
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:04.020
(that you'll change your mind
once you see this footage.)

1015
00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:06.560
What is she saying? What is this?

1016
00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:31.720
My gosh, really? Not only is he handsome,
but he even knows how to dance.

1017
00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:37.190
I can't believe this.
Dae-hyun, what can't you do?

1018
00:58:28.310 --> 00:58:29.610
My gosh.

1019
00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:36.380
I can't seem to trust her.

1020
00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:40.150
What if she's holding a party
with her friends because I'm not there?

1021
00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:41.550
My gosh.

1022
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.960
Let's see.

1023
00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:47.390
Let's see what she's up to.

1024
00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:52.930
My gosh, look at her.

1025
00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.070
Look at what she's doing
when she should be working right now.

1026
00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.040
What? She knows how to dance.

1027
00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:02.240
Wait a minute.

1028
00:59:02.940 --> 00:59:04.140
That's my dance.

1029
00:59:37.128 --> 00:59:38.831
Why are you so happy? It makes me nervous.

1030
00:59:39.081 --> 00:59:40.714
Did she cause any trouble?

1031
00:59:40.738 --> 00:59:41.979
I don't need the recipt.

1032
00:59:42.596 --> 00:59:43.588
Sir.

1033
00:59:44.831 --> 00:59:46.417
Dae-hyun, pick up your call.

1034
00:59:46.442 --> 00:59:47.167
Something happened!

1035
00:59:47.192 --> 00:59:48.222
Why?

1036
00:59:48.246 --> 00:59:49.244
Your girlfriend is not meeting you?

1037
00:59:49.362 --> 00:59:50.565
