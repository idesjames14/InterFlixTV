00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.010
(Ji Chang-wook)

(Kim You-jung)

3
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.990
(Backstreet Rookie)

4
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.840
Mr. Choi, don't you think you're too good
at dancing?

5
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.770
You think I became a boss with nothing?

6
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.680
I became one
because I won the dance battle.

7
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.380
Please call me Dancing Machine
from now on.

8
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.850
That's all for today.

9
00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.490
Goodbye.

10
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.259
See you again, Mr. Choi.

11
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.180
What a realistic dream that was.

12
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.990
You are a grass leaf,
I am the morning dew

13
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.620
I love you

14
00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:04.729
That dummy is better at it.

15
00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.690
Do it more. Give it another try.

16
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.330
-Only you
-Welcome.

17
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.430
-Here.
-I'll ring it up.

18
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.300
Are you a newbie?

19
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.300
Hey, where's the old man?

20
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.110
Maybe he died because he's so old.

21
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.079
That'll be 7.5 dollars in total.

22
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.240
Here.

23
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.280
-Let's go.
-Keep the receipt.

24
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.250
Let's go!

25
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.920
Excuse me? Sir?

26
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.090
How dare those brats?

27
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.430
I'm only going to stay quiet
to save Mr. Choi some fuss.

28
00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.360
Welcome.

29
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.840
I'll take one Camel Blue, please.

30
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.420
You're Professor Kang from "Sky Castle"!

31
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.720
You abandoned your daughter!

32
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.020
It's you, right? It is!

33
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.420
Could you sign an autograph for me?
Hold on.

34
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.790
My goodness, I need paper.

35
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.000
Here. Could you sign on this receipt?

36
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.500
-I have paper here.
-Sorry?

37
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.300
What's your name?

38
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.440
It's Jung Saet-byul.

39
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.579
-Jung Saet-byul.
-My goodness!

40
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.810
Do you mind taking a photo with me?
I've never seen a celebrity before.

41
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.650
-Sure.
-Really? Thank you.

42
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.350
One, two, three.

43
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.020
I look great, don't I? Thank you.

44
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.890
Oh, right. That'll be 4.5 dollars.

45
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.560
Keep the change.

46
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.570
You're so cool.

47
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.340
What?

48
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.370
Am I late?

49
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.580
I overslept!

50
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.680
Where's my phone?

51
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.680
Right, I have a part-timer at the store.

52
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.050
What time is it right now?

53
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.260
It's 5 a.m.

54
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.230
It must be the toughest hour for her.

55
00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.560
Darn it! I was so close!

56
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.100
Let's go home now.

57
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.470
-Let's go.
-Let's go home.

58
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.800
I'm so full.

59
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.100
What should we do with this?

60
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.970
Why are you even thinking about it?
She'll do it.

61
00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.409
Hey you! Clean this up.

62
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.110
-He's such an idiot.
-Let's go.

63
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.409
Seriously?

64
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.920
Excuse me, you have to clean up
after yourself.

65
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.090
-You clean it up for us.
-Just ignore her. Let's go.

66
00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.330
Seriously?

67
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.460
I'm only not fighting you
because I saw a celebrity today.

68
00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.770
We all lie, tell you the truth

69
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.000
Shout it out

70
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.300
My goodness!

71
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.670
Welcome!

72
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.140
I'll ring it up.

73
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.880
That'll be 1.7 dollars.

74
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:15.120
I'm the employee of
this store's headquarters.

75
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.790
I'm close with the owner here.
Is he not here today?

76
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.890
Sorry?

77
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.060
He works the day shift.

78
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.860
Can you tell him
that I'm taking one of these?

79
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.930
We don't run a tab for anyone here.

80
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.159
I'll talk to him.

81
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.270
No.

82
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.400
All right, fine.

83
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.610
What a day it has been.

84
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.880
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Director.

85
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.050
-Hello.
-Good morning!

86
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.320
Good morning, Director.

87
00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.820
Director Cho, I was jogging this morning,

88
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.120
and guess where I went.

89
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.560
Where did you go?

90
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.590
I visited Choi Dae-hyun's
convenience store.

91
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.730
But sir, there's only one part-timer
and she's a girl.

92
00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.730
Choi Dae-hyun always acts
as if he's so righteous and all,

93
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.300
but he's so dirty on the inside.

94
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.240
He hired an eye candy for his part-timer.

95
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.740
-Really?
-No way.

96
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.310
She's so young.

97
00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:19.950
I can see why male customers would
want to go back.

98
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.180
Lucky Choi Dae-hyun.

99
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.690
He gets to be with her all the time.

100
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.330
-Ms. Yoo, have you seen her?
-Do I have to?

101
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.830
You shouldn't be so cool about it.

102
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.770
I'm just worrying for you, that's all.

103
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.400
Thank you for your concern.

104
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.340
Let's begin the meeting.

105
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.070
Yes, ma'am!
Let's look at the analysis first.

106
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.640
Yes, as you can see,

107
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:49.840
fish mint, along with other oriental
fermenting ingredients...

108
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.380
You are a grass leaf

109
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:54.650
I am the morning dew

110
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:57.220
(Daily Guru)

111
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.450
(Daily Guru!)

112
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.320
(Today's Horoscopes for Saet-byul)

113
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:03.960
(Knock, and the door shall open today.)

114
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.730
(Just butt your head like a bulldozer!)

115
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:11.070
Okay, perfect. I haven't had a day
this lucky since forever.

116
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.540
I can't just waste this day away.

117
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.780
Sir, you said that you'd come yesterday,
and you're still not here.

118
00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:28.750
It's urgent.

119
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.420
Yes. We're open late
since it's a convenience store.

120
00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:35.190
-Mr. Choi!
-Yes, please have it delivered by today.

121
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.360
Please and thank you.

122
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.760
What is it? Is there something wrong?

123
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.100
Saet-byul, we have a package coming today.
Please make sure to receive it.

124
00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:43.159
What is it?

125
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.070
That's something you don't need to know.

126
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:50.909
Saet-byul,

127
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.710
you look different today.

128
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.280
Saet-byul, hold on.

129
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.590
Sorry?

130
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:07.960
Saet-byul,

131
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.600
I think we're going to have lots
of customers today. What do you think?

132
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.430
I think we can make it to 200.
You said your record is 188, right?

133
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.200
Let's get 200 customers today.

134
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.500
Challenge accepted!

135
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.010
Yes, always challenge yourself.

136
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:26.670
When my father was working at night,
we barely had 30 customers.

137
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:29.580
But with you, look here.

138
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.880
We get at least 150 customers per night.

139
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.679
What are you doing?

140
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.850
I thought I smelled cologne on you.
I guess not.

141
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.390
Mr. Choi, what are you doing
after your shift?

142
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.790
After my shift? I don't know.

143
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.430
You're a Libra.
Libras have bad luck today,

144
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.500
so it'll be very dangerous for you
to be out and about.

145
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.070
But Leos can save you from bad luck,

146
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.600
and I'm a Leo.

147
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:58.240
So, Mr. Choi, I think it'll be perfect
if you stay with me today.

148
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.440
Who said that?

149
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.610
-Daily Guru said so. It's very accurate.
-(Daily Guru!)

150
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.320
Daily Guru?

151
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.390
I have something I'd like to ask
Daily Guru about you.

152
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:12.620
About me?

153
00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.790
What is it? I can tell you the answer.

154
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.660
Can you tell me when you will

155
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.500
stop talking back to me
and just get to work?

156
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.070
I'm working very hard already.

157
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.870
You are, right?
Let's get to 200 customers tonight.

158
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.710
I'm leaving now.
Good luck, Saet-byul! Work hard!

159
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.310
Mr. Choi, wait!

160
00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.850
I'm a Leo,

161
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:41.320
-so you need to stay with me.
-Whatever.

162
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:42.680
Just get to work!

163
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:45.190
What's wrong with you today?

164
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:46.920
Head back inside.

165
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.290
Let me just walk you up to there.

166
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.430
No, I'm fine. Head inside.

167
00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.860
Get back inside and work.

168
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.500
Bye now!

169
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.400
Why is she so bright today?
It's making me anxious.

170
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:01.900
She won't cause trouble again, will she?
Darn it.

171
00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.370
You'll come back later, right?
You'll need me!

172
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:07.940
Saet-byul, were you waiting for me?

173
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.010
You're even wearing a new shirt.

174
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.180
Saet-byul?

175
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.320
(Banana milk)

176
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:17.150
It's not expired yet.

177
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:22.420
You didn't call me here just to give me
some almost-expired milk.

178
00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.530
It's about Eun-byul.

179
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.260
What about Eun-byul?

180
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.330
You don't think she secretly hangs out
with bad kids,

181
00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:33.800
do you?

182
00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.470
-Sorry?
-You know,

183
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.440
I get worried
around this time of the year.

184
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.580
Don't you trust me,
the ultimate human detector?

185
00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.250
There's nothing fishy about Eun-byul.

186
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.990
Really? I'll take your word on this.

187
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.190
-All right.
-Welcome!

188
00:10:55.260 --> 00:10:57.590
-Wait for me here.
-What should I get?

189
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.630
I'm going to die early
because of Eun-byul.

190
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.700
How much is this?

191
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.270
How much?

192
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.280
-That'll be a dollar.
-A dollar?

193
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.080
Jae-hyuk.
I don't need to buy anything. Let's go.

194
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.480
Seems like we've got nothing to buy.

195
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.350
Bye.

196
00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.890
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

197
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.360
-I got this.
-Nice job.

198
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.720
Well done.

199
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.200
Hey, watch the store for me.

200
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:39.000
Just let them be. Don't cause a scene.

201
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.370
My boss will cause one if I let them be.

202
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.370
Hey! Saet-byul!

203
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.880
You can't just leave me here!

204
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.320
Sure she can.

205
00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.560
My goodness! How can you even look

206
00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:07.830
so perfect in a uniform? Check that out.

207
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.170
I look so adorable.

208
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.340
-Let me go!
-Get over here!

209
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:30.890
Welcome.

210
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.090
Thank you very much for visiting
our store.

211
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:37.490
Why are you here? Where's Dae-hyun?

212
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.630
You better know how lucky you were
that day.

213
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.630
As you should, too.

214
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.270
They say that you meet your enemy
at the worst time and place.

215
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.570
Seems like this must be it.

216
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.370
No, this is just a convenience store.

217
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.070
Don't you know metaphors, you idiot?

218
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.470
You're even more of an idiot.
And did you go gambling or something?

219
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.770
Your entire outfit is a jackpot.

220
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.610
-You're covered in roses.
-I'm going to smack you.

221
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.540
I'm going to smack you!

222
00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.510
-Gosh.
-Go ahead. Hit me.

223
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.980
-Seriously!
-Hit me.

224
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:05.720
-You're so ugly.
-Get out of my way.

225
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:06.690
I was just about to.

226
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:08.690
What's wrong with you?

227
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.460
-Hello!
-Hello...

228
00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:14.430
-Hey!
-Why is she so scary?

229
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.330
Hold up, you prick!
Next time you see me, I'll kill you!

230
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.300
You're so ugly.

231
00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.300
How annoying.

232
00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.640
That startled me!

233
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.180
Darn it. Who are you?

234
00:13:34.650 --> 00:13:37.990
Thank you for being at the perfect place
for me to beat you all up.

235
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.850
-Are you crazy?
-How did you get here?

236
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.290
You guys were just stealing
left and right.

237
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.890
We're always like this.

238
00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.530
The old man lets us off the hook,
so why are you acting up?

239
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.130
Because I can't watch such a thing.

240
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.300
Close your eyes next time, then.

241
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:56.140
We're gentlemen, so we don't hit girls.

242
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.410
-Of course.
-Just leave.

243
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.370
Just leave already!

244
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:03.010
Really? I love beating men up.

245
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.510
You can just get beaten up, then.

246
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.350
What is she talking about?

247
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.780
Oh, my.

248
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:11.090
Kid, you won't be able to work
if you get hospitalized.

249
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.250
I won't be able to visit you all
at the hospital because I have work.

250
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.560
-Get rid of her.
-Gosh.

251
00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.990
Take care of it, you guys.

252
00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.130
-How absurd.
-You're really asking for it.

253
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.560
Hold on. Does anyone know
what Wolf's bane symbolizes?

254
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.530
I'll let you off the hook if you do.

255
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.470
Let me give you a hint. It's your future.

256
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.500
What, stealing more
from the convenience store?

257
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:31.770
Hearing you be obedient to us?

258
00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.540
Taking your paycheck?

259
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.610
Come here. Let me just beat you up.

260
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.810
How dare a tiny thing like you

261
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.450
approach us like this?

262
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.550
I'm bleeding! You!

263
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.060
-I'm borrowing this.
-Give it back!

264
00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.760
You're nothing but a part-timer.

265
00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:58.130
How dare you?

266
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:01.340
You're dead today.

267
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:14.650
How can these idiots get beaten up
by a girl?

268
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.050
I'm a little different, kid.

269
00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.490
How dare you?

270
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:26.330
My hand!

271
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.070
Hey!

272
00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:33.770
Darn it.

273
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.640
(Wolf's bane symbolizes
misanthropy and death.)

274
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.480
Stealing someone else's property is bad.

275
00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.020
It's a crime.

276
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.750
Bring the list of everything you've stolen
with the money to pay for them.

277
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.220
I'll be able to become
an official part-timer, then!

278
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:00.360
Seriously?

279
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:05.830
And don't throw your change at me
when you're buying from the store.

280
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.970
Would you like it
if I threw things at you?

281
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.370
That's called manners.

282
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:14.340
Understood?

283
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.840
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

284
00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.250
Dae-hyun, pick up the phone.
It's an emergency.

285
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:30.520
Aren't you Mr. Choi's friend?

286
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.400
-What a surprise to see you here.
-Hello.

287
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.530
Are you calling Mr. Choi?

288
00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.740
No, I'm just calling my parents
in Onyang, South Chungcheong Province,

289
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.410
just to check up on how they're doing.

290
00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.280
What a great son you are.

291
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.050
Did you happen to see anything back there?

292
00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.380
No, I didn't see anything.

293
00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.319
I severely lack in Vitamin A,
so I have a terrible night vision.

294
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:04.630
I'm practically blind at night,

295
00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.560
so I can only tell people by smell.

296
00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:10.760
I see.

297
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.300
Be careful on your way home, then.

298
00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Okay.

299
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.900
-It was nice seeing you.
-You too.

300
00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:21.280
Bye!

301
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.480
What a scoundrel she is.

302
00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.120
Since when did Shinseong-dong become
so sketchy?

303
00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.000
Gosh, what are you doing here, Yeon-joo?

304
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.770
This isn't like you.

305
00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.040
Who on earth turned you into this stalker?

306
00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.610
He hired an eye candy for his part-timer.

307
00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.220
Ms. Yoo, you really haven't seen her yet?

308
00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:06.150
No.

309
00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:09.890
I'm here to check out the store
as an employee

310
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.490
of the headquarters.

311
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.230
If I have to describe myself,
I'd be like a secret royal inspector.

312
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.260
(Here comes)

313
00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:22.400
(the secret royal inspector!)

314
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:26.940
(Jung Saet-byul)

315
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.110
Excuse me. Can you ring these up?

316
00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.880
-It's 20 dollars.
-Okay. Here you go.

317
00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.020
Goodness, girl.

318
00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.760
I can tell that you have
very high standards. I got you.

319
00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:20.560
But I'm really sorry to break it to you.
I'm not into that.

320
00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:21.960
Pardon?

321
00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.860
You know? I like men.

322
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:25.930
Sure thing. I didn't say anything.

323
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.370
But why are you asking me for my number?
You gave me your phone. That's adorable.

324
00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:32.470
I want you to run the transaction
with my phone.

325
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:33.810
What's that?

326
00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:36.610
You really don't know?
This replaces a physical card.

327
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.210
I see. Oh, that? I've heard of that.
I know what it is,

328
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.180
but I only use cash.

329
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:43.880
Please run it quickly.

330
00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.550
Wait, so what am I supposed
to do with this?

331
00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:48.920
What do I do?

332
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.690
Girl, if you had cash, you should've paid
with that from the get-go.

333
00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:05.970
Seriously. I know that
men dig anyone young and interesting.

334
00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:09.180
But she doesn't look young or interesting.
How am I supposed to understand this?

335
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:10.840
Gosh, I came here to get mad,

336
00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:13.050
but it makes me angrier
that there's nothing to be mad about.

337
00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.380
It's only ruining my style.

338
00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.050
-Come on.
-I was just kidding.

339
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.390
-Seriously.
-That's too much.

340
00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.920
But I'm really happy to be drinking
with former colleagues today.

341
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.560
It's been a while.

342
00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:26.330
-I agree.
-Hey, you guys.

343
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:28.160
I'm going to use the restroom.

344
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.730
-You don't have to tell us that.
-She's cute.

345
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:35.740
Dae-hyun, you'd better keep this in mind.

346
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:39.540
I know this because
I'm dating a colleague in secret.

347
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:42.210
Director Cho likes Ms. Yoo.

348
00:20:42.410 --> 00:20:45.110
Well, he can't make his move on her
because she's involved with you.

349
00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.450
But he's the son of the chairman.

350
00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:49.020
If he wants something, I'm sure
nothing will stop him from pursuing it.

351
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.550
Hey, stop it. Stop talking nonsense.

352
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:57.760
If you have time to talk nonsense,
you should have one more drink.

353
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.430
You insolent girl! Where have you been?

354
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.500
Your Highness,
I had to deal with those thugs.

355
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.770
What? Tell me how you handled them.

356
00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.440
I completely destroyed them.

357
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.850
Let me award you a big present.

358
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.150
Hurry and give me a high-five.

359
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.220
Gosh.

360
00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:26.420
Your Highness,
why don't you take that off now?

361
00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.220
If you want me to take it off, I will.

362
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.260
Cut! Let's stop there. That was perfect.

363
00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.490
Did my acting improve?

364
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.630
Yes, of course. Hey, nothing happened
while I was away, right?

365
00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:36.830
Didn't you have customers?

366
00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.470
A lot of guys came in,
but they left without buying anything.

367
00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:41.600
Hey, you and I are different.

368
00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:42.700
Come on.

369
00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:46.470
Hey, there was an awful customer,
but he left.

370
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.510
An awful customer?
There was an awful customer?

371
00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.080
Whatever. Forget it.

372
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:55.150
On top of that, there was a lady
who had a total crush on me.

373
00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.020
What are you talking about?

374
00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:00.590
It's true. She had really high standards.

375
00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:02.690
I told her that I wasn't into girls.

376
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.630
I had to comfort and reason with her.
It was so hard to send her away.

377
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:08.460
Hey, have a cool can of beer.

378
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:10.860
No beer for me. Instead of drinking this,

379
00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.430
you should drink expensive liquor,
so our sales go up.

380
00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:14.740
You're breaking my heart.

381
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:17.040
-Drink some more, so our sales go up.
-Seriously?

382
00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:19.670
-Hey, Saet-byul.
-Mr. Choi, you're back.

383
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.610
Hey, you with curly hair.

384
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:23.480
You should go now. Clean up before you go.

385
00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:25.380
-Hey, you.
-Make sure you pay!

386
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:29.020
Did you come back because you missed me?
Do you know what I did today?

387
00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.880
Of course, I do.

388
00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.490
You must have gotten my package.
Give me the package.

389
00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:35.020
And this is for you.

390
00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:36.660
-What's that?
-It's hotteok.

391
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.260
-Hotteok?
-Give me my package.

392
00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:42.360
Goodness. Whose package is this?

393
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.230
Let's see. All right.

394
00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:53.510
Saet-byul, what do you think?

395
00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:56.040
It's nice. You have good eyes.
Who is that for?

396
00:22:56.210 --> 00:22:58.810
"Father, it's a gift from me."

397
00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.420
"My gosh, Dae-hyun. You know me so well."

398
00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.020
"This is perfect for me. I love it."

399
00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:05.390
What are you doing?

400
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.460
You said that was for your father.
So I was pretending to be your father.

401
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.790
Hey, this is... Forget it.
You don't have to know.

402
00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.460
Wait, Mr. Choi. If this is a present,
you should remove the tag.

403
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:19.800
Yes, you're right. Thank you.

404
00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:22.670
Throw this out for me.

405
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:23.970
-Throw it out?
-Yes.

406
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:26.740
It's...

407
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.510
Hey, Yeon-joo.

408
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.480
(Hey, Dae-hyun.
I was just about to call you.)

409
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:37.650
Really? Why?

410
00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.490
That darn Yeon-joo.

411
00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.230
I told you to fire that part-timer before.

412
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.030
I think I overstepped.

413
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:48.930
I will respect your decision.

414
00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.200
Why did you have a sudden change of heart?

415
00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:56.040
I only told you that because I was worried
about her safety as a woman.

416
00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.110
So don't mind me. Just be nice to her.

417
00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.710
Teach her about the store and how to
run the transactions on the phone.

418
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.110
She's good at her job.

419
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.810
Oh, right. Why did you call me?

420
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:10.150
Oh, right. Yeon-joo, isn't tomorrow

421
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.920
your father's birthday?

422
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:13.650
Yes, how do you know that?

423
00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.790
Of course, I know. I know everything.

424
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.820
After hearing that last year from you,

425
00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.190
I marked the date,
so I can say hello to your dad.

426
00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.460
I see. I didn't know.

427
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.700
Dae-hyun.

428
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:29.840
My dad hasn't been feeling well lately.
He wants a small family gathering

429
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.040
at home.

430
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.240
I see. At home?

431
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:35.340
Okay, then.

432
00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.480
I guess I won't be able to meet
your dad again, right?

433
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:41.880
I'm sorry.
I'll try to introduce you to him soon.

434
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.580
No, it's okay. Don't be sorry. I'm okay.

435
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:47.020
Just help your dad feel better.

436
00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.020
That's the most important thing.
We can meet next time.

437
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:53.030
Okay. You should hang up first.

438
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.830
Okay, Yeon-joo.

439
00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.630
What's wrong? Your girlfriend
doesn't want to meet up?

440
00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.770
Why did you eavesdrop?

441
00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.970
What? I wasn't eavesdropping!

442
00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:05.540
You were talking to her so loudly
right in front of the counter.

443
00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.110
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

444
00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.680
Hey, I'm going to refund...

445
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:13.980
Oh, no. Why did you rip this?

446
00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.250
You told me to throw this out.

447
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.350
No.

448
00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:22.190
-Piece them back together.
-What?

449
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:24.020
-Piece them back together.
-How can I do that?

450
00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:25.930
I don't know. Just make it work.

451
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.130
You have to piece them back together.

452
00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.260
Me?

453
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.600
Hey, Jin-young.

454
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:35.770
As it so happens,
my plans tomorrow got canceled.

455
00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.770
So I can make it to the reunion.

456
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.640
Where is that again?

457
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:41.010
(It's in Pyeongchang-dong.)

458
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:43.710
(There's a Chinese restaurant
near Professor Kim's house.)

459
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:48.520
I see. Pyeongchang-dong?
Okay. See you tomorrow. Bye.

460
00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:54.120
Why does it have to be
in Pyeongchang-dong?

461
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:59.560
Dad! Dad.

462
00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:00.830
What?

463
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:02.060
Where are you going?

464
00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:03.400
I just bought bean sprouts.

465
00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:05.770
Your mother wants to have
bean sprout soup tomorrow morning.

466
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:07.270
-Bye.
-Okay.

467
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:15.940
Dad.

468
00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:18.010
What?

469
00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.120
Dad, do you want to have a drink with me?

470
00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:28.420
No, I'm good.

471
00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:31.460
Dad. Just one drink, please?

472
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.790
-You asked me to have drinks with you.
-Yes.

473
00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:36.430
Make sure your mother knows that.

474
00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.470
My gosh, you don't have
to worry about Mom.

475
00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.640
Let's go.
Hey, should we mix soju and beer?

476
00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.540
-Dae-hyun.
-Yes, Dad.

477
00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.870
-I love you.
-Me too.

478
00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.010
Okay.

479
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:52.910
Oh, my. Look at you. You drank a lot
when you went out to buy bean sprouts.

480
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.020
-You know?
-Right.

481
00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.450
Mom, here.

482
00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.390
I asked him to get drinks with me.
I really did.

483
00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.360
That's all right. I'm glad.

484
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:04.760
What?

485
00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.530
-Dad.
-What will you do

486
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:07.760
if you're not okay with it?

487
00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.800
I had a drink tonight. So what?

488
00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:15.100
Don't just stand there.
Make me honey water. You useless--

489
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.670
Dad. Please get yourself together.
Mom is right here.

490
00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.210
Let go of me. So what if she's here?

491
00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.010
You scowl at me
because you make some money.

492
00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.280
You always try to pick a fight with me.

493
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.850
I should just kick you in the--

494
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:35.690
-Mom, cut him some slack.
-It's all right.

495
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.960
Goodness. This macho man is having

496
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.160
a tough time being a househusband.

497
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:42.900
This is the only time
he can unleash himself.

498
00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:44.760
Take off your socks.

499
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.630
-Get off me!
-Mom.

500
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:48.870
Gosh, you're so strong.

501
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:53.670
When the play is over

502
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:57.440
Alone in the audience

503
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:58.410
Jang-mi.

504
00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:02.480
I love you.

505
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:08.820
(Seven colors make Rainbow)

506
00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.830
When the play is over

507
00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:18.470
Alone in the audience

508
00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:22.170
The lights are turned off

509
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:26.440
Gosh, Jang-pil.

510
00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.520
I love you.

511
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.920
Avalokita Bodhisattva

512
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:43.060
was moving in the deep course

513
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.830
of the Wisdom which has gone beyond--

514
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:47.030
Mom.

515
00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.830
Dad has been stressed out
with the house chores--

516
00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.100
Go to your room and go to sleep.

517
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:55.340
-Dad--
-Do you want to get beaten up too?

518
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:57.070
No. Goodnight.

519
00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:03.940
Jang-mi.

520
00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.650
(Bibimmyeon)

521
00:29:13.290 --> 00:29:14.950
Anyone here?

522
00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:17.860
Sir. What do you need?

523
00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.390
It's not that.

524
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.400
Do you happen to like tripe, Saet-byul?

525
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.730
Tripe? I can't get enough of it.

526
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.700
Right? The tripe was really fresh.

527
00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:30.540
So I grilled some for you.

528
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.340
Really?

529
00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:35.280
My gosh, I should have come earlier
before you opened up cup noodles.

530
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.040
Oh, this? I can eat this with tripe.

531
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.980
Right. Dig in.

532
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.220
This is so good.

533
00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:45.080
I only buy good-quality tripe.

534
00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:47.550
-Goodnight.
-Okay. Thank you.

535
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.360
-Bye. Sure.
-Thank you for the food.

536
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.860
-I'll return the plate.
-Okay.

537
00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:12.810
What is this? They go so well together.

538
00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.010
It's so good.

539
00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:19.820
(Come and eat.)

540
00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.360
Seeing how you're dressed up,
I guess you're going out.

541
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:28.430
Yes.

542
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:32.800
(Yeon-joo's Father's Birthday)

543
00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:35.940
I have a reunion today.
I told Saet-byul to come to work early.

544
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.870
Don't drink too much.

545
00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.910
If you drink too much,
you'll turn into your dad.

546
00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.040
I won't.

547
00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.910
-What about Dad?
-He's alive.

548
00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:47.550
Yong-pil.

549
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.290
-I'm fine. It's just my hand.
-Okay.

550
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:06.570
That's enough.

551
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.410
Mom, you were really patient.

552
00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.780
Eat some kimchi.

553
00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.960
-Eun-byul, yesterday, I was summoned
-Yes.

554
00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:33.390
to the convenience store.

555
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:35.500
Why? For what?

556
00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.830
Because of you.

557
00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:40.200
Did you know your sister found out
you've been running with the wrong crowd?

558
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.640
As long as you don't say anything,
she'll never find out.

559
00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.170
Hey, when did I say
I'd turn a blind eye to that?

560
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.670
I gave you time to clean it up.

561
00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.740
You'd better clean that up quickly.

562
00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.840
If she catches you, I'll be dead meat too.

563
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:53.450
I really want to graduate this year.

564
00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.910
Okay. Fine.

565
00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.880
-By the way,
-What?

566
00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.390
when my sister dropped out of school,

567
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.290
why did you stop coming to school?

568
00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.720
Back then,

569
00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.060
-I was loyal.
-That's not true.

570
00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:10.830
According to my sister,
you used my sister as an excuse.

571
00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.530
You didn't want to go to school.

572
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.600
You're just like your sister.

573
00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:16.200
Just eat that.

574
00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:19.110
It's good.

575
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.440
Mr. Choi.

576
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:25.610
Hey, Saet-byul. You're here.

577
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:28.080
Did you ask me to come early
because you missed me?

578
00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:30.850
No, that's not it.
I'm going to a reunion today.

579
00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.320
But the way you dressed up
is totally to my liking.

580
00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.390
This is how I always dress,
Ms. Temporary Part-timer.

581
00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.830
-Don't I look cool?
-I doubt it.

582
00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:43.000
Are you wearing cologne?

583
00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.960
-Hey, stop that.
-Are you not?

584
00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:46.530
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

585
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:49.070
-Isn't your zodiac sign Libra?
-Yes.

586
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.200
You'll get very lucky
in the romance department.

587
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.340
Really? I'll get lucky? How?

588
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.110
All of your efforts will come to nothing.

589
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:01.510
Sure. That sounds so great. Thank you.

590
00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:03.450
You shouldn't see your girlfriend today.

591
00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.780
I can't see her anyway.

592
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.220
-Really?
-Yes.

593
00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:08.250
Hey, you're living in a high-tech era.

594
00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.090
How can you believe in such horoscopes?
It's very out-dated.

595
00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.360
Don't you agree, young lady?

596
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:13.990
-Look.
(-Daily Guru!)

597
00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.900
Daily Guru is my religion.

598
00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.070
My fortune tomorrow isn't good.

599
00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.600
Gosh, why are you so mean to me?

600
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:26.010
Right. Mr. Choi, can you fill in
for me tomorrow? I have plans.

601
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:29.540
Sure. Have a good day. I'm leaving now.

602
00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:32.280
-Dae-hyun, I need to talk to you
-Okay.

603
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:33.380
about your part-timer.

604
00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:35.850
Hey, I was actually going
to ask you to help me.

605
00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.950
Can you fill in for her tomorrow night?

606
00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.750
There are a lot of expired meal boxes.
Eat them.

607
00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:42.160
-I'm late. Bye.
-Hey, that's not important.

608
00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:44.760
There's something you must know
about your part-timer!

609
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.430
You must know the evil side of her.

610
00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.670
Hello.

611
00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.270
Hi.

612
00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.710
Why are you here at this hour, Saet-byul?

613
00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.179
It sounded like
you needed to talk to Mr. Choi.

614
00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:07.150
No.

615
00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:10.880
You said there was something about me
he had to know. What is that about?

616
00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.489
I'm the part-timer you mentioned.

617
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:16.989
-My hand!
-Hey.

618
00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:19.790
Part...

619
00:34:35.739 --> 00:34:37.409
Goodbye.

620
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.780
(Backstreet Rookie)

621
00:34:43.805 --> 00:34:46.420
I'd like to toast for the success of
our fellow classmates

622
00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:49.190
from Taesung University and for the health
of Professor Kim Sin-woo.

623
00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:51.190
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

624
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.260
We should have eaten
at a restaurant near our school.

625
00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.500
Why did you pick such a fancy place?

626
00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.930
We're not students anymore.

627
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.800
And one of us made a fortune
through investments.

628
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:03.670
-Really? Who is that?
-Who is that?

629
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:05.810
Tell me about that investment.

630
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:09.540
Sir, I don't think it will work for you.
It's the Girlfriend Investment.

631
00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:12.350
-Girlfriend?
-Girlfriend Investment?

632
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:14.750
Hey, that's not a nice way
to describe my relationship.

633
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:17.620
-Come on.
-She's a team leader who studied abroad.

634
00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.990
She's a beautiful older lady.
And she comes from a rich family.

635
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:23.290
-My goodness. Really?
-Is that true?

636
00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.930
Sir, no. He's just kidding.
Don't believe what he tells you.

637
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:29.200
Hurry up and marry her
before she changes her mind.

638
00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.660
-Shouldn't you?
-The next time we meet,

639
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:33.930
it might be at Dae-hyun's wedding.

640
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:36.900
-Congratulations.
-Good for you.

641
00:35:36.970 --> 00:35:38.340
Congratulations in advance.

642
00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.870
-Congratulations.
-This is why a guy needs to be handsome.

643
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:43.510
I'd love to date a woman like her.

644
00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:53.350
Director Cho,
don't make Yeon-joo work too hard.

645
00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.820
Gosh, you don't need to worry.

646
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:09.840
What's that?

647
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:13.840
Happy birthday, sir.

648
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:15.810
My goodness.

649
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:19.750
Goodness.

650
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:21.310
Gosh, what a nice gift.

651
00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.020
It's a luxury brand. Thank you.

652
00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:37.160
You know what?
Let's go home and have wine together.

653
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:39.100
We have a really nice bottle of wine.

654
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:42.640
Yes, it's been sitting around for ages.
I guess you'll finally get to drink it.

655
00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.640
Let's get going now.

656
00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:50.240
Dad, you look really happy today.

657
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:52.980
-Yes, I'm very happy.
-It's all thanks to Seung-joon.

658
00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:56.480
Thank you for the meal.

659
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.060
(If her parents are rich,)

660
00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:14.630
(they might think you're dating her
because of her money.)

661
00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.540
Have you met your girlfriend's parents?

662
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.640
-I bet he has.
-They've been dating for two years.

663
00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.940
-They've been together for a while.
-Actually, no.

664
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.110
-Not yet?
-I plan to meet them soon.

665
00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:26.410
-Really?
-You've been together for over two years,

666
00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.680
but you still haven't met them?

667
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:30.520
Dae-hyun, get your act straight.

668
00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:33.850
I heard rich people date just for fun
and marry people from similar backgrounds.

669
00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.390
-I heard that too.
-It's pretty common.

670
00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:37.990
-My gosh, you startled me.
-What was that for?

671
00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:43.460
-Hey. You guys.
-Gosh, you punk.

672
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:47.130
Don't mind me. Just focus on your lives.

673
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.870
Just drop the subject and have a drink.

674
00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.970
I want all of you to get wasted.

675
00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.810
-Okay, fine.
-Let's drink.

676
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:56.440
-Let's get wasted!
-Let's drink!

677
00:37:56.510 --> 00:37:58.680
Let's go to karaoke
after we finish drinking here.

678
00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:01.880
-Karaoke sounds nice!
-Let's go!

679
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:06.390
-I'm...
-Hey, look. Do you remember this day?

680
00:38:06.850 --> 00:38:08.990
Gosh, look how much you've grown.

681
00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:13.330
You were pretty even when you were young.

682
00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:16.860
Life is short. Enjoy it while you can.

683
00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:20.300
Seung-joon, are you making Yeon-joo
work at your company

684
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:22.200
so that she won't get a chance
to date anyone else?

685
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:23.670
Oh, yes.

686
00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.670
Your dad is waiting. Let's go.

687
00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:26.770
Okay.

688
00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:29.540
Let's go.

689
00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.960
Saet-byul, are you...

690
00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:49.730
What are you doing here?

691
00:38:51.430 --> 00:38:52.770
Why are you sitting here?

692
00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:56.370
You asked me for a new menu.

693
00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.010
So this time,
I plan to try something with noodles.

694
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.840
You know my Oh Gamja Cheese French Fries
are really popular, right?

695
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:05.910
If you plan to do something with noodles,
make it spicy.

696
00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.550
They say Koreans get their energy
from two things.

697
00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:11.780
We get energy from rice and spicy foods.

698
00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.890
But why do you look so down?

699
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:18.620
It looks like someone got you good.

700
00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:24.800
Make sure you add enough toppings

701
00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:26.430
so that it'll be filling.

702
00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.040
Toppings? How about chicken breasts
or sausages?

703
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.000
Sausages are too artificial.

704
00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:34.170
And chicken breasts are too dry.

705
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:36.380
Then what should I add?

706
00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:40.110
Why are you asking me?
It's your job to come up with it.

707
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:43.250
You're the one who asked me
to come up with a new menu.

708
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.680
Normally, other people

709
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:48.050
would just think of it as a conversation.

710
00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:53.060
I might as well
just throw my shoes at him.

711
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:05.170
Saet-byul, I heard that.

712
00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.740
-Really?
-Yes.

713
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:10.540
Please ring these up.

714
00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.410
Okay. Do you want a plastic bag?
It costs two cents.

715
00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.480
Yes.

716
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:22.990
Hey, Saet-byul. About...

717
00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.490
About that thing...

718
00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.960
What was the name of that app
that tells you your daily horoscope?

719
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.200
Daily Guru?

720
00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:34.300
Yes, Daily Guru.

721
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:37.540
Can you download it for me?

722
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:43.940
I guess I was right.
You really did have a disappointing day.

723
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:48.350
I'll download it for you.

724
00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:50.880
By the way,
why can't you come to work tomorrow?

725
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:52.550
I'm busy with something.

726
00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:53.690
With what?

727
00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.660
Just something.

728
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:59.290
Thanks.

729
00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:05.330
You're our 204th customer today.
Let me ring these up.

730
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:14.010
Here you go, our 204th customer.

731
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.740
Thanks.

732
00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:21.480
You're just going to leave? Mr. Choi.

733
00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:28.150
He didn't even check the cash register.

734
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:30.190
We got more than 200 customers today.

735
00:41:34.090 --> 00:41:37.100
Good job.
I'll soon become an official part-timer.

736
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:05.490
Daily Guru...

737
00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.100
(Today's Horoscopes for Dae-hyun)

738
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.370
(You will be overjoyed
and miserable today.)

739
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.470
Overjoyed and miserable about what?

740
00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.470
Gosh, forget it. Whatever.

741
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:23.380
"Overjoyed and miserable."

742
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.150
Dad, we're here.

743
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:31.780
(Jung Cheol-min)

744
00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.220
Have you been doing well?

745
00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:37.860
I'm here too. I didn't bring a letter
because I'm a high school senior.

746
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:45.400
Mr. Kim must've visited as well.
You must've been happy, Dad.

747
00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:46.630
You should stick yours too.

748
00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.700
Mine isn't that pretty.

749
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:57.480
(Award for Bravery)

750
00:42:57.540 --> 00:42:59.910
(Jung Cheol-min)

751
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.960
Okay, let's go! 1, 2, 3! Faster!

752
00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:20.930
Good job! That was great!

753
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.440
You did great! Great job!

754
00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:36.080
You're getting stronger every day.

755
00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.050
I'm going to beat you soon.

756
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:41.850
So you can do what?

757
00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.160
So I can stop you from working at night.

758
00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:46.330
The cops should be doing what you do.

759
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.930
The cops only punish them.
But I give them a positive influence.

760
00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.100
People like me are more capable
of helping those kids.

761
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.440
Who's supposed to protect our family
if you always leave the house at night?

762
00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:03.640
You, Saet-byul. You're my best work.

763
00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.450
I trust you, Saet-byul.

764
00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:22.530
We're trying hard to make sure
we don't disappoint you.

765
00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.700
So don't worry and rest in peace.

766
00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:31.570
(Yeon-joo, about yesterday...)

767
00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:38.410
(Yeon-joo, I saw everything yesterday.)

768
00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:42.650
They're coming.

769
00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.880
Give them this month's new products
and the promotional items.

770
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:46.720
Okay.

771
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:48.990
-Hello!
-Hi!

772
00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:50.120
Welcome.

773
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:53.030
Mr. Choi,
you look even more handsome today.

774
00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:54.330
-Thank you.
-My gosh.

775
00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:57.960
We're holding a BOGO event.
Would you like to take a look?

776
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:59.200
-Yes.
-Yes, show it to us.

777
00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:02.130
Let me show you. First, there's this.

778
00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.900
And along with that, you also get this.

779
00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:06.040
-I'll take that one.
-Me too.

780
00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:07.510
Give me your cell phone.

781
00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:09.740
Okay, everyone. In 1, 2...

782
00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:12.410
-Let me take a photo in 1, 2 3.
-Just a second.

783
00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:13.550
Okay.

784
00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:16.880
-Hey, Yeon-joo.
-"Yeon-joo"?

785
00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:21.450
Well, yes. I have time.

786
00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:23.790
-Where should we meet?
-He must have a date.

787
00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:25.620
I knew he had a girlfriend.

788
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:29.830
No, my son doesn't have a girlfriend.

789
00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.830
-Let's go somewhere else.
-Okay.

790
00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.470
Can I have my phone back?
See you next time.

791
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:34.770
-Bye.
-Bye.

792
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:37.140
I think there's a misunderstanding.
My son doesn't...

793
00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.040
I can't believe he had a girlfriend.

794
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:41.440
-I'm so disappointed.
-He even liked my post.

795
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:43.410
-Let's go.
-But... My goodness.

796
00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.610
-What's going on?
-My son doesn't have a girlfriend.

797
00:45:46.110 --> 00:45:48.780
What happened? Why? Where...
Where did they all go?

798
00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:51.820
They all just left, you punk.

799
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:54.520
Couldn't you answer the phone
a little later?

800
00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:56.990
They're the only customers we get
during the afternoon.

801
00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.390
You're such an idiot!

802
00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:00.360
Mom, I'll work twice as hard tomorrow.

803
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:02.290
I need to meet Yeon-joo right now.

804
00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:03.800
-What?
-Saet-byul is busy today,

805
00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.000
so Dal-sik will be here instead.

806
00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:07.630
Stay here until he comes. Bye, Mom.

807
00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.700
You little...

808
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:12.440
My goodness. What a pathetic punk.

809
00:46:13.140 --> 00:46:15.640
He's like a dog
wagging its tail for its owner.

810
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:17.840
Darn it. We're done for today.

811
00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:20.410
Yeon-joo, you don't like
sausage stew that much.

812
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:21.880
Do you have something to say?

813
00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:25.420
Remember how we promised
not to keep secrets from each other?

814
00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:26.490
Yes.

815
00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:29.190
You know Director Cho Seung-joon, right?

816
00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:33.860
He was at my dad's birthday party.

817
00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:36.460
He had dinner with us

818
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:38.400
and even had wine with us at our house.

819
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.800
Right. Yeon-joo--

820
00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:46.470
To be honest, we knew each other
before you were even born.

821
00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:49.040
Both our dads are really close,
so we were friends since we were born.

822
00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.210
You were friends with Director Cho,
the chairman's son,

823
00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.110
ever since you guys were young?

824
00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:56.720
But don't get mistaken.
I got the job because I deserved it.

825
00:46:57.050 --> 00:46:58.750
I got offers
from a lot of other companies.

826
00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:00.950
But I chose to work here
because I liked the company's vision.

827
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:06.060
No wonder.

828
00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.730
No wonder he seemed to be on your level.

829
00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.800
I get it now.
It's because you guys are friends.

830
00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:14.830
I guess it's not a big deal
if you guys are friends.

831
00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:19.810
The look on your face
after seeing my parents with Director Cho.

832
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:24.310
(Did I get caught?)

833
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.510
I tried to imagine it.

834
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.950
I figured you'd be upset if you found out.

835
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.520
Anyway, what matters
is that it's not a big deal.

836
00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:34.790
I did nothing to be ashamed of, okay?

837
00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:37.490
Why are you telling me this all of sudden?

838
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:39.460
I trust you.

839
00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:43.000
I have so much faith in you,
so you didn't need to tell me.

840
00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:46.160
But I'm grateful
that you opened up to me about it.

841
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:48.700
So be good to me. And don't get any ideas.

842
00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.640
-No, don't add the noodles.
-Got it.

843
00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.410
I don't like it when the soup gets thick.

844
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:55.810
I offered to eat sausage stew,
so it's your turn to yield.

845
00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.850
(Yeon-joo was honest with me,
but I was a coward.)

846
00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:04.850
(I couldn't tell her
that I was there that night)

847
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:08.490
(or that I didn't like the fact
that she's friends with Director Cho.)

848
00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:13.560
(And suddenly,
I felt like a block of instant noodles.)

849
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:16.560
(Yeon-joo, her parents, and Director Cho)

850
00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.330
(were like a good combination)

851
00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.100
(of ham, rice cakes, and vegetables
boiling in the same pot.)

852
00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.200
(And I just felt like)

853
00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:26.340
(a block of hard instant noodles
that couldn't join them.)

854
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.110
-Dae-hyun.
-Yes?

855
00:48:31.410 --> 00:48:33.480
Look at me with those eyes.

856
00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:38.050
Hello, everyone.

857
00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:39.480
Welcome to Munich Bar.

858
00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:41.120
-Hello.
-He was always like that.

859
00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.860
-Yes, you're right.
-We're newly opened. We have great food.

860
00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.190
Welcome. Our bar just opened.

861
00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.290
-The food here is great.
-When did it change?

862
00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:52.060
You're right. I guess we haven't been here
in a long time. Let's go somewhere else.

863
00:48:52.130 --> 00:48:53.630
-Yeon-joo.
-If you spend more than...

864
00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.730
Don't you want to see
if our seat is still there?

865
00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.740
The food here is very good.
You should come visit.

866
00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.870
-Let's check it out.
-I'm not sure.

867
00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.340
-Let's go.
-Welcome. The food here is great.

868
00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:04.210
Thank you. Come inside.

869
00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:06.280
The food here is really good. Come inside.

870
00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:08.150
This place has changed completely.

871
00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:09.920
-You're right.
-Yes.

872
00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:12.720
-Should we sit here?
-Sure.

873
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:14.950
Our seat is gone.

874
00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:16.520
-Exactly.
-Yes.

875
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:18.120
The waiter is here.

876
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:20.330
Yeon-joo, should we have just one drink?

877
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:22.630
Sure, that's fine with me.
You can order whatever.

878
00:49:22.690 --> 00:49:24.060
"Whatever"? Okay.

879
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:29.740
Do we get two glasses of beer
if we order the set menu?

880
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.600
-Yes.
-Then we'll have Set A.

881
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:34.070
-Okay, Set A.
-Thank you.

882
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:36.440
It comes with chicken
and some dried pollack.

883
00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:38.110
-Does it sound okay?
-Yes.

884
00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.710
-Welcome.
-Hello.

885
00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:42.550
-Hey, you're here.
-Hey.

886
00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.320
-What did you order?
-Have a seat.

887
00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:48.390
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

888
00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.560
Welcome.

889
00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.730
I'll take what I usually order, honey.

890
00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:57.830
We opened today.

891
00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:02.900
I was just kidding.

892
00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:05.040
Normally,
I'd ask for the bottle I left behind,

893
00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:08.940
but this looks like a cheap bar,
so that won't sound right.

894
00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:12.310
Honey, what do you want to eat?
I'll get you anything you want.

895
00:50:13.350 --> 00:50:15.650
Geum-bi, stop it.

896
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:17.450
What? I'm just trying to have fun.

897
00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:19.280
Honey, isn't this fun?

898
00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:23.220
You're the only one having fun.
The worker doesn't find it amusing at all.

899
00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.890
I bet he wants to punch you in the face,

900
00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.830
take your eyeballs out,
and just chew on them.

901
00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:34.670
Isn't that right?

902
00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:36.740
What would you like?

903
00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:39.270
We'll order Set A
and an extra glass of beer.

904
00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:40.870
Okay, Set A.

905
00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:44.280
-See you later, honey.
-Hey.

906
00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:46.210
-What?
-Your face scared him off.

907
00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:48.480
-This is called love.
-Are you going to come here tomorrow?

908
00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:49.750
I'm going to come here tomorrow.

909
00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:53.190
Yeon-joo, I'll be withdrawing
my installment savings soon.

910
00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:55.320
And I still have
the housing subscription account I made

911
00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:57.020
when I first got hired at our company.

912
00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.860
Why are you telling me that?

913
00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:02.830
You know, they say guys become mature
once they get married.

914
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:04.360
I disagree with that.

915
00:51:04.730 --> 00:51:06.230
They should be mature to begin with.

916
00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.300
It's useless to force oneself
to grow up after marriage.

917
00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:10.370
Yes, you do have a point.

918
00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:12.740
-But considering our age--
-Hello.

919
00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.870
We're here to promote a product.

920
00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:19.080
-Yeon-joo, this is--
-What's this?

921
00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:20.850
It's a product made by
a convenience store brand.

922
00:51:20.910 --> 00:51:23.950
It gets rid of your energy
and maximizes your hangover.

923
00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:28.590
(A totally different...)

924
00:51:28.615 --> 00:51:31.520
It gets rid of your energy
and maximizes...

925
00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.790
It maximizes your energy
and gets rid of your hangover.

926
00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.400
Okay, great.

927
00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

928
00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:42.470
Yeon-joo, isn't this the product
you worked on?

929
00:51:42.730 --> 00:51:45.000
Are they promoting the product
or boycotting it?

930
00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:47.410
Don't be like that.
She just got it all mixed up.

931
00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:49.040
-"It gets rid of--"
-Dae-hyun.

932
00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.680
Hello!

933
00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:55.810
It gets rid of your energy
and maximizes your hangover.

934
00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:59.850
It contains herbal medicine,
so it's great for your body!

935
00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:02.320
-It's great!
-Let's go.

936
00:52:03.050 --> 00:52:04.360
-Sir.
-Yes?

937
00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:05.690
You need to give us one more.

938
00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.690
-Oh, there are two of you.
-There are two people.

939
00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.230
What are you talking about?
There are three...

940
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:12.660
Where did she go?

941
00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.830
Just give us one more.

942
00:52:16.170 --> 00:52:19.340
-Okay, great!
-Great!

943
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.210
-Let's go.
-Okay.

944
00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:28.050
What just happened?

945
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:31.150
-Is he your ex-boyfriend?
-Are you nuts?

946
00:52:31.650 --> 00:52:34.550
I used to do that before I got a job
at the convenience store.

947
00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:36.760
-Then why did you hide?
-You idiot.

948
00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.360
-Is your brain an ornament?
-Yes, I think so.

949
00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.560
He's only working with that fool
because Saet-byul is

950
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:43.560
no longer available.

951
00:52:44.130 --> 00:52:47.230
You really know
how it feels not to have much.

952
00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.740
-Did you visit your dad?
-Yes.

953
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:57.480
-Did Eun-byul go too?
-Yes.

954
00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:59.240
How is she doing? Is she doing okay?

955
00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:01.050
Why wouldn't she be doing okay?

956
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.050
She's being raised by a great sister.

957
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:05.280
I miss Eun-byul.

958
00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:08.550
You can come see her at my house.
She's probably sleeping right now.

959
00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:13.230
That's what life is all about

960
00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.530
Everyone is born empty-handed

961
00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:20.100
Life is all about the present moment

962
00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:26.300
Amor fati

963
00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:33.380
Amor fati

964
00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.010
Amor fati

965
00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:41.890
(It was perfect!)

966
00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:44.360
(Nice one!)

967
00:53:47.690 --> 00:53:50.360
Hey, I got a perfect score.

968
00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:52.900
Will you forgive my friends now?

969
00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:57.370
Consider yourselves lucky
for having such a good friend.

970
00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.810
Eun-byul, you're an amazing singer.

971
00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:02.570
You should become an idol star.

972
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:07.880
She's going to audition.

973
00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:12.150
Really? You guys,
why don't we take a group photo

974
00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:14.050
to wish her good luck on her audition?

975
00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:16.760
-Gather together. Come here.
-Okay.

976
00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:18.520
Get on your knees.

977
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:21.490
Hey, get out of there. Come here.

978
00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:23.660
Eun-byul, you're a star. Get up.

979
00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:26.700
You're going to be an idol star,
so strike a pose and put your foot there.

980
00:54:26.770 --> 00:54:27.970
Place it on her leg.

981
00:54:28.030 --> 00:54:31.900
Make it look natural. Smile for me.

982
00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.270
-Let's keep it natural.
-Good job.

983
00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:35.340
Smile.

984
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:42.210
If we upload this on social media
after you become famous,

985
00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.950
it'll cause a pretty big issue.

986
00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:46.850
"Jung Eun-byul,
an idol star who used to be a bully."

987
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:50.420
Yes, exactly. There are tons of idol stars
who totally messed up their careers

988
00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:53.190
for being a bully in the past
regardless of how hard they worked.

989
00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:57.630
If anyone gets in the way of her success,
I'll teach that person a lesson.

990
00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:02.370
Eun-byul, don't worry about a thing.
Just work hard

991
00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:03.840
and make a lot of money.

992
00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:06.540
Okay, thank you.

993
00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.610
Let's split your income by half.

994
00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:13.810
My dream is to make tons of money
by becoming a talent agent.

995
00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.920
What are you laughing about?

996
00:55:21.490 --> 00:55:24.160
Hey, you'd better work hard.

997
00:55:24.220 --> 00:55:25.220
-Okay.
-Okay.

998
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:27.230
I heard Joon opened up a bar nearby.

999
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:30.430
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

1000
00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:34.470
-Gosh.
-Darn it.

1001
00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.300
Come on. Please?

1002
00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:39.670
I need to see your IDs.

1003
00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:42.070
Gosh, I can't believe this.

1004
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:44.910
I swear we're not underage.

1005
00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:46.410
Then show me your ID.

1006
00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:48.650
This is totally killing the mood.

1007
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:51.350
Gosh, I'm serious.
Didn't you bring your ID?

1008
00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:54.920
-No, I didn't.
-We just didn't bring our IDs.

1009
00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:58.090
What is this? Who asked for this song?

1010
00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.920
It's my dad's song.

1011
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:05.060
I was going to request it first.
You beat me to it.

1012
00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.770
What kind of a song is this?
It doesn't suit the place at all.

1013
00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:11.040
Why? I like it.

1014
00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:15.370
This song is really touching.
It makes you tear up.

1015
00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:17.940
Then I'll leave you to cry.
I need to go to the bathroom.

1016
00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:20.350
Okay.

1017
00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:26.020
-Gosh, this is so annoying.
-My gosh.

1018
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.320
Excuse me.

1019
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:30.990
Can't you see that we're talking?
Do you have no manners?

1020
00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:33.960
Either crawl under my arm
or just use another path.

1021
00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:35.860
She's so annoying.

1022
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:42.870
I'll come back next time for a drink.

1023
00:56:43.170 --> 00:56:44.870
Let me use the bathroom though.

1024
00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:49.240
Okay, I'll be right there.

1025
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:04.760
Go smoke outside.

1026
00:57:05.420 --> 00:57:06.560
What's wrong with this?

1027
00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:11.630
I want to smoke, but I can't.

1028
00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:16.700
I can't light up a cigarette
because my shoulder hurts.

1029
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:21.210
Do you know why? Because you hit
my shoulder and broke my collarbone.

1030
00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:22.670
What?

1031
00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:26.480
Are you talking to me
like I'm your friend?

1032
00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:30.080
You'll have to pay for my treatment,
compensation,

1033
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:31.520
and the alcohol I didn't get to drink.

1034
00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:36.960
You at least owe me 1,000 dollars.

1035
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:40.130
My gosh!

1036
00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:42.460
What do you think you're doing?

1037
00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:44.060
Do you have a death wish?

1038
00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:46.160
Why are you doing this?

1039
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:47.830
I heard your boss has a girlfriend.

1040
00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:51.670
You should teach him a lesson
for cheating on you.

1041
00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:55.040
No, technically speaking,
he didn't cheat on her.

1042
00:57:55.110 --> 00:57:57.940
She may have liked him first,
but she never got to make him hers.

1043
00:57:58.010 --> 00:58:00.280
That's such a cheap expression,

1044
00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:02.350
but it's very easy to understand.

1045
00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:04.180
Hey, forget it.

1046
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:06.720
Daily Guru told me
I'll get a boyfriend this year,

1047
00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:08.120
so mind your own business.

1048
00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:13.060
And he'd be crazy
to not fall for a beauty like me.

1049
00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:19.100
Sometimes, I'm worried
that she actually thinks she's pretty.

1050
00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.870
-Then am I not pretty?
-No, you're not.

1051
00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:25.340
You only come in second
among all three of us.

1052
00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:27.640
Then who's the ugliest?

1053
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:30.580
Gosh, come on.
Don't make me say it out loud.

1054
00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:33.010
Why? Because it's you?

1055
00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:34.510
Don't you have a mirror at home?

1056
00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:37.920
You guys can choose who's the ugliest
until I come back from the bathroom.

1057
00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:40.790
Personally, I think both of you
come in last.

1058
00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:42.850
Get lost. Just go and poop.

1059
00:58:47.290 --> 00:58:49.460
-Use another bathroom.
-What?

1060
00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.560
Can you move? I really need to go.

1061
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:55.270
Then just do it here.

1062
00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:59.040
What are you glaring at?

1063
00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:02.470
Do you want to get beaten up
or just leave quietly?

1064
00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:04.940
-You'll really regret it.
-My gosh.

1065
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:11.550
Come on. Let's make it quick.
I'm really tired right now.

1066
00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:14.950
You hurt me, so you need to pay for that.

1067
00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:18.520
-You must be out of your mind.
-Unbelievable.

1068
00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:23.430
I don't want your phone.
I want your money. Give me money.

1069
00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:30.070
No one is around to help you,
so hurry up and give me money.

1070
00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:42.580
Hey, I don't care what you're doing,
but take it outside.

1071
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:44.480
You can't just hog the bathroom like this.

1072
00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:47.190
Where do you think you're going?

1073
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:50.260
Did... Did you do that to my friends?

1074
00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:52.720
Why? Do you need a beating as well?

1075
00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:55.330
Go ahead and try if you can.

1076
00:59:55.890 --> 00:59:58.760
Where are you going? Just stay inside.

1077
01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.230
Stay right there. Everything will be fine.

1078
01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.000
You'll get hurt, so stay inside.

1079
01:00:17.050 --> 01:00:18.180
Hey, Yeon-joo.

1080
01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.220
What? Where?

1081
01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:25.560
(They normally
don't get beaten up like that.)

1082
01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:27.860
I guess you're here with a big group.

1083
01:00:27.930 --> 01:00:30.800
Can't you see that I'm here by myself?
You must be pretty intimidated.

1084
01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.100
No, I'm not.

1085
01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:34.870
Oh, hello.

1086
01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:38.070
You little... What just happened?

1087
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:43.210
Where is it?

1088
01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:46.240
What the...

1089
01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.680
-Will you please come out?
-Why are you doing this to me?

1090
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:53.280
Why do you think?
I really need to go to the bathroom.

1091
01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:55.820
-Stop it.
-Yeon-joo!

1092
01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:57.960
-Gosh, please get out.
-Stop it.

1093
01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:01.160
-Yeon-joo, are you okay? What happened?
-I don't know.

1094
01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:04.300
-Gosh, what was that?
-What happened?

1095
01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:09.070
Mr. Choi?

1096
01:01:09.530 --> 01:01:10.640
Saet-byul.

1097
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:12.340
Who?

1098
01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:16.340
What the... What happened?
She's our part-timer.

1099
01:01:16.410 --> 01:01:18.910
The girl you told me to be nice to.

1100
01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:21.450
She's the part-timer?

1101
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:26.250
"Yeon-joo"?

1102
01:01:46.906 --> 01:01:47.906
What's the deal with that part-timer?

1103
01:01:47.931 --> 01:01:49.867
I don't like the way she looks at you.

1104
01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:52.469
Hey, she told us not to tell him.

1105
01:01:52.494 --> 01:01:53.977
Are you talking about my part-timer?

1106
01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:55.180
What are you looking at?

1107
01:01:55.205 --> 01:01:57.188
You just happened to be in front of me.

1108
01:01:57.213 --> 01:01:58.633
I like my job.

1109
01:01:59.266 --> 01:02:00.945
I like working at the convenience store,

1110
01:02:00.970 --> 01:02:02.828
and I like Mr. Choi.

1111
01:02:03.124 --> 01:02:04.812
(This is the police station.)

1112
01:02:05.094 --> 01:02:06.531
The... The police station?
