(Ji Chang-wook)

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.210
(Kim You-jung)

3
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.160
(Backstreet Rookie)

4
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.440
Hello?

5
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.210
What do I do?

6
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.320
Goodness.

7
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.330
Is he okay?

8
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.100
I got it!

9
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.840
He's out.

10
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.050
Are you okay?

11
00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:27.860
Can you take care of this kitten?

12
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.220
-I'm running late.
-Okay.

13
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.990
I'm almost there. I'm sorry.

14
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.760
I can see you!

15
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.900
I'm so late!

16
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.300
-Saet-byul!
-Jung Saet-byul!

17
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.670
She's here.

18
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.780
Hey, Wonder Woman.

19
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.610
Hey.

20
00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.510
You brats.

21
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.050
My friend!

22
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.430
Hey, you. Bring me some water.

23
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.960
Hey!

24
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.180
I'm out of breath because I ran,
but I'm also all warmed up now.

25
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.350
That means that you're screwed.

26
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.850
-You're scared, aren't you?
-Aren't you?

27
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.090
This is getting fun.

28
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.640
You know what China pink symbolizes?

29
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.480
Whoever gets this right,
I'll let you off the hook.

30
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.450
-Disrespect?
-Wrong.

31
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.380
-Facebook?
-Wrong.

32
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.250
Stop guessing.

33
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.420
Don't embarrass me.
We easily outnumber them.

34
00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:15.820
Girls, form the crane formation.

35
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.700
(Crane formation)

36
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.270
What's a crane formation?

37
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.000
It's a type of formation, you idiot.

38
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.570
A formula? I knew that.

39
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.940
Five, four,

40
00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.409
-three, two,
-They're all here.

41
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.680
-That's right. You're exempt.
-Nice.

42
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.520
(China pink symbolizes rejection.)

43
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.560
Hey. Attack!

44
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.100
Girls, don't get scared. They're nothing.

45
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.500
Focus!

46
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.660
-Take this!
-My gosh!

47
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.100
Hey!

48
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.210
Okay, stop. Let's end it here.

49
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.180
I won't ask you to join our crew anymore.

50
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.050
It's improper for women
to beat each other up.

51
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.050
Let's talk.
I get it, you're good at fights.

52
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.490
No, a real woman speaks with her fist.

53
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.060
You're so cool.

54
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.100
Saet-byul, I really learned
my lesson today.

55
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:07.840
I'm the prettiest girl,
and you're the strongest girl!

56
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.500
-Are you kidding me?
-I'm serious.

57
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.640
Did you see those girls back there?

58
00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.940
Did you see those stubby legs?

59
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.340
So short!

60
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:19.380
-And what's with the crane formation?
-What was that?

61
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.280
-What's that supposed to be?
-A formula!

62
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.890
What? Do you know this person?

63
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.590
He's so handsome.
He looks like a celebrity.

64
00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.630
Shut it. I'm looking at the flowers.

65
00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.500
Your gaze is definitely not going
to the flowers.

66
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.400
-You're definitely looking at the guy!
-Come on.

67
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.640
It'd be so nice to get flower bouquets
like those.

68
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.810
I bet women love money bouquets more.

69
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.840
I love flowers more. I want to open
a flower shop and live an elegant life.

70
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.650
Call me Florist Jung.

71
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.780
-Nonsense.
-Then I'll become a money-ist.

72
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.900
Can you not smell anything?

73
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.070
-I can smell it a little.
-Right?

74
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.010
-Dae-hyun,
-Yes?

75
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:20.140
did you really have to be like this
on a day like today?

76
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.650
What was it today, a puppy?
Or did you fix a swallow's leg?

77
00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.550
How did you know? It was a kitten.

78
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.020
A kitten?

79
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.950
It fell in the sewer.

80
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:37.430
You're a great guy. You're great,

81
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.260
but you're not for me.

82
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.800
No, I think we're a great fit.

83
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.900
No, that's what you think.

84
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:49.440
What I think?

85
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.070
I should return your baby to you, right?

86
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:56.680
Hold on.

87
00:07:57.710 --> 00:08:01.120
I wish the best for you. Goodbye.

88
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.450
Jung-eun,

89
00:08:04.450 --> 00:08:05.590
don't leave.

90
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:08.820
As if.

91
00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.990
-Hand me one.
-Okay.

92
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:50.360
I'm feeling a menthol cigarette today.

93
00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:52.400
Right? Hey, do you have
a menthol cigarette?

94
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:54.300
I did yesterday.

95
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:58.470
Darn you. How could you smoke it alone?

96
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.730
-What is he doing?
-What's that?

97
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.110
You look like you're laughing at me.

98
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.450
You're a great guy.

99
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.750
You're great, but you're not for me.

100
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.550
If a great guy isn't for you,

101
00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.490
then would a bad guy be for you?

102
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.590
Is that what it is?

103
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.160
Is he drunk?

104
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:58.070
Goodbye.

105
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.210
He's so handsome.

106
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.540
Such pathetic souls.

107
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:15.220
Well, I guess

108
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.320
I'm the most pathetic one here.

109
00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.560
You know, handsome guys like him are
surprisingly innocent and easy to control.

110
00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.760
What am I supposed to do? Just leave?

111
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:30.600
Should I go around?

112
00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.140
I can totally smell the dumb guy smell
from him.

113
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.280
-Ready or not, rock, paper, scissors!
-Rock, paper, scissors!

114
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.840
Yes! Perfect.

115
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.320
Excuse me,

116
00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.190
could you spare me a moment?

117
00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:03.760
Could you get us three packs of
Soboro Menthol from the convenience store?

118
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.270
-Please?
-Please?

119
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.370
Kids,

120
00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.340
are you crazy?

121
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.110
Such nonsense.

122
00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:15.410
You look like a kind man.

123
00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.780
I'm not a good man.

124
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.050
Handsome man, please.

125
00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.850
Hey! You little brats.

126
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.420
You think I'm joking?

127
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:28.390
You think this is a joke?

128
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.190
How dare you ask me to buy cigarette
for you?

129
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.400
Just once, please.

130
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.670
Just once.

131
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.680
Try to quit if you can.
It's bad for your bones.

132
00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.820
-What is this?
-My goodness!

133
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:02.290
-What's this?
-What's with that man?

134
00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:06.330
Kids, you can smoke
when you're all grown up.

135
00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:09.160
Try to put your youth to good use.
Understood?

136
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.200
Stop there.

137
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.870
Stop, my foot. What?

138
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.270
Thanks for worrying about me.

139
00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:54.880
You're the first one who ever told me
to quit smoking.

140
00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.010
What's your number? 010...

141
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.650
-736-5186.
-736...

142
00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.250
No, wait. That's not my number.

143
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.350
Why are you asking?

144
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.150
You told me to put my youth to good use.

145
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.360
-Okay, then.
-Don't save the number.

146
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.930
What are you doing?

147
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.160
-Hey,
-What?

148
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.930
-be careful.
-Of what?

149
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.630
What is it?

150
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:23.970
I don't know

151
00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.910
what I'm going to do to you.

152
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.340
What do you mean by that?

153
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.650
I'm just kidding. You're hilarious.

154
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.290
Are you scared?

155
00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.820
No, not at all.

156
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.960
I'll call you at night,

157
00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.590
so don't block my number.

158
00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.430
I'm very busy, so bye.

159
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:06.750
(Backstreet Rookie)

160
00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:11.520
(Three years later)

161
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:19.260
Welcome!

162
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.700
That'll be ten dollars.
Would you like a bag?

163
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.040
No, we're good.

164
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:34.480
A photo? Would you like a photo?

165
00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.180
-Yes!
-Then

166
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.080
can I take it with these?
These are on promotion right now.

167
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.120
Of course! Can I upload it
on my social media?

168
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:43.250
Yes, that'd be great.

169
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.050
I'll make sure to promote them a lot
on social media!

170
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.250
Give me a moment.

171
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.560
-Make sure that the products show.
-One, two, three.

172
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.730
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

173
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.870
Goodbye!

174
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.000
(With the handsome
convenience store owner)

175
00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.510
Us, too!

176
00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.110
We're just buying this pack of gum,

177
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.410
but will you still take a photo with us?

178
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.810
-Please!
-Please!

179
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.180
Of course I will.

180
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.320
I'm taking it now.

181
00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:15.650
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

182
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:17.850
-Thank you.
-Thank you!

183
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.950
-Come back again.
-Thank you.

184
00:15:19.020 --> 00:15:19.990
-Sir,
-Yes?

185
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.320
you're incredibly handsome.
I'll be back again.

186
00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.390
-Thank you!
-Don't forget about me!

187
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.090
I'm so sorry.

188
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.860
-Study hard. Cheers!
-Will do!

189
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:30.200
-Good luck!
-Cheers!

190
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.230
-Dae-hyun,
-Yes, Dad?

191
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.100
-is that all they bought?
-What do you mean?

192
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.470
Kids like them share their photos
all over social media,

193
00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.110
which is a good way to promote our store.

194
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.340
Right.

195
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:46.610
We can pay for our electricity
because of your teenage fans.

196
00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.850
That's true.

197
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.990
Do you still feel unwell?

198
00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.690
Watching the store all night is
no easy work.

199
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.560
Getting back to work is a lot for me.

200
00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.160
Hey, hire a part-timer.

201
00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.330
Then I wouldn't be in so much pain.

202
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.370
Dad! Hold on.

203
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:07.300
Are you okay? What's wrong?

204
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:08.940
Dad, Dad.

205
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.170
It's acute gastritis caused by stress,

206
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.980
and we're using MPO

207
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.940
with hydration treatment
to make him feel better.

208
00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.310
Doctor, I have no idea what you just said.
Please make it easy for us to understand.

209
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:22.650
He's experiencing indigestion.

210
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.490
My gosh. Indigestion?

211
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.290
You were just fine being at home all day,

212
00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.560
and you just get sick like this
as soon as you start working?

213
00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.190
-I'll be going now.
-Okay, Doctor.

214
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.460
-Dae-hyun.
-Yes?

215
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.830
Did you close the store?

216
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:39.000
The headquarters might give us
another warning if we do!

217
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.670
I'll watch the store. You come back
with your father later.

218
00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:42.370
-You can work tomorrow morning.
-Darn you.

219
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.970
Prick your thumb
if you're experiencing indigestion.

220
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.510
-Mom, calm down!
-You'll be fine in minutes.

221
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:48.780
-What nonsense.
-Dad.

222
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.970
You brats!

223
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.069
-What was that?
-What did she say?

224
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:19.240
Who does she think she is?

225
00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:21.440
You.

226
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.190
Fine.

227
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.760
Fine. Let's have at it. Let's do this.

228
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:19.230
You said a real woman speaks
with her fist.

229
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:23.800
Do you know what wild roses symbolize?

230
00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.200
Why is she asking me about such nonsense?

231
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:27.730
What is it?

232
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.240
Do wild roses stab you in the heart
or make you cry your eyes out?

233
00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:31.770
What does it symbolize?

234
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.580
Ask the Grim Reaper.

235
00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.250
You'll be the one meeting the Grim Reaper.

236
00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:21.020
(Wild rose symbolizes
the love between sisters.)

237
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.760
Dad, make sure
you regularly take your medicine.

238
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.960
-Okay. Why does it hurt so much?
-Goodness.

239
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.300
You startled me!

240
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.130
You got caught red-handed.

241
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.000
Where did you go this morning?
Why didn't you invite me?

242
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:36.770
-What is it? You don't have side dishes?
-Gosh.

243
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.610
Put the food on the table.
Or I'll call the cops.

244
00:20:39.670 --> 00:20:41.510
Cops? Go ahead.

245
00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:44.810
I'll report to the police how you didn't
pay me back for my investment.

246
00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.750
I told you I'd pay you
at the end of the month!

247
00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:51.450
Dad, what happened to your arm?
Did you hurt your arm?

248
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.490
You can't be sick for my sake.

249
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.520
You're the only one looking out for me.

250
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:57.720
I'm all right now.

251
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.990
Are you sure? You're sure you're okay?

252
00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.760
Of course. Don't you know who I am?

253
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.230
I, Choi Yong-pil,
am a real man from Busan.

254
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:09.800
Look at you overreacting. You're okay.
But you still gave me a scare!

255
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:11.270
That hurts!

256
00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.110
I thought you wouldn't be able
to make kimchi.

257
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.840
What? Kimchi?

258
00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.540
Dad, hurry and make kimchi.

259
00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:21.880
Your son-in-law is making a fuss
because he wants to eat fresh kimchi.

260
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:24.620
-Dad, use Korean chili pepper powder.
-Dae-soon.

261
00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.550
Hey, put them all back.

262
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:29.090
Don't take all of the seasoned seaweed!

263
00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.890
You thief!

264
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.030
Dae-hyun.

265
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.260
Dad, get some rest.
I'll go and take over the store for Mom.

266
00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.800
I'm sorry.
You didn't get any sleep because of me.

267
00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.330
No, it's okay. Rest up.

268
00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.800
-Bye.
-Bye.

269
00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.570
-He's handsome.
-Look at him.

270
00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:52.250
(7:30 a.m.)

271
00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:49.340
Mom.

272
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.580
Excuse me. Mom.

273
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.510
-Hey, you.
-Wake up. You need to go to work.

274
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.320
-What time is it?
-It's 7:30 a.m.

275
00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.220
7:30 a.m.? My gosh, my back hurts.

276
00:21:58.290 --> 00:22:00.820
-Gosh. Did you sell a lot?
-My back aches.

277
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:02.460
I only had one customer.

278
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.490
One customer?

279
00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.490
The customer wanted a refund.

280
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.630
I didn't know how to do it,
so I put the stockings up there.

281
00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.830
This? Wait, I taught you
how to do it before.

282
00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.400
-How to register refunds.
-When did you teach me that? Bye.

283
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:16.440
Seriously. I taught you at least 10 times.

284
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:22.980
(4:20 p.m.)

285
00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:20.440
How's the business going?

286
00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:23.140
-Business is bad all around.
-Is that so?

287
00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.550
Well, it's the same for everyone.

288
00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.580
My gosh, the school is out.

289
00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.090
Hello, welcome.

290
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.960
-Hello.
-Hi.

291
00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:39.530
Your classes ended early today.

292
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:42.530
Sir, which snack has
the buy-1-get-1-free deal?

293
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.700
The chocolate sticks have the deal.

294
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.770
-I want chocolate sticks.
-Chocolate sticks.

295
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.400
What do I do?

296
00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:59.010
(1 a.m.)

297
00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.710
(Expired)

298
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:02.520
Why are there so many?

299
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:21.100
(Expired)

300
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.440
(Sales for Dae-hyun's convenience store,
Average sales in Jongno-gu)

301
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.710
My gosh. The sales are awful.

302
00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.690
(8 a.m.)

303
00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:41.920
Look at him. Hey, wake up!

304
00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.960
Wake up now. Hey, wake up.

305
00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.130
Goodness. Customers might walk in.
Hey, wake up.

306
00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.730
(He's been working by himself
without a break for 24 hours.)

307
00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:50.730
-Wake up.
-Take over now, Mom.

308
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.430
What are you talking about?
I brought you underwear.

309
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.640
-Why? Why did you bring this?
-I'm going to Busan.

310
00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:58.170
Why would you go there?

311
00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.810
My cousin wants to buy
an insurance policy.

312
00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:01.880
Of course, I must go.
I'm ranked last in sales this month.

313
00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:05.850
Mom. I've been working
for two days without a break.

314
00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.080
Get a part-timer.

315
00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.320
What part-timer? We're about to starve
because we're not making any money.

316
00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:11.550
How many customers were there?

317
00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.190
-One?
-One?

318
00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.660
As for the refunded stockings,
I bought them in the right color.

319
00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:21.090
But the customer's gone anyway.
I'm leaving.

320
00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.400
Why are you leaving?

321
00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.830
Mom. This is Dad's!

322
00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.800
That looks sexy too. Put that on.

323
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:31.610
Why do I need to look sexy here?
This doesn't look sexy at all!

324
00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.110
(2 p.m.)

325
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:52.530
-Hello!
-Hi.

326
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.400
It's buy 1 get 1 free.
It's 2 dollars, right?

327
00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.060
-Here.
-My gosh. Look at him.

328
00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.200
Can you take a photo with us?

329
00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.370
-Sure. The promotional event.
-Let's take a photo.

330
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:03.800
-That's for the event.
-Okay.

331
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.940
In 1, 2, 3.

332
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:12.250
-Thank you. We'll be back.
-Thank you.

333
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:14.110
In 1, 2, 3.

334
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.430
Gosh, I have to hire a part-timer.

335
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.200
(Part-timer Wanted)

336
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.540
(8 p.m.)

337
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:41.170
(He's been working by himself
without a break for 36 hours.)

338
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.070
Who are you?

339
00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.100
I mean, welcome. How can I help you?

340
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:18.240
I'm here for the interview
for the part-time job.

341
00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.610
Part-time job? What part-time job?

342
00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.380
Oh, right. I'm sorry.
Can you sit here for a bit?

343
00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:30.620
Let me bring a drink for you.

344
00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:35.090
(I'm getting the chills.)

345
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:39.290
(It feels like a dagger pierced
through my heart.)

346
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.730
Could you get us three packs of
Soboro Menthol from the convenience store?

347
00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:55.240
She's...

348
00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.050
I'm good.

349
00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.280
(Choi Dae-hyun)

350
00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:07.120
(You're good? I don't feel good at all.)

351
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.460
What do you mean?

352
00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.830
I already have a drink.

353
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.530
I see. It's a drink.

354
00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:21.470
(Resume)

355
00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:22.900
(Name: Jung Saet-byul)

356
00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.780
(She doesn't seem to remember me.)

357
00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:34.780
(What a relief.
I should send her back quickly.)

358
00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.080
-The position is for the graveyard shift.
-I'm a night owl.

359
00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.190
-But a woman to run the store alone--
-I'm good at fights.

360
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.060
-You live far.
-I don't need to go home.

361
00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.320
Darn it. I slipped.

362
00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.330
That's a mistake?

363
00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:51.460
(Given the way she talks)

364
00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:54.130
(and the Band-Aid on her face
which is a symbol of violence,)

365
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:56.640
(I won't hire her for the job.)

366
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.970
(She's out. She failed. It's over for her.
She's out.)

367
00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:00.410
Out.

368
00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:11.580
Sir, you look very exhausted.

369
00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.990
Try some of this.

370
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:16.660
This herbal tea helps you
recover from fatigue.

371
00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:26.070
What is it? Do you think I gave you
undrinkable tea?

372
00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.510
Well, it smells quite fragrant.

373
00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:36.780
It tastes better than it smells.

374
00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:38.710
I see.

375
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.820
Can I use your restroom?

376
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.420
The key is over there.
You can go around the building.

377
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:47.890
Okay. Have your tea.

378
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.710
Something is definitely fishy.

379
00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.490
(Spicy Ramyeon)

380
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:02.500
-Sir.
-Yes?

381
00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:05.430
Why are you up? Go back to sleep.
It's all right.

382
00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:08.000
What are you eating?
What are you doing here?

383
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:10.440
This? I don't know.

384
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:14.940
Your part-timer made this for me.
It's amazing.

385
00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:16.880
You picked a good one.

386
00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:24.850
What?

387
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.390
What's happening?

388
00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.060
My gosh. Wait.

389
00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.820
-Hey.
-Enjoy it.

390
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:33.260
-What's this?
-Thank you.

391
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:36.060
Wait. What's going on?

392
00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.830
Sir, I can start tomorrow, right?

393
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:43.200
Wait. You know,
I have another interview tomorrow.

394
00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.310
I'll call you later.

395
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:52.910
-Oh, no. I feel awful.
-What's going on?

396
00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.710
Why are you crying?

397
00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:01.190
(Backstreet Rookie)

398
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:04.390
Wait. You know,
I have another interview tomorrow.

399
00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.060
I'll call you later.

400
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.600
-Oh, no. I feel awful.
-What's going on?

401
00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:15.300
Why are you crying?

402
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:19.840
The interviewee won't have
any shot at getting the job.

403
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.080
I'll end up getting the job.

404
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:32.250
(I should have fired this time bomb then.)

405
00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.730
-Hello.
-This is Jung Saet-byul.

406
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.430
She's the new part-timer
for the graveyard shift?

407
00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:44.400
She's a temp. She's like an intern.
She's not a regular employee.

408
00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.470
My name is Jung Saet-byul.
I hope you can teach me a lot.

409
00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.640
You're pretty just like your pretty name.
So was it Jeung Saet-byul?

410
00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:52.770
Mom, it's Jung Saet-byul.

411
00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:55.240
Exactly. That's what I said. Gosh.

412
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.780
Mom, it's not Jeung Saet-byul.
It's Jung Saet-byul.

413
00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.610
That's what I said.

414
00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.850
Goodness, you're gorgeous.

415
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:07.120
Wait, you're not his older sister?
You're really his mother?

416
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:09.860
I thought you guys were siblings.

417
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:14.290
I get that often.
People think I'm his sister.

418
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.530
(-What's her deal?)
-Really?

419
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.460
(She already knows how to flatter people.
She's only 22.)

420
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:23.370
But there's no temp or intern
for positions at convenience stores.

421
00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.440
No. You don't know about this industry.

422
00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:26.870
You're on probation for three months.

423
00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.310
Depending on your performance,

424
00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:30.840
you either get fired
or become a regular employee.

425
00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.210
What do I need to do
to become a regular employee?

426
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.380
Well, it's pretty simple.

427
00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:37.950
Increasing sales, good customer service,
your attitude,

428
00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.690
cleaning, getting regulars,
facing up products,

429
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.990
organizing the storage, no tabs,
and throwing out expired food.

430
00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.860
If you don't meet any
of these requirements, you'll be fired.

431
00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.060
You get it, right?

432
00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:48.090
That's really simple.

433
00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:50.860
I'm done with this.

434
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:54.400
Let's see.

435
00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.210
First, I'll show you
how to work the cash register, POS.

436
00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:01.510
POS stands for point of sales.

437
00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.739
So P, O...

438
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.449
You can't just do that.

439
00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:12.050
Have you worked at a convenience store?

440
00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.090
Yes, briefly.

441
00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:16.790
Briefly? You know
all the cigarette brands, right?

442
00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:17.920
No.

443
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:19.790
Why not? You're a smoker.

444
00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:21.030
I don't smoke.

445
00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.300
Hey, you...

446
00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:27.199
Hey.

447
00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.540
(Do you think I'll fall for your lies?)

448
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:34.210
(You asked me to get cigarettes
three years ago.)

449
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.580
Why are you staring at me?

450
00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.679
No, it's nothing.

451
00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:43.620
Convenience stores sell
over 2,000 different products.

452
00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:48.150
And cigarettes are the only ones
customers don't have access to.

453
00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:49.960
Do you understand what that means?

454
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:52.330
So is this what I do?

455
00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:56.430
Why are you grabbing my hand?
What are you up to?

456
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.330
My gosh, you're no fun.
I was just playing.

457
00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.000
We just met. Why would you do that?

458
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:02.670
Is this a joke to you?

459
00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:05.300
Anyway, look at the shelf
and memorize every single one.

460
00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:07.810
I'll go stock up the drinks. Got that?

461
00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.210
-Yes.
-Memorize all of them.

462
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:13.450
Who does she think she is?

463
00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:40.670
Sir, I'll be back later.

464
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.040
She's leaving already?

465
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:46.050
Hey, where are you going?
Did you memorize all of them?

466
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:47.780
-Mr. Choi.
-What?

467
00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:50.550
-Aren't you going to take that down?
-What? This?

468
00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.690
Of course, I should take it down
when I officially get a part-timer.

469
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.360
You will take it down soon.

470
00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:58.720
-I'll be back tonight.
-Okay.

471
00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:04.300
Hey, the bills are about to fall
from your back pocket.

472
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.470
If they do, I'll keep them.

473
00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.540
That's a slick ride.

474
00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:27.150
My goodness. Something is fishy.

475
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:29.020
Something feels off.

476
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.300
What a surprise. You're already up.

477
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:46.940
I'm going to a part-time job.

478
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:49.210
-Bye.
-I cooked.

479
00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.210
Make sure you eat that
and put it in the fridge.

480
00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.050
Okay. Have fun at work.

481
00:36:58.650 --> 00:37:01.290
Sir, wait. I'm right here.

482
00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:03.090
Hey, where were you?

483
00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:06.060
-I had to make a delivery.
-I see.

484
00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:09.200
There we go.

485
00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.630
Okay then. What can I get for you, sir?

486
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.400
-Here's what I need.
-Yes, what is it?

487
00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.400
-Here.
-Okay, let me see.

488
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:20.070
-Can you exchange this money for me?
-What...

489
00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:24.210
-Oh, okay. Do you want one-dollar bills?
-Yes, ten of them.

490
00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.310
Okay, ten one-dollar bills.

491
00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:28.250
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

492
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:29.720
No problem. Bye.

493
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:32.080
My goodness.

494
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.430
What the... What?

495
00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:52.810
(I'm sure I counted the cash
and put it in the machine.)

496
00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:55.470
No one paid in cash after that.

497
00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:59.110
And even if someone did pay in cash,
it still shouldn't be empty.

498
00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:01.810
Where did it go? What happened?

499
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:10.820
Hey, the bills are about to fall
from your back pocket.

500
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:17.760
No... No way.
Jung Saet-byul, that little...

501
00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:19.270
I'm going to kill her.

502
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.840
What? Why... Why can't I see anything??

503
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.340
Wait a minute. Is this... What...

504
00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:31.540
Doing this won't help me see better.

505
00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.550
(The phone is turned off.
You will be directed to voicemail.)

506
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:43.160
Gosh, why... Why is her phone turned off?

507
00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:48.390
What is it? Do you think I gave you
undrinkable tea?

508
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.800
Gosh, she totally got me.

509
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:57.840
I can't believe this.
Jung Saet-byul, that horrible brat.

510
00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.140
Wait a minute.

511
00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:03.280
(Cash stolen
by convenience store part-timer)

512
00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:07.250
(Hello, I'm the Convenience Store Guru,
a guy whose life)

513
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.980
(revolves around convenience stores.)

514
00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:12.450
(I've been working
at a convenience store for 15 years,)

515
00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.650
(and I'm going to tell you
about how my part-timer)

516
00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:17.360
(stole cash from the store last week.)

517
00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:21.830
(Listen to me, J!)

518
00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:24.860
(You showed up out of nowhere
saying you want to work part-time!)

519
00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:27.000
(-How dare you turn off your phone)
-"J"?

520
00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:29.570
(-and tell me the wrong address?)
-Wait a minute. "J"?

521
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.100
(-If you run a convenience store,)
-Jung Saet-byul.

522
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:35.510
(make sure you check the address
if a part-timer seems suspicious.)

523
00:39:35.570 --> 00:39:37.280
(If it turns out to be wrong,
it's a scam.)

524
00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:39.780
(-This is all for today.)
-Her address. Wait a minute.

525
00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.130
Jung Saet-byul, you're dead.

526
00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:05.270
Wait. What if she's not alone?

527
00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.440
(No credit. Cash only.)

528
00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:11.910
Did you come to die?

529
00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.550
Sorry.

530
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:30.560
My body still remembers how to fight.

531
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.400
Come on out.

532
00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.270
-Oh, my gosh!
-Are you here to pay money for sex?

533
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.940
-No wait. What in the world...
-Hey, stop.

534
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:42.940
You're under arrest.

535
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:44.180
-For what?
-You can hire a lawyer,

536
00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.780
-and you'll get a chance to explain.
-About what?

537
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:47.210
-Did you make a reservation for 7:00 p.m.?
-No.

538
00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.310
You came just in time.

539
00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:51.320
No, that's not it.
I'm just here to find Saet-byul.

540
00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.020
I have tons of names.

541
00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:54.950
Pink, Cherry, Tsubasa, and Mika.

542
00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.420
They call me whatever they want.
I guess he likes Saet-byul.

543
00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:59.190
What are you talking about?

544
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:02.090
The part-timer at my convenience store
is Saet-byul!

545
00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:03.830
Will you please let me go?

546
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:05.970
Stay still, sir.

547
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.670
No, wait. Officer.

548
00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:10.540
Please look inside my pocket.

549
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.870
-Here?
-Yes.

550
00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:15.140
Gosh, you put it in so deep.

551
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:18.040
Take a look. I'm telling the truth.

552
00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:20.980
This is the address,
and her name is Saet-byul.

553
00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:24.420
What did I tell you?
She's our new part-timer.

554
00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.650
And she ran off with 500 dollars
while I went to receive training.

555
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:31.790
I called, but her phone was turned off,
so I thought I'd go to her house.

556
00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:33.290
But what is this place?

557
00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:37.400
-Does it hurt?
-It hurt a lot.

558
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:42.870
Hello?
Mom, are you at the convenience store?

559
00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:47.210
What? No, I'm home.
Saet-byul came and took over.

560
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:49.680
What? Saet-byul is back?

561
00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.210
Yes, she came early
to organize the cigarettes.

562
00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:55.180
What? "Organize the cigarettes"?

563
00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:00.850
What do you think is the first thing
part-timers steal? It's money.

564
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.460
And the second thing on the list
is cigarette. Do you know why?

565
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.330
Because they're expensive and light.
They're easy to sell.

566
00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:10.400
No. No way. My gosh.

567
00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:14.770
Thank you.

568
00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:21.010
What... What is this? Why is it locked?

569
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:27.510
No! My cigarettes!

570
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:29.650
My gosh, I can't believe this.

571
00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:34.890
Dad! Dad, do you have
the convenience store key at home?

572
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.760
Yes, I need it right now!

573
00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.090
Dad!

574
00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:47.730
-Dad!
-Hey! Dae-hyun!

575
00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.640
Over here! Give me the key!

576
00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.670
Here.

577
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:54.110
-Give me that.
-Is there something wrong?

578
00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:56.380
-Later. I'll tell you later.
-What is it?

579
00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:11.220
Mr. Choi, you're here.

580
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.730
Hey! Get over here!

581
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:18.060
-Did you...
-I organized everything.

582
00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.330
I found 1 pack of Camel Blue
and 2 packs of Essence Soo.

583
00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.300
That's three packs in total.
I'm good, right?

584
00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:26.070
-What in the world...
-Didn't I do a great job?

585
00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:29.280
Hey, what... How...

586
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:31.910
What's wrong?

587
00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:35.580
Why did you leave it open?
It'll get dusty inside.

588
00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.120
-This isn't a rice cooker.
-It's similar.

589
00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.850
But what brings you here at this hour?

590
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:42.620
What? Well, I just came.

591
00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.920
By any chance, are you here because...

592
00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:46.690
Because what?

593
00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.400
Did you run over here
because you missed me?

594
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.470
I guess you ran because you missed me.
Gosh, you fall for people so easily.

595
00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:55.100
(Fall for People Easily)

596
00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.940
I can't believe this.

597
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.100
There must be
something wrong with your head.

598
00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:02.710
The ER is open 24 hours a day
just like our convenience store.

599
00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.940
My dad just got discharged,
so they'll have an empty bed.

600
00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:17.860
I bet it's hard for her
to keep that smile on her face.

601
00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:19.960
Her plan got ruined because I showed up.

602
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:27.430
My gosh, look at this.

603
00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:32.500
Dae-hyun, here's your tip!

604
00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:35.740
I don't even want to think about it.

605
00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:38.840
Thank goodness I got here on time.

606
00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:46.920
Hey, you're the convenience store owner
I met earlier, right?

607
00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:52.090
-So I guess this is yours.
-Yes.

608
00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.730
What happened to the part-timer?

609
00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.000
Was her name Saet-byul?

610
00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:01.270
-The thing is--
-Do you know me?

611
00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:04.100
-It's nothing.
-Are you Saet-byul?

612
00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:06.570
-No, it's not her.
-Yes, what's up?

613
00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.410
No, it's nothing.

614
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:09.610
-He said you stole 500 dollars.
-No, no.

615
00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:11.540
-No, don't.
-But the address was wrong...

616
00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:14.580
What? You came to my house?

617
00:45:14.650 --> 00:45:16.250
-No...
-Why was the address wrong?

618
00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.350
We were on a stakeout in Unit 1000.

619
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:20.420
I live in Unit 1006.

620
00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:23.160
-She lives in Unit 1006.
-Show me what you had earlier.

621
00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:24.690
-What?
-The employment contract.

622
00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.960
-Why would I have that?
-It's in your back pocket.

623
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:29.430
No, it's not. Hey, don't touch me.

624
00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:34.670
Look. It's Unit 1006.

625
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.540
Gosh, it's hard to tell
if the last number is a 0 or a 6.

626
00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:41.040
Yes, you're right.

627
00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.680
So did she steal your money or not?

628
00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:45.980
My gosh.

629
00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:53.320
Saet-byul, it's not what you think.
No, wait.

630
00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:57.560
Saet-byul. Hey.

631
00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:59.430
Hey, stop. Saet-byul, wait.

632
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:03.930
Your mother took the money
because she urgently needed it.

633
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.770
Then you could've at least told me.

634
00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:08.870
Your mother told me
she'll speak to you herself.

635
00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.700
And I don't interfere
in other people's family issues.

636
00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:13.770
This isn't a family issue.

637
00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.410
If you had told me, there wouldn't
have been a misunderstanding.

638
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:24.350
You're just like the others.

639
00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.220
-What do you mean?
-You jumped to conclusions

640
00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:29.790
without even bothering to ask me.

641
00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:36.200
It's okay. I'm used to it.

642
00:46:40.970 --> 00:46:42.230
Saet-byul, wait.

643
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.770
Don't follow me if you don't want to die.

644
00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:03.690
You did well, Dae-hyun.

645
00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:28.580
I prefer the clown that's smiling

646
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:35.450
(Score: 100,
Don't be too surprised.)

647
00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:38.820
Nice!

648
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:40.660
You guys, aren't I so good?

649
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:42.860
Don't you think I should become a singer?

650
00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:45.300
Of course. Your voice is so nice.

651
00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:48.530
I'll treat you guys to some drinks
since I got a perfect score!

652
00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:52.000
-What do you want?
-Cider!

653
00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:53.670
-Cider!
-Cider!

654
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:55.840
Sir, can we get some cider in Room 19?

655
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:04.780
-Eun-byul.
-Yes?

656
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:07.090
Get a perfect score on your grades.

657
00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:09.220
Aren't you a senior?

658
00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:13.290
We're done now,
so I was just about to go study.

659
00:48:13.690 --> 00:48:14.790
Come with me.

660
00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:29.740
You're not hanging around
with a bunch of bullies, are you?

661
00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:32.610
What do you take me for?

662
00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:37.250
People easily get suspicious
of people like us

663
00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.590
even if we don't do anything much.

664
00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:42.620
Eun-byul.

665
00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:46.990
Who do you think will be sad
if people start being suspicious of us?

666
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.670
Did something happen?

667
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.340
No, nothing happened.

668
00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:02.370
Let's go.

669
00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:11.450
Saet-byul.

670
00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.550
Jung Saet-byul.

671
00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:17.920
Is she not home?

672
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:22.030
Saet-byul.

673
00:49:39.410 --> 00:49:42.350
Today, let's pitch camp here.

674
00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:44.950
This place is known to be
pretty difficult.

675
00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:47.590
Don't you know me?

676
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:49.860
I always stick by my word.

677
00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.120
Okay.

678
00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:54.260
Then I got your back.

679
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:02.130
(Manse, Hangover Cure)

680
00:50:02.130 --> 00:50:04.500
You won a beer cocktail!

681
00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:09.010
-Drink up, sir!
-Drink up, sir!

682
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:10.710
Here you go.

683
00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:12.640
-It works wonders.
-Thank you.

684
00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:14.110
Here.

685
00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:15.450
-Can we have some too?
-Give us some.

686
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:16.850
Sure. Try it out.

687
00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:20.390
If you like it, you can get it
at the convenience store.

688
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:21.720
-This is nice.
-Over here!

689
00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:23.090
-I'll go there next.
-Come here.

690
00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.360

(Manse, Hangover Cure)

693
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:32.630
We did great today!

694
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:35.830
Saet-byul,
you really are the queen of sales.

695
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.270
Let's eat dinner.
I'll treat you to something nice.

696
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:41.210
I need to go to a part-time job.

697
00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:43.240
I'll buy you beef.

698
00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:45.710
"Beef"?

699
00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.960
(My name is Han Dal-sik.)

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:04.000
(My dream is to become
the best webtoon writer in Korea.)

701
00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:11.870
(Although I dream of getting incentives,)

702
00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.910
(I can barely even afford to pay rent.)

703
00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:16.170
(I dream of writing about romance,)

704
00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.810
(but I find myself writing erotica.)

705
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:23.120
Go ahead and live.

706
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:29.290
It itches so much.
It's been like this for months.

707
00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:39.300
(Therefore, just like any other day,
I sit down and draw)

708
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:41.800
(naked bodies.)

711
00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:48.470
...of creativity.

712
00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:51.310
The pain of creativity

713
00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:56.180
is this very moment where we become one.

714
00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.620
The moment we intersect.

715
00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:04.760
That is when we become one.

716
00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:09.360
The writer needs to get turned on

717
00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.860
in order to produce horny illustrations.

Dae-hyun.

724
00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:07.720
What's with you? How do you always show up
whenever I'm eating?

725
00:53:07.790 --> 00:53:10.520
Hey, I don't show up
whenever you're eating.

726
00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:12.320
You're eating every time I show up.

727
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:13.660
Same thing.

728
00:53:14.430 --> 00:53:15.760
You even added a sausage.

729
00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:19.230
-How was your day?
-Don't even ask.

730
00:53:19.970 --> 00:53:21.970
I almost ended my life
while you were busy working.

731
00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:24.500
Why? What happened?

732
00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:26.040
Listen to me.

733
00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:28.040
You know how...

734
00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.110
The part-timer came here and...

735
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.380
So she did this...

736
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.310
-Then she just left...
-She came and then...

737
00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:36.110
That's what happened.

738
00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.320
So you mistook
your part-timer for a thief.

739
00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.690
But she found out, got angry, and left?

740
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:43.690
-Yes.
-You're a real...

741
00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:46.790
A real human.

742
00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:49.130
Anyone could've thought that.

743
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:51.300
-I understand.
-Right?

744
00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:54.030
She was like that
even when she was young. I know her.

745
00:53:54.100 --> 00:53:56.700
My hunch as a writer tells me
that she won't come back.

746
00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:58.100
-What was her name again?
-Saet-byul.

747
00:53:58.170 --> 00:53:59.910
If Saet-byul comes back, I'll hang my--

748
00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:01.040
Hey, Saet-byul.

749
00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:06.440
What time is it?

750
00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:08.680
Do you not keep track of the time?

751
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:10.980
You're here a minute early.

752
00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:13.750
I didn't want to be irresponsible,
so I even gave up on eating beef.

753
00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.490
He's my friend.

754
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:25.030
Get out of here.

755
00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:27.730
Hey, Saet-byul.

756
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:31.540
This is a beef lunchbox. Do you want one?

757
00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:33.670
Gosh, beef.

758
00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:37.780
There... There's a lot of beef inside.

759
00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:41.250
-Is that Saet-byul?
-Yes.

760
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:44.420

00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:59.730
because you don't know what I might steal?

765
00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:01.200
Saet-byul, what's wrong with you?

766
00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:03.770
Let me make myself clear.

767
00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:04.870
Listen.

768
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:10.380
Do you or do you not know
that I'm a pro at cleaning microwaves?

769
00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.140
I clean them spotlessly.
Look at this. Watch carefully.

770
00:55:13.210 --> 00:55:14.410
Gosh, look at this.

771
00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:19.380
It gets really dirty like this.

772
00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:21.290
-Shoot!
-"Shoot"?

773
00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:23.050
Come on! Shoot!

774
00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.590
Nice!

775
00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:28.390
Shoot.

776
00:55:31.230 --> 00:55:34.270
I'm not doing this because I'm sorry.
I'm doing this because I'm good.

777
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:36.940
It just shows that I really love coffee.

778
00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.870
I'm good at this.

779
00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:45.010
The coffee will taste amazing today
because I cleaned the coffee machine.

Saet-byul!

783
00:55:51.250 --> 00:55:52.850
Okay, fine. I was suspicious of you.

784
00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:54.190
How could I not be suspicious

785
00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:56.650
after I noticed that the cash went missing
on your first day?

786
00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.960
It's partly your fault.
Why did you turn off your phone?

787
00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:00.360
It ran out of battery.

788
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:01.460
Then what about the address?

789
00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:02.590
I don't write neatly.

790
00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:05.100
Who writes six like a zero?

791
00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.400
I do.

792
00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:08.170
Good for you.

793
00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:12.400
Shouldn't you apologize
instead of getting angry at me?

794
00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:20.010
I'm sorry.

795
00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.380
That was pretty quick.

796
00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:23.050
I tend to put things into action
very quickly.

797
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:24.920
You want me to stop
giving you the silent treatment?

798
00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:26.050
Of course.

799
00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:31.020
Okay, then I'll let it go
if you organize the storage room

800
00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:33.360
and fill up the refrigerators
with all the beverages. Deal?

801
00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:35.390
Saet-byul, are you kidding me?

802
00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.170
I love doing that. I'll do it.

803
00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:43.440
Do you want me to help?

804
00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:46.040
-No.
-Why not?

Hello.

809
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:03.860
You should've called.
What if we didn't cross paths?

810
00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:06.860
Then I would've waited
until you passed by.

811
00:57:07.260 --> 00:57:09.290
Yeon-joo, let's have lunch together.
I'm starving.

00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:10.630
-"Lunch"?
-Yes.

813
00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.370
Ms. Yoo, we'll be waiting for you there.

814
00:57:14.770 --> 00:57:16.630
Enjoy your lunch. Bye.

815
00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.370
I'm sorry. I have a lunch meeting.

816
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:24.410
It's okay. I'm fine.
You should go to the meeting.

817
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.480
The fact that I got to see you
is already enough for me.

818
00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:29.750
But I think I'll have time tonight.

Why don't we meet tonight
at Kosirado Hotel?

A hotel?

822
00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:45.330
See you later.

Oh, my gosh.

824
00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:13.320
Hey, Saet-byul. You have no idea
how much I waited for you to come. Hurry.

Mr. Choi.

826
00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:21.570
Mr. Choi, did you put on perfume
to impress me?

827
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:23.230
I love this scent.

828
00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.400
-No.
-Don't lie to me.

829
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:29.440
I promise. My girlfriend got this for me.
She told me to wear it on our date.

830
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:32.440
I sprayed it on my wrists and my neck.

831
00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:37.320
You have a girlfriend?

832
00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:40.020
Of course I have a girlfriend.

833
00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:43.320
But why do you sound so angry about it?

834
00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:47.490
Don't tell me... My gosh, are you jealous?

835
00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:51.860
No, I just feel bad for your girlfriend.

836
00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:53.460
Why do you feel bad for her?

837
00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:55.700
Because you'll have to see me
every day now.

838
00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:59.100
And in the end, you'll fall for me
and get sick of your girlfriend.

839
00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:04.780
Don't forget to tell her
that I'm sorry in advance.

840
00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:07.310
My gosh,
you have a really serious condition.

841
00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:10.220
Aren't you a bit too young
to have dementia?

842
00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.250
Saet-byul, get to your senses.
You can do this.

843
00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:16.850
Stay focused and work hard, okay?
I'll see you then.

844
00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:21.290
-Bye.
-Okay. Just know that I'm watching you.

I shouldn't have told Saet-byul)

This is where you wanted
to have fun with me tonight?

850
01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:07.170
Yes, it's open 24 hours.

851
01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:10.340
So this is what you wanted to do
to get covered in sweat?

852
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:13.650
-You wanted to work out.
-That's right.

853
01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:22.850
What's going on? What were you imagining?

854
01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:24.790
-Dae-hyun.
-Yes?

855
01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:26.360
-Get to your senses.
-Okay.

856
01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.630
You seemed really tired
when I saw you earlier.

857
01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:31.760
You can't do anything without stamina.
You even hired a nighttime part-timer.

858
01:00:31.830 --> 01:00:34.500
You should get some good sleep at night
and work out from time to time.

859
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:37.940
Let's warm up before we start working out.

860
01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.650
-Are you okay?
-Of course, Yeon-joo.

861
01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:55.890
(Can I go to the bathroom?)

862
01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.860
(Why are you asking me? Just go.)

863
01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.960
(Because I don't want you
to get suspicious.)

864
01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:02.490
(I won't ask you anymore
if you promise not to get suspicious.)

865
01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:08.100
(What are you doing, Mr. Choi?
I'm working.)

866
01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:10.870
(Are you ignoring me because you're busy?
Why are you busy?)

867
01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.800
(A customer just bought
a pack of cigarettes.)

868
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:15.170
(He gave me 5 dollars in cash,
so I gave him back 50 cents.)

869
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:16.610
(Here's a photo to prove it.)

870
01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:23.150
My gosh.

871
01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:26.580
Who are you texting?

872
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:29.090
The part-timer.

873
01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:31.920
Hey, Dal-sik.

874
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:35.530
Dae-hyun, do you remember
our field trip in middle school?

875
01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:37.530
It was at Mount Songni.

876
01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.630
We had to sleep at a youth hostel,

877
01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:42.670
but we stayed up all night
because people were so loud there.

878
01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:44.140
Yes, but what about that?

879
01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.640
I'm experiencing the same thing.

880
01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.740
Your part-timer invited her friends
to the convenience store

881
01:01:49.570 --> 01:01:52.710
and are having a darn party
beneath the parasol.

882
01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:57.620
I feel like I'm at a mud festival
at Daecheon Beach.

883
01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.680
What?

884
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:03.760
Saet-byul, why do you keep bringing one?

885
01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.460
Beer doesn't taste good when it gets warm.

886
01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:09.490
The manager filled up the fridge,
so don't worry.

887
01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.530
Your manager does that?

888
01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:16.930
Then who else would do it? I made him
organize the storage room and clean.

889
01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.670
You really are something.

890
01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:23.740
Or do you think
this place has good feng shui?

891
01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:27.850
Should I ask my dad
to just buy this building?

892
01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:29.750
My gosh, let's drink to that.

893
01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:39.190
-Do you have anything with broth?
-Something warm.

894
01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:41.290
Go and get what you want.

895
01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.530
This place is your fridge.
Take care of your fridge.

896
01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:50.130
Saet-byul, you brat.
I'm starting to really like you.

897
01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.770
Is this what you were talking about?

898
01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:57.980
No, I was talking about the new one.

899
01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:03.010
-Is this it?
-Yes, that's it.

900
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:08.120
What the...
My gosh, I can't believe that girl.

901
01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:17.260
-What? Wait a minute. They're...
-This is nice.

902
01:03:17.330 --> 01:03:18.830
Try to quit if you can.

903
01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.540
I... I remember those girls.

904
01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.640
Yes, you got it right.

905
01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:30.040
Are they serious right now? My gosh, okay.

906
01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:33.910
Is she trying to suck me dry?
She's unbelievable.

907
01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:38.480
I'll put an end to you girls today.

908
01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:40.650
You darn parasites.

909
01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.650
Let me get you guys some more beer.

910
01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.190
Will that be enough?

911
01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:49.160
You should drink some hard liquor
since it's going to be your last supper.

912
01:03:58.300 --> 01:03:59.740
Mr. Choi?

913
01:04:29.034 --> 01:04:30.878
Were you very busy?

914
01:04:30.903 --> 01:04:32.331
Does she know something?

915
01:04:32.356 --> 01:04:33.604
You'll probably not talk about it.

916
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:34.949
Do you not remember?

917
01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:37.870
What you did.

918
01:04:37.895 --> 01:04:39.198
You have to tell people to turn a blind eye on it.

919
01:04:39.698 --> 01:04:41.151
Something happened!

920
01:04:43.323 --> 01:04:45.323
How can you sell cigarettes to minors?
